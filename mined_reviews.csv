The Old Guard,10-Jul-20,"Love the concept, execution is not bad (there are some cringy & forced parts), but the music really annoys me. Doesn't fit the tone of the film at all."
The Old Guard,10-Jul-20,"There were just so many clichés, cringe, and naive moments. The dialogue was also simple. The music was not all that good. The antagonist had a cartoonish evil character."
The Old Guard,10-Jul-20,"The actors are all good. Well that's it. The story is childlike, the direction dull and the development highly predictable. The goodies, the baddies and the double crosser. All fluffed up with fight scenes, explosions and gunfire. The action is probably the only realistic thing, even if it is plastered all over the place for no good reason. The effects are all good and have grit.My mind kept referring back to Austin Powers. The baddie is that comical (but not in a funny way). The plot is childlike and felt very amateur. Take the prime star out and this is a B Roll movie that never gets watched.The London scenes at the end were just bizarre. Empty streets and then suddenly full with crowds and Police. Making no sense whatsoever. This quality of story telling is very poor considering who is in the film.Overall, a promising film that immediately failed to deliver anything other that a straight to VHS Sunday story. Lacking the story and direction to make it credible. Then the attempt to create a sequel... so ham fisted in its execution. It just finished on a cringe... not a masterpiece! So very disappointing..."
The Old Guard,10-Jul-20,"I didn't read the comic so I went in blind. I loved it. The story, the action, the fight scenes. Thoroughly enjoyed the movie. I hope they have a sequel or series."
The Old Guard,13-Jul-20,"The beginning of movie is very interesting, but when approaching to mid section, the cliche comes around, all that forced drama, excess of sad dialogues forcing a dramatic life and blablabla, so lazy, almost gave up...The worst part is the ingenuity of characters that lived for like 200 years!! Makes no sense, a dude with 200 years old just make a decision of a boy with 15 years old. After all, the action scenes worth the Saturday night's movie. Oh almost forgot, the ""new member of team"" looks empty, we don't get that real felling of her, also doesn't act like a girl from army...like the story shows up!"
The Old Guard,10-Jul-20,"I really wanted to like this film. It's got a simple but fun premise and it's got Charlize Theron, who's a fantastic actress. But the film is just marred by plot holes, cliched characters, tacky dialogues and hands down the most inadequate music possible for this film.It's still a passable action film if you have absolutely nothing else to watch."
The Old Guard,12-Jul-20,"Disappointing. Looks like a lazy film made for TV, aiming mostly at a teenage audience. Not even a scratch on Atomic Blonde and Mad Max, two others Charlize's action films, which are in a different league to this mediocrity."
The Old Guard,12-Jul-20,An intriguing concept that they don't do much with. Average action scenes but lots of blood. Feels like it could have done with another couple of drafts and some extra writers. Chief bad guy was overacting and a bit rubbish. My main fault was that it just looked cheap - more like a TV show than a big movie.
The Old Guard,10-Jul-20,"A really good action movie. Acting was excellent and the best part from the movie. Pace was great and I actually loved the quirky soundtrack.All characters were interesting and developed in a realistic way. I liked how they appeared like no super heroes, just humans with a very, very long life.The little details: Freeman getting ready and tense as the elevator goes up to the 15th floor, Andy's centuries old ""stuff"" in the old mine, the baklava taste, Booker's story, were welcome pauses from the violence - packed scenes. They managed to make the characters relatable and add meaning to the story.1-1 fighting was choreographed beautifully, even though some scenes felt cliché.I was hoping for a more layered villain, just for balance. The 5 were not pure good so why would he be pure evil? (""to save humanity"" doesn't count, it felt so rushed).All in all, a good movie to watch and a bit different, more human, than most ""supernatural "" action movies, too."
The Old Guard,10-Jul-20,"Why why why so many haters?! First thing I thought was ""wow"" what a great sound track! Cinematographery is on point - nothing missed. Charlize Theron is bad ass for sure! Okay, so there are the odd over the top moments like the endless supply of security guards that just keep on coming. But that aside, all in all, thoroughly entertaining, original and full of action! 10/10 from me! Can't wait for The Old Guard 2!"
The Old Guard,11-Jul-20,"As this film is based on a comic book, similarities r inevitable but it is a solid action thriller.
A short summary - A small group of centuries old soldiers who r trapped in an immortality with the ability to heal themselves must save each other from being caged by big pharma companies. They soon realize that it is harder to hide in this 21st century and so must get organized to erase their footprints but at the same time deal with past grievances.The cinematography n editing r top notch. There is no shaky cam or darkly shot scenes. The hand to hand combat n gun fight sequences r noteworthy.
Charlize Theron is in awesome shape and all the other actors gave good performances.
Another highlight is the music."
The Old Guard,12-Jul-20,"I'm stunned. How can a topic that exciting be executed that boringly? It's a dull movie. Camera work, scenery, editing: uninspired. And that is already the kindest word I can think of. The setup takes way to long. The actors have very little to work with.
Go watch Highlander, instead."
The Old Guard,20-Jul-20,"Really loved the action, the acting and the melancholy feel to it all, much better than just an average action flick, except unfortunately for the incredibly stupid and jarring popsongs which ruin some scenes. Please please please just a decent score for (hopefully) part two. Other than that, really no complaints."
The Old Guard,10-Jul-20,"The premise was good, but they didn't got to do something interesting with it. It was kind of a bore all the way. Also, the soundtrack is one of the worst I've ever witnessed in a movie."
The Old Guard,12-Jul-20,"Really annoying music, movie not terrible nor good"
The Old Guard,12-Jul-20,Not bad but not great either. It's watchable but a tad bland. The script probably needed a couple more rewrites. 5/10
The Old Guard,12-Jul-20,"I wasn't going to write my thoughts after i saw this film, as i usually don't bother to do that. But now it has been a couple of days, and this movie has been eating at me for a little bit, so i felt i had to say what needed to be said.Listen, there is so much woke talk going around these days, woke is the new PC (Political correctness), and i do not immediately draw conclusions just because a movie has a female leading role. Some of the best movies i have ever seen has leading females. For example Alien, Aliens, Terminator 2 and Kill Bill. And, i also really liked Mad Max Fury road, in which Charlize was the leading role, and made Hardy look like a movie extra.I love great movies, with a great story, with a great script, great direction, great acting, great cinematography, great music, great cgi. I love movies that can deliver greatness. This is why my top ten movies and tv series of all time is 12 Angry men, Schindler's List, Pulp Fiction, The Shawshank Redemption, Alien, Das Boot, Apocalypse now, Band of Brothers, Breaking Bad and The Wire.I have seen over 3000 movies in my life, and i have even worked as a movie critic. But of course, my opinion is just subjective like anyone else's, I'm just mentioning this, because i do have some experience with this.Anyways, to try and keep all my points short. This movie has lots of bad acting in it, which is quite shocking when you look at some of the cast. The villain is dull and the story is a mess. And on the flip side we have a carefully balanced cast of white, black, middle eastern and Asian actors, and also two male characters that just happens to be gay.Listen.. I have seen brokeback mountain, it's a really good film. I grew up watching Jackie Chan and Bruce Lee movies which i love to this day, i am not homophobe, or a racist, or a sexist. All i want, is great movies.What defines a great movie? Well that is of course up to anyone to find out for themselves. But when a movie is so obviously designed around political correctness, the movie as a whole will suffer. Why? Because when your goal is to include as much LGBQT as possible, the story itself comes second. And if the movie isn't founded in cement, everything else will fall apart.What i think is weird, is how high this movie is rated, it is only 5 points behind Terminator 2. Just NO! It is 1 point ahead of Kill Bill.. NO! This movie is not even in spitting distance of those two films. Yet still, critics seem to love it.This is evidence of woke, i am so sorry, but it is. There is just no other way of describing it. I have seen this movie, i went in with an open heart as always, and I'm just left with this empty feeling inside of what did i just watch. Bad directing, bad acting, bad script, forced LGBQT story, absolutely horribly bad villain. I shake my head in disbelief, and it is higher rated than kill bill.... ok then.. And another example, it's also higher rated than Se7en and Joker. Yeah no, nope nope nope. I don't care about subjectivity anymore, we are living in a world now, where certain forces are at play, messing up peoples brain.What this movie has, is some cool action scenes, but even those become dull before we reach the half-way mark. Just an endless slaughter of stunt men in black armor gear. Can it be more dull? No.. It can't.In Kill Bill, at least we had Quentin Tarantino at the helm, who carefully crafted each scene, and made action scenes that are among some of the best ever filmed. But Gina Prince-Bythewood is no Quentin Tarantino, to put it mildly. The action is generic, predictable and dull..... So this movie doesn't work as an action movie either. And this sort of deep story they try to weave through the entire thing, about Charlize's loss and how she has suffered, and what she has been through. It doesn't work, they failed. And it is actually because their focus is in the wrong place.This movie is bad.
3/10. Stay way."
The Old Guard,10-Jul-20,"Feels like amateur hour. Script, dialogue, score and most of all directing are all awful!"
The Old Guard,10-Jul-20,"I kinda went into this expecting it to be like a ""popcorn, action summer"" movie but I found it really boring.It moves at such a sluggish pace for the first hour then it kinda picks up its pace but by then you don't really care.That is another big issue is that the characters are very paper thin for the most part. Its main take no nonsense lady, man, man, man and new girl. They are complete characters descriptions of the main cast. Charlize's characters is more developed with a deeper backstory but the others are so interchangeable and forgettable.The action scenes are well choreographed but I found the sound effects a bit too much like every time a sword or axe was used it would make a cartoon ""swoosh"" sound which I get it but I think it could have been tone down a little bit.It's not like terrible and you could probably watch it if you are really board but I wouldn't carve out 2 hours to watch it.Oh yeah it's 2 hours 5 minutes long which is too long and definitely has scenes that could have been left on the cutting room floor to tighten it up."
The Old Guard,10-Jul-20,"Actually a Great Action-Movie with good Fights and a Lot of Violence !The Story is good and there is a lot of Potential for 1-2 Sequels and i seriously hope they make themCharlize Theron just doen´t get old it seems, that Woman is abssolutly Bad-Ass !My Biggest Point Of Criticism is the Musik in the Movie, so freaking annoying and just bad, bad, bad , sorry, but that was seriously the biggest turn-off for me while watching the movieAll in All, Great Action, Good Story, Lots Of Potencial for Sequel(s) , good Acting but horrible Choice of Music in the Movie8 / 10Greetings From Germany"
The Old Guard,11-Jul-20,This is a really cheap TV movie with a couple of big names in it.
The Old Guard,10-Jul-20,"Terrible plot, lousy script, rotten acting and one of the worst soundtracks I've heard. Seriously B-grade rubbish. Don't waste your time."
The Old Guard,10-Jul-20,"If you have read the Graphic Novel before watching this, you are likely going to be disappointed because the novel is so much better.It is grander, Andy is more bad as*, more flashbacks about their old life, and the action scenes are much more spectacular.If you haven't read the novel and just watched this, I think you will still find it entertaining enough though. And I would highly recommend that you get the Graphic Novel afterwards."
The Old Guard,19-Jul-20,"Completely in love with the movie, it's going to be one of those types of movies that I rewatch time and time again."
The Old Guard,15-Jul-20,"That an action film should be exciting seems axiomatic -- so trite as to hardly bear mentioning. However, The Old Guard is more often an exercise in tedium interrupted by mindless action scenes we've seen done before and better.The plot is a mash-up of elements from Highlander and Coronet Blue, a television series from the 1960s, with a dash of shared dreams from Inception. However, as with many current films, the filmmakers seem more interested in exploring social issues than character and plot development.Much of the screen time is devoted to the dramatic question of whether a black female can be a superhero. Of course, this can't be somebody who is just black enough to seem exotically ethnic, with the manners, sophistication, education, and polish of an upper-middleclass suburbanite; but a tough, streetwise, dark-complexioned, cornrow-coifed war veteran who's a bit rough around the edges.So much time and attention is devoted to the training and inculcation of this new recruit, that potentially more interesting elements in the script are given short shrift. One character has an existential dilemma, which is never resolved. An intriguing element concerning the fate of a former member of the team is never resolved, despite the team's paranormal ability to share dreams, but is inexplicably revisited in a postscript scene during the credits.There is no B-story to give the movie emotional depth. The only romance is a homosexual relationship between two of the team members which may offend some, but will leave most viewers disinterested. There are several pitched gunfights with evil minions dressed in full tactical gear with helmets and balaclavas, who are dispatched with surfeit of bullets but minimal bloodshed, and about as much emotional impact as decommissioning robots.Charlize Theron was quoted recently criticizing Steven Seagal's fight sequences and suggesting that her own were more realistic and intense. For action-film fans, one criterion for evaluating action scenes is the length of the shots. In JCVD, Jean-Claude Van Damme does a three-minute scene involving numerous weapons and opponents, shot in one take. That's impressive. TOG employs a lot of quick cuts which only require the performers to master one move. The fights are fairly good, but Pale compared to movies like The Raid and Banlieue 13 (District B13), or the films of Tony Jaa, Jackie Chan and Jason Stratham.The filmmakers seem so concerned with being woke, that they neglect to make the film exciting, rewarding, intriguing or cathartic."
Greyhound,10-Jul-20,I served on a destroyer during the Korean War. This movie really captured the excitement of being on the bridge during convoy duty.
Greyhound,11-Jul-20,"Having served in the Cold War on both a destroyer and on a submarine, I found this story contrasting the tensions between both worlds. The action is shown from the bridge, CIC, and decks of the Greyhound, which BTW is the slang term for destroyers and those who serve on them. Hanks subtly conveys the ache of leaving a loved one behind and her presence with him during the battle. He and his crew feel the presence of the subs stalking the surface ships and the deaths of sailors both above and below the icy water. There is no perfect rendering of combat in film, but the repeated commands and protocols between naval personnel and vessels are accurate enough to convey a sense of proper urgency to the story. Compressing roughly 48 tense hours into a ~2 hour film doesn't give much time to absorb all that's happening, and that's the point. Training and subsequent reactions shape the story in the faces of the bridge crew as they watch the captain and follow his orders which he does not explain. This is about relationships between combatants, among the ships in the convoy, and between U.S. and British allies. This film, The Enemy Below, and Das Boot make a reasonable trilogy for a weekend marathon. Enjoy this story from either a technical or a relational view as you see fit."
Greyhound,10-Jul-20,"Spectacle? Dramatization? No. This movie allowed me to experience ww2 naval combat without the bombast of the usual action movie. It felt realistic with a decent amount of suspense, a glimpse through the eyes of the captain."
Greyhound,12-Jul-20,"Funny... reading the other reviews is what encouraged me to write mine. Most of the low scoring reviews complain about poor character development or thin plot lines. We've had 80 years of movies giving us lots of historical detail, real or imaginary characters development and simple or convoluted plot lines from the World War II era. This movie didn't really need a lot of that to tell the story it was trying to tell. If you're paying attention, you can see the characters develop as the story is told. You can see the scared people gather their courage, the dedicated and loyal people that ""take one for the team,"" and the dedicated captain who will change out of his service shoes bloodied from days of constant wear into the slippers that his girl friend gave him as a gift.There are plenty of movies that have tried to give you complex stories with multiple plot lines and lots of character development only to fail and perhaps try to make it up in the form of some action scenes. This movie was never about that. The action is first and foremost what drives it, and you learn about the characters through the course of the events of the action. This movie was great for Apple TV+ but, it probably would not have been as great for a theatrical release."
Greyhound,10-Jul-20,"This is a movie about the procedure of command. This is an innately more complex task than the more common episodic approach that buries the procedural reality under a mask of plot and character. But this film pulls it off, largely by not shying away from the task.Guess what? Naval warfare, especially the sort of highly asymmetric warfare shown here, doesn't really revolve around the captain demanding more speed while the engineer says she canna take it. If you're looking for a movie that's truly respectful of the labours and sacrifices made in the Battle of the Atlantic, then this is a fitting tribute.Don't expect a character movie, don't expect to spend time below decks exploring the usual stereotypes. This movie is seen through the eyes of the captain, and the captain alone. I can think of very few other films that dare to depict the loneliness of command quite so clearly. There's little time for thought, there's no time to process or even truly grasp the horrors that they encounter (something which forms one of the roots of PTSD). What there is is the fight.The fight is relentless and deeply technical. We've become used to fight scenes carrying a few bits of technical gibberish followed by some visceral and personalised action. There's no gibberish in this film, and the latter consists of the captain cutting his feet on broken glass. The movie, like the mind of the captain, is consumed with the intricate technical and personal demands required to hunt down a submarine at that time. That was clearly the aim here, and the movie has succeeded admirably at showing that particular aspect of this type of warfare. This is not a common way to stage a war movie, but it's worth doing well on a few occasions, and this movie achieves its goal.The reviews show that many come looking for something more conventional, and end up missing the point, which is a shame."
Greyhound,11-Jul-20,"Honestly, I decided to write a review to counter some of the more trivial reviews found in this thread and to try and present an objective perspective of this film.Firstly, the dialogue in this movie is typical for a movie depicting World War II Naval life and is accurate to the time period. Do not watch this film if you expect anything other than period correct Naval terminology or the constant passing of orders between the captain and the crew, as you are not going to be satisfied with this movie. Ninety percent of the dialogue in this movie relates to the business of conducting asymmetrical naval combat in a high-speed situation and is way too short to have a grand introspective or extrospective expose on the psychology of warfare or one's place in the world. Sadly, the short length of this film prevents any adequate amount of time dedicated to forging interesting and dynamic characters or a complex plot with a villain that was somewhat pointless. If anything, the director should have lengthened the film to expound upon the narrative and bring our cautious, somewhat hesitant, captain to life or pick a handful of critical Sailors to develop a relationship with within 80-minute time constraint.Secondly, there are better movies or shows that depict the Battle of the Atlantic which brings me to my second point. If anything; this film should have been broken into a mini-series, like Das Boot or a full feature series like Band of Brothers or The Pacific. Had the directors decided to embark upon that route, we could have had a significantly stronger plot and been able to identify with the characters in a more empathetic way. As a former United States Navy Sailor, I felt right at home with the style, accuracy, and briskness with which the film endeavored to portray. However, I did not find myself overly attached to any of the featured characters. In fact, the film attempts to ""show"" us that we should feel shocked, saddened, or disheartened by the plight of these Sailors, however, without any in-depth character development, I found it difficult for me to feel any more than somewhat saddened, and by the time that I did experience this emotion, the movie moved onto another chaotic event. Reflecting upon the movie now, maybe that is the point of the plot? Maybe, the film tries to showcase that the chaos of battle does not grant us a moment of emotional expression aside from the adrenaline rush of combat or a life-threatening event. In any case, if you are looking for significant character development, and a grander view of the Battle of the Atlantic at large, this is certainly not the film for you.Lastly, I do not, in any capacity, feel like I wasted an hour and half of my life like some of the other viewers felt. For me, it was a nostalgic trip back into an old life that I long forgotten and I enjoyed every minute of this film despite its shortcomings. Has Tom Hanks done better? Certainly. Did I think he did a poor job with this film? Absolutely not. While my main complaint is that this film could have been significantly longer, I am left with a desire to want to explore more in regards to the treacherous Battle of the Atlantic and the men of all nations who participated.Overall - I was pleasantly surprised with this movie, and while I felt that this film could have been produced as its own mini-series in order to develop the plot and the characters better, I thoroughly enjoyed my time, and I am sure I will return to it again in the future.Enjoy!"
Greyhound,19-Jul-20,"Good production, quite intense, very interesting reenactment of a battle at sea, although I am not sure how realistic and accurate it is (those submarines liked to fight a lot in plain sight over the water, right?).My main issue? It was like a documentary, lots of battle time but no much human drama. No time given to develop any characters or even make us feel something about these people.
Ships were sinking in the middle of the Atlantic and we never had a look in the horror of trying to survive this. Even Hank's character felt flat. The few scenes with his love interest were rather awkward and didn't contribute much. At one point we were wondering if the captain was in the spectrum or something..Still, if you are a fan of WWII movies I suggest to watch it for the unique perspective of a battle at sea."
Greyhound,10-Jul-20,"Loved the authenticity and general faithfulness to the technical side of naval warfare. For me, this is a great movie, I love seeing small little details in how the captain commands his vessel, and every crewman doing their job, and quick glances to the CiC trying to keep track of enemy vessels. The movie didn't need to show the crewman following the captain around and repeating every word that Sonar/Radar reports, but it does so and adds a very nice detail that I found to be great, and also helped build the stress and tension everyone was under.My only complaint is that the movie could have been longer. I could definately have watched a 3 hour version of this that took it slower in the style of Das Boot. Other than that, I recommend this movie for anyone that loves the more technical parts of warfare and especially naval vessels."
Greyhound,10-Jul-20,"Though the movie might have been right on technical terms , it somehow did not unleash the potential it hadI felt the movie could have been longer with a better depiction of the enemy to understand the details on strategy betterThe climax (if any) was not up to the markU571 and Das Boot had done a better job long time agoHowever in these time of pandamic with nothing new in the offering; this is worth a watch"
Greyhound,11-Jul-20,"Finally a movie that isn't conventional. We don't have to have character dev. This is a movie about war. If you need a backstory, learn some freaking history because it's pathetic how dumb Americans have gotten when it comes to history. The war in the Atlantic was very long and would be hard to make a movie out of it. How this movie is done, shows how the captains and crew would hunt and destroy Nazi u boats in that era. I'm glad the movie wasn't over 2 hrs like everything else in today's time. If you want to learn what it was like crossing the Atlantic during WW2, this movie is for you. If not, then yea I guess you'll say it's missed potential. I'd have to disagree, though"
Greyhound,11-Jul-20,"This movie may not be for everyone, but as a Navy veteran who has stood watch in CIC this movie is very realistic. I loved that there wasn't a lot of back story. It was more about how lonely and arduous the job of a Navy captain is. Must watch!"
Greyhound,10-Jul-20,"It was just OK which is reflected in my 6 star rating, which I think is generous. They made little effort at any sort of character development. Hanks has some sort of love interest that is hinted at, but that's it. I thought they were going to build some sort of bond between the captain and his Black cook, but that never got off the ground. We know almost nothing more about the man at the end than in the beginning.It's a difficult challenge to portray on film the battle between a destroyer and a submarine. This movie never really pulls that off, it's like listening to one side of a telephone conversation. The German U-boats never seem to be part of the narrative. They try to bring the U-boats in with their radio broadcasts which come across more as obscene phone calls than viable dialogue.Almost exactly half of the dialogue is sailors repeating orders. It got very tedious, very quickly. I thought they went too far in the whole ""navy talk"" department.I found the U-boat attack theme music to be mostly bothersome and heavy-handed, like death wail of a fat man, or a runner-up in Dumb and Dumber's most annoying sound in the world.The sea burial onboard was a moving tribute to our military dead. I couldn't imagine a better resting place than the open sea. I was air force and not really sure what we did. Threw bodies out the back of a C130? That'd be cool with me."

Greyhound,10-Jul-20,"If you have no attraction to military procedure then this film has no selling points.
No backstory or character development. Tedious action and boring dialogue.Back story is no longer then a couple minuets of naval captain leaving lover to go to war.
The rest of the movie is just naval commands I wish I was joking but this film is 80 minuets of rudder left rudder right and sonar positions.Only positive is the film look amazing the visual departments knocked it out of the park.Music was disappointing just generic tension music.This film had potential to be so much better. But the simple fact is there is no major story yet it's some how stretched out over 80 minuets of boring."
Greyhound,11-Jul-20,"One of my most anticipated 2020 films lands with a dull thud. Excluding credits, this movie is 78 minutes long... and 75 of those minutes are spent listening to Hanks scream orders like, ""Left Full Rudder! Bearing Two Niner Zero! Hard to Starboard!"" There is zero character development... and Elisabeth Shue (who gets second billing) has exactly 15 seconds of screen-time. What a disappointment."
Greyhound,10-Jul-20,I had great expectations as I had just finished season 2 of Das Boot. I was disapointed. It fails to even come close to the suspense and the horror of the battles in the Atlantic during WW2. Watch Das Boot instead.
Greyhound,11-Jul-20,No Character development.... I didn't find myself caring for anyone and in these kind of movies I usually find one or two I connect with.... there were nice battles but... there was no plot around it at all..I surprised Tom starred in this... It seemed destined for the B Bin...
Greyhound,18-Jul-20,"It is ok movie, but it is like a short story. There is no convincing character building, there is no back story. A the end you see it as ok short story that could be seen in 30 minutes and not 90 minutes."
Greyhound,10-Jul-20,"My question at the end of the movie was ""Why?""
Why make a movie about such a thin plot? Now, its rather difficult to make these comments about such dramatic events; but we are supposed here to review and rate a movie, not the bravery of those who fought and died in the events told by the movie.
So my question stands; on top of its thin plot, the movie has virtually no dialogues except a series of orders
""Right standard rudder!"" ""Right standard rudder, aye aye!""
""Steady ahead on 091!"" ""Steady ahead on 091, aye aye!""
""Contact bearing port 015, range 900 yards!""
Repeat the above dozens of times and you have 95% of the dialogues of the movie.
Character development is virtually inexistent as it is impossible in a movie like this; even Ha ks performance is just about OK.
So, why make a movie like this?"
Greyhound,12-Jul-20,"A lot of nautical talk and directions/distances, but very thrilling and one of the better war movies made I'd say. I'd rank Dunkirk, saving private Ryan , and hacksaw ridge ahead of this. But then this is right behind those."
Greyhound,20-Jul-20,"I've started to watch with an open mind, but being a seaman and ex navy it's hard to 'not' notice the flaws in this movie. It is a onesided storytelling. First and and formost i hate the computer animation, it is so 'Disney-like', second it is obvious that the seaman and military character is not present in the actors, third, never throughout the war did a u-boat surface at those short distances at all, let alone to commence a surfacebattle with a destroyer, and last, it is not raw enough, that's what made 'Das Boot' such a great movie... Pity... i had great expectations for this movie."
Greyhound,12-Jul-20,"What showed great promise left me wanting for more. What I did see was great acting by Hanks, good cinematography, and potential everywhere, but it was never developed. At the end I felt like I just watched a great 90 minute battle scene.What didn't happen was character development. It starts out with Hanks character proposing to his girlfriend, but learn nothing of her or their relationship. I got the impression she was somehow connected the the Navy, but I'll never know.The crew of the Greyhound is taunted by the Gray Wolf Submarine crew, but we know nothing about them.During movie a mess mate that had served Hanks character his meals was killed. You can see this weighs heavily on the Captain, but again, no depth. No answer to, why? We don't even really get to know any of the crew, or even the Captain.Is it worth watching? Yes, it is a good technical depiction of a Destroyer engaging in a battle with a submarine. Just don't expect the typical depth of a movie worthy of Hanks skill. This is no ""Private Ryan""."
Greyhound,15-Jul-20,"Lacking a back story for the main characters, any meaningful establishment of the broader WW2 situation, and being totally filled with fake looking CGI, Greyhound is a total dud.The entire film is one single battle that felt bland and empty. It lacks any depth what so ever. Thrown in is some commentary about the limited role African Americans played in the US navy that felt shallow and was dimly implemented. Tom Hanks does his Saving Private Ryan mark 2 performance, but it lacks anything new and certainly doesn't save this 'ship-wreck'.The CG looked so fake and is so over-used that I thought I was watching Polar Express a few times. With a budget this big they should have gone to sea and captured imagery that doesn't look like it came from a PS4 on steroids.The run time of the film is less than 90 minutes showing how little there is in terms of story. All there is is the battle, nothing more.You will probably get more emotion from watching a documentary.With the great cast and big budget the film makers could have made a memorable war epic about a critical aspect of WW2, but instead we have this uninteresting pile of rubble. Avoid."
Greyhound,17-Jul-20,"The movie is technically just borderline ok. It's all studio filmed and therefore lacks authenticity of people being on a ship, at sea. It felt too much that I was on set watching the actors as the shots are almost always too close to give wider ""sea"" context. The CGI is PS4 quality. Soundtrack and sound effects are underwhelming.The dialogue is navy technical and sometimes you have no understanding of what they are expressing. 40% of the film is sailors repeating orders. The movie is certainly a golden gem for Navy veterans who understand what it's about.Zero character bond or development. Very difficult to be empathic/care for them. One sided movie with less than 1% German presence in the film.It's 90 minutes wasted, yet it feels like if it was longer, it could have been better developed.This movie is not worthy of being a major theatrical movie nor a premium Apple TV+ movie. A disappointment."
Greyhound,11-Jul-20,"This was a part of history I had no knowledge of. Fascinating study of a man, a leader"
Palm Springs,11-Jul-20,"Films that revolve around characters repeating the same day over and over again has grown very tired in my mind. Groundhog Day perfected it and it really wasn't until more recently with Edge of Tomorrow that I really found a film that seemed to stand out among the rest. Well, I'm glad that I can now add Palm Springs to the list of films to put a clever spin on this concept. This film was originally supposed to play at more film festivals around the world and eventually receive a theatrical release, but things being the way they are, Hulu has now released it. Although this may be a film that's hard to find for some right now, here's why Palm Springs is one of the very best movies to come out of this bare year of 2020 so far.Nyles (Andy Samberg) and Sarah (Cristin Milioti) find themselves sort of bonding over the fact that they both really don't want to be at the wedding they're at. He's the date of someone who cheats on him and she is the sister of the bride, who clearly has many issues. Stumbling across a strange cave after the wedding, they both find themselves caught in a time loop that has them reliving the same day over and over again. Certain things are revealed about each of these characters that add a lot more depth to the story and I found myself incredibly engaged from beginning to end.Where this film shines the most is in the fact that it completely commits to the whole time loop concept, even giving a few winks at the audience. It never once makes any huge mistakes logically, which felt refreshing, especially in the ways it would subvert expectations and most importantly in the way that they choose to conclude the story. The way Palm Springs wraps up was a very entertaining and emotionally earned finale. Now, I feel like I say this about a lot of movies that focus so much of their time on very few characters, but I truly mean that if Samberg and Milioti didn't have any fun chemistry together, this film would've been a disaster. This is probably the most laid back and comfortable I've ever seen Andy Samberg be in a film and it made the entire experience that much better.Only having written and directed a few short films and a documentary before tackling Palm Springs, director Max Barbakow has honestly blown me away here. With a small budget, a small number of characters, and a small scope, this film felt much bigger than it was. I can honestly see a big future for him in the coming years. I will gladly seek out his next project. On top of his stellar work on this film, writer Andy Siara (who also doesn't have a huge filmography as of yet) added a very funny and clever tone to the whole concept. It was clear that the performers were very comfortable with the dialogue because their acting lept off the screen and that just seemed to be a nice mixture of everything coming together nicely behind the scenes.In the end, Palm Springs is a film that I was very much looking forward to, but was wary of due to the concept itself. Thankfully, this is one of the best movies that I've seen accomplish this concept in years. I'm not calling it a masterpiece by any means, but for a fun time loop movie, I really couldn't find many issues. At a mere 90 minutes, this movie flies by and has just enough clever surprises for those who may not have been completely engaged. While the idea itself has grown tired for me, this movie is undeniably hard to dislike. Everything about this movie put a huge smile on my face and if that isn't what the world needs right now, I don't know what is."
Palm Springs,10-Jul-20,"Palm Springs is just such a good time of a movie, i was smiling for just about the entire runtime. Andy Samberg kills as always, and so did Cristin Milioti, they are both extremely likeable and have great chemistry together.I liked happy death day a lot, and I am very much not unhappy with the trend of Groundhog Day genre movies. This is now my favorite one. It's so inventive with it's story I couldn't predict what was gonna happen at nearly any point. So many clever twists to a story that could get tiresome quickly if not done right.Props for casting Connor O'Malley and Jenna Friedman in smaller parts, they both rule. #MinionSquadThis is a greatly enjoyable and fun movie, that I would recommend to just about anyone. Watch it"
Palm Springs,13-Jul-20,"I was expecting a conventional rom-com where the guy meets the girl, but this one has a little twist. It's smart-funny, well written some of the shots are gorgeous and very wholesome. It's a fresh take for this type of ""genre""."
Palm Springs,16-Jul-20,"Palm Springs is ""One of those infinite time-loop situations you might have heard about"". Palm Springs is a Rom-Com about Nyles (Andy Samberg) and Sarah (Cristin Milioti) two wedding guests stuck in a time-loop forced to relive the same day over and over again. Samberg and Milioti are great together as Nyles and Sarah. The CGI may not have been great, but that didn't take away from the many laughs I had during the movie. Palm Springs is a great movie, and if you haven't yet watched it, watch it."
Palm Springs,12-Jul-20,"I was flipping through Hulu one night and saw this movie pop up, I saw it was Andy Sanberg and the cute chick from HIMYM, I thought hey maybe it'll be good for a chuckle, and if not, eh who cares. But it was a perfect late night gem, I love coming across movies or shows that I genuinely like by accident and with no expectations going in."
Palm Springs,12-Jul-20,"A good thing about movie is that it doesn't last long, it has a story and a beautiful message. You will laugh, I promise."
Palm Springs,10-Jul-20,"Groundhog Day gave us some pretty realistic scenarios about life but still Bill Murray was grumpy as we saw the beginning of his character's curse. Here we don't. We meet Andy aka Nyles when he has already lived the same day for years and have had made peace with it. Cristin aka Sarah, on the other hand is new and starts out grumpy but becomes the adventurous one.J.K. Simmons is also beautiful in his character, although a short storyline. They took Groundhog Day and added some ""stoner existencial crisis"" type feels and added a beautiful romantic angle with an appropriate cinematography. This movie works on multiple levels, a weekend watch, a romantic watch and a fun watch. Although, there are some explicit scenes but in all they just add to the overall amusement.It opened with a bang in Sundance and is surely worth a watch.Cheers."
Palm Springs,12-Jul-20,"I really wasn't expecting a ton from this movie, I expected a pretty decent romantic comedy and I also love Andy so I was excited to give it a shot. But WOW was I very very pleasantly surprised!! I literally started it over immediately after finishing it cause I liked it so much. Completely not what I was expecting but I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I laughed out loud multiple times, and the story is completely amazing in my opinion. Highly recommend if you're wanting a quirky comedy, but it also has very cute moments. LOVED it. I hope it gets the recognition it deserves."
Palm Springs,17-Jun-20,"Palm Springs is a flat out hilarious comedy! The story itself has been done before and some have been great (Groundhog Day, Edge of Tomorrow, etc.) but Adam Samberg makes this one of the better ones. If you don't find this movie funny then something is wrong with you! Give it a chance and you will not be disappointed!"
Palm Springs,10-Jul-20,"This movie is utterly wonderful. It's heartfelt, romantic, real, and topical. It made me think, laugh, and cry.The Groundhog Day setup may seem stale, but they get so many fresh ideas out of the concept that it solidifies this film as a future cult classic.I was never really a Samberg fan. I am now!"
Palm Springs,14-Jul-20,"I'm a huge fan of time loop movies and this one might be in the top 5 of those I've seen.The first half is fun and enjoyable. Samberg and Milioti are great and work well together, and the use of multiple people experiencing the time loop - something that's surprisingly rare for time loop movies - works well. Samberg's usual over-the-top schtick is turned down to 25% here, which made the movie more enjoyable for me, as it meant the humour meshed well with the somewhat more serious vibe of the movie.Where the movie faltered for me was around half way through the movie where it switches from fun to drama. As with a lot of stories, this is when the world falls apart for our protagonist(s) and they need to fix things to get back on top and come out stronger than before. But here the resolution is not greatly satisfying, so it's not really worth the switch from fun. The ending itself is not the worst they could have gone with, but even that feels somewhat underwhelming. In fact, despite the movie having a somewhat unique premise, the last act of the movie feels like the generic final act that a lot of rom-coms movies use. I also didn't find Samberg's acting to be fantastic when he needed to act more serious, although that issue only stood out to me a few times in the film.Overall, though, the movie was good. It did something a little different with the time loop concept, the good parts of the movie were really enjoyable, and even if the second half wasn't fantastic it didn't ruin the entire film. So I'd recommend this to anyone who likes the sound of a semi-serious rom-com time loop flick. (And now that those 90 minutes have come and gone for me, I wish they'd actually made it an 8-10 episode miniseries instead.)"
Palm Springs,18-Jul-20,"Ha! This movie is bold, sweet, and funny!I'm 65 years old and generally a prude when it comes to sex and violence. But this was a charmingly-delightful experience into a clever time-loop snafu, so I got over the cartoon sex and cartoon violence.Andy Samberg captures some of Bill Murray's frustration in Groundhog Day but then makes it charmingly his own. Andy is exhausted but then added into the mix is the captivating Cristin Milioti. And then things just take off in a bizarre way.The bar dance was mesmerizing and hilarious. Bonus points for the great J.K Simmons who stole every scene he was in. Bonus points for the amazing chemistry of Samberg and Milioti.I'll let the rest of the reviewers discuss direction, set design, editing, and cinematography - but all were perfect.In a normal year, this film would've garnered many academy award nominations. Maybe Best Picture would've gone to such a unique comedy. Who knows how the 2020 AA will shake out but this movie is just charming and delightful. Watch and enjoy! It's laugh-out-loud fun and just so sweet."
Palm Springs,10-Jul-20,"Im not gonna spoil anything or say anything else about the movie, if you've watched the trailer your just thinking to yourself ""oh another groundhog day"". This movie goes beyond what it is intended and leaves you laughing and feeling better than before you watched it. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
Palm Springs,12-Jul-20,"Thought I was not the rom com type, but this flick takes the cake. Such a refreshing and original premise and bombshell ending."
Palm Springs,16-Jul-20,The time loop shtick has been done a number of times but this new film takes it and puts a great romantic comedy spin on it. Andy Samberg and Cristin Milioti are great and their chemistry is off the walls. Watch it for a great time.
Palm Springs,14-Jul-20,"Palm Springs was an okay movie. Script vice, the movie doesn't really offer anything new. The characters find themselves into a time loop and they just follow every classic rom com trop until the final ending. We don't get to know them, we don't get to understand them, or to understand the whole time loop concept really. The whole thing can be described as generic at best, with some odd touches here and there. The performances, in addition, were okay but nothing special. For all it's worth, it is not a waste of time, but nothing special either."
Palm Springs,15-Jul-20,"I turned on Palm Springs last night since everyone is talking about it, and it has gotten rave reviews from both audiences and critics, which is kind of a rarity these days, and it also has Andy Samberg in it. It really sounds like it can't go wrong... but, it does.Throughout its run-time, I don't think I laughed even one time. Its trailer advertises it as a comedy, and everyone on here calls it hilarious, but seriously I didn't even laugh once. It starts off as almost like a sci-fi horror movie ala You're Next meets Happy Death Day, but after those first 15 minutes, it becomes to drab and mundane.I really don't think I've seen more people cry in a supposed comedy. Every 5 minutes someone is either crying or teary-eyed. And there is no comedy at all to be found. It's not darkly funny, it's not silly funny, it's just overall not funny. At all. But it's also not sad either.It's not a total waste because it is beautifully shot and well acted, but those are about the only two good things I can say about this. I just don't get it. Not sure what all the hype and ranting and raving is about."
Palm Springs,11-Jul-20,Movie was okayish at best. Definitely not worth 9/10 rating people are giving it. Good for a one time watch.
Palm Springs,10-Jul-20,"Gorgeous movie with a great premise, time loop movies are something that I will never get enough of! This movie certainly met my expectations. The twists were subtle and surprising which is hard to come by considering the fact that the same day kept happening over and over. All in all, a fun film!"
Palm Springs,13-Jul-20,"Wow! This film was such a breath of fresh air. It's exactly the kind of film you need more of, during difficult times like these. The basic thread is borrowed from films such as Groundhog Day and Happy Death Day. However, thanks to the clever treatment of its core concept, the infectious chemistry between the leads Andy Samberg and Cristin Milioti, a solid supporting act from the ever-dependable J.K Simmons, and a brisk runtime of 90 minutes, Palm Springs is a winner all the way.Palm Springs will now be looked upon as one of the ingenious entries among films that deal with infinite time loops. More than being just a romantic comedy (which it is damn good at!), it also succeeds in putting forward relevant questions about life, relationships, routines, happy moments, and realizations. And most of them get answered too, within the film's context.Nyles (Samberg) and Sarah (Milioti) forge an unlikely connection on the latter's sister's wedding day. As Nyles and Sarah hook up, Roy (Simmons) shows up trying to murder Nyles and all 3 of them are drawn to a vortex that makes them relive the same day over and over. Palm Springs doesn't try to dig deep into the tedious scientific details of a time loop; writer Andy Siara and director Max Barbakow clearly know what they want to extract out of this idea.As a result, you get a rom-com that works well as a character study (Milioti is awesome; why don't we get to see her in more films?). Nyles has been in the loop longer and has grown to accept this repetition of events. Sarah, on the other hand, clearly was going through a lot (in terms of how she's perceived by her own family) and wants out of the loop. Roy is seen to be out occasionally seeking revenge against Nyles for bringing him into the loop. Do these characters attain closure the way they want? The film has some interesting tricks and laughs up its sleeve.Some of the humor stems from situations when the lead duo is trying to live it up while in time captivity but is not restricted to just that. Sarah is a well-written character as is Nyles, and the film benefits a lot from its quirky writing and energetic performances. Palm Springs is definitely a film that I'll watch again and I know I'll like it a lot more each time."
Palm Springs,12-Jul-20,"This movie now is one of my favourite time loop movies.
Funny, hilarious, enjoyable and romantic. ❤❤
Do not think twice and watch it !!"
Palm Springs,11-Jul-20,"While Groundhog day was much more inspiring and transformational for it's main character, the characters in this movie seem to end more or less in the same place they started - being sarcastic and superficial. The first half of the movie was better, had some funny moments and interesting scenarios. But the 2nd half just turned into a very generic rom com and the end result was flat and uninspiring."
Palm Springs,10-Jul-20,"Palm Springs works on just about every level. It has some genuinely funny moments, its heartwarming at times, and Andy Samberg/Cristin Milioti are fantastic and have great chemistry together. It's a romcom with a twist (which you should try to not know going into it) and it executes on its premise as effectively, if not moreso, as many other movies/TV shows with the same twist. Overall, I'd highly recommend this movie and would say that just about anyone can enjoy it."
Palm Springs,18-Jul-20,"While the basic thread is borrowed from films such as 'Groundhog Day' (Harold Ramis, 1993) and the recent 'Happy Death Day' (Christopher Landon, 2017), 'Palm Springs' benefits from the clever treatment of its core concept, the quirky writings, energetic and infectious chemistry between Andy Samberg and Cristin Milioti, a solid supporting act from J.K. Simmons, and a brisk runtime of 90 minutes. Enormous and exhilarating fun."
Palm Springs,18-Jul-20,"I'm impressed that people are still able to find new, original spins on the classic Groundhog Day premise of repeating the same day over and over. Palm Springs is a unique and compelling film that blends so many genres together into a dazzling package. It's slightly absurd at times, but that just adds to the charm of it. Andy Samberg is hilariously goofy and Cristin Milioti does a lot of the dramatic heavy lifting. This is just a really enjoyable, wonderful film that deserves to be seen and will undoubtedly make you happy."
Hamilton,03-Jul-20,"I mean, i WAS pretty high, but still.It definitely lived up to my hype."
Hamilton,03-Jul-20,Although many musical adaptations have flopped this may have proved that best way to do it is simply film the play. What you get is one of the best musicals available to watch whenever you like at an affordable price. Great work by everyone involved especially Lin Manuel Miranda.
Hamilton,03-Jul-20,"Just in time for the Fourth of July, Disney+ is doing a solid for anyone who couldn't get a ticket to the Broadway sensation known as ""Hamilton."" All 160 minutes of it, including a very brief intermission and some minor censoring of language, will be streaming on the service starting July 3rd. Shot over two nights in 2016 with most of the original cast, including all its Tony winners, this is more than just a filmed performance. Great care has gone into making this as cinematic as possible. The camerawork, editing and direction also bring the one thing you couldn't get at the Richard Rogers Theatre: a closeness that allows you to see the emotions (and the sweat) on the performers' faces. Director Thomas Kail (who also helmed the stage production) uses his close-ups judiciously, but manages to keep this level of intimacy even when we're able to see the entire stage and all its performers.With its PG-13 rating, this is the most adult movie to appear behind the Walt Disney castle logo. It's certainly raunchy in ways Uncle Walt wouldn't have approved, most notably in depicting the adulterous events that led to the Reynolds pamphlet, a Sidney Sheldon-worthy tell-all published by its protagonist, Alexander Hamilton (Lin-Manuel Miranda). ""Well, he never gonna be President now,"" sings Thomas Jefferson (Tony winner Daveed Diggs), a conceit that seems particularly quaint and hilarious when you consider who was elected to that office the year ""Hamilton"" won 11 Tonys and the Pulitzer Prize.In fact, the timing of this release continues to put the musical in conversation with current events, specifically the recent spate of stories of people of color being delegitimized in, or completely left out of, boardrooms, writers' rooms and other places where decisions were made. When Aaron Burr (Tony winner Leslie Odom, Jr.) sings about wanting to be in the ""room where it happens,"" the lyrics are accompanied by the deliberately loaded image of a Black man singing them. ""Hamilton""'s casting of mostly Black, Latinx and Asian performers to portray real-life people we knew were White (and, lest we forget, slaveowners) is questionable only if one doesn't consider that a major theme of Miranda's book is not only who gets to tell this American story, but also that the subjects themselves don't really have any control over the storyteller. With the past few weeks filled with White voiceover artists voluntarily stepping aside to let Black artists voice their Black characters, I'm sure this casting conceit will be litigated once again in the whataboutism court of public opinion.But I digress.Since the ""Hamilton"" soundtrack has been on the charts since its release, a lot of viewers will finally have a visual context for the lyrics they know by heart. Starting with the opening number, ""Alexander Hamilton,"" Miranda crams an ungodly amount of exposition and history into his lyrics, often using rap as a means to his end. Odom's Burr, the self-proclaimed ""damn fool that shot"" Hamilton and the cast detail the early years of our hero, tracing him from the Caribbean to New York City. It's our first look at Paul Tazewell's costume design and Howell Binkley's lighting, both of which will be showcased by cinematographer Declan Quinn and Kail's superb framing. We're also introduced to the main actors' voices, each distinct and wonderful in their own right. This opening, and other detail-filled songs, are to millennials what ""Schoolhouse Rock"" was to my generation, though ABC would have found this too dangerous to spring on us kids.The greatness of Miranda's songs lies in the diversity of their musical styles and the choices he makes for each number. Since almost every word in the musical is sung, it's a lot of fun discovering what combination of rap, r&b, gospel and power ballad he'll employ. He gives the one truly old-school Broadway show tune, the catchy yet terrifying ""You'll Be Back"" to King George III (a deliciously snarky Jonathan Groff), as if symbolizing the difference between the old country and the scruffy colonists who are rebelling against it. Miranda effortlessly changes gears when he wants to reach for the larger emotional moments that resonate all the way to the back of the theater, most notably in the songs of the Schuyler sisters, Angelica (Tony winner Renée Elise Goldsberry), who pines for Hamilton and Eliza (Phillipa Soo), who marries him.Again, the intimacy of Kail's camera works wonders here. The emotions on the actors' faces as they sing are so lovingly embraced, especially when they're pouring out their hearts. He captures the paternal love in Burr's eyes when he sings to the daughter he hopes to live long enough to see grow old. We're close enough to see Eliza's mind working as she wonders if she can compete with her husband's ambitions of not throwing away his shot. Angelica practically vibrates with love and protection for her younger sister. And every beautiful smirk of Diggs' face is captured, whether he's Lafayette in the first act or Thomas Jefferson in the second. As the latter, Diggs wears a purple outfit that looks lifted from one of Prince's Paisley Park walk-in closets.As Hamilton, Miranda is excellent, giving himself a line about immigrants that's bound to stick in the craw of some people. He's in a carefully calibrated co-lead with the spectacular Odom. Burr wins the duel here, but Miranda is the show's MVP and its creative genius. The one place where ""Hamilton"" falters slightly-and I had this problem on Broadway as well-is in its depiction of George Washington. Christopher Jackson is wonderful in the role (my God, this man can sing) but while everyone else gets dinged enough to balance their legends with their humanity, Washington kind of gets a pass. He's seen reverentially, which works quite well with Jackson's larger-than-life portrayal, but whereas everyone else breaks free from the bland lessons I got in history class, Washington feels like he's still trapped in my textbook.The viewer is always aware that this is a live production filmed with an enthusiastic audience. There's applause after every number, and in wide shots that capture the turntable portions of the set, we can occasionally see the audience and the orchestra pit. This adds a welcome ""you are there"" feeling to the proceedings. It's said that live theater is like catching lightning in a bottle in that every night is different and can never be repeated. It's nice to have a bit of that lightning at your disposal courtesy of this movie.Even nicer is how the representation provided by the actors of color forces the viewer to consider what might have happened if people who looked like the performers were actually allowed to take part in crafting the American ideals and the laws of this then-burgeoning nation. Our ancestors built this country, and their descendants are still begging for equality, still fighting to be in the room where it happens. No matter how entertaining this iteration of ""Hamilton"" is-and it's massively entertaining-these ideas are always lurking nearby, demanding consideration."
Hamilton,03-Jul-20,"I've been lucky enough to catch the show on tour in Minneapolis and it was amazing. As another reviewer said, this is how all Broadway productions should be released - not all Hollywood stylized - but a live filmed production of the original cast before an audience. About as close to perfection as you can get it."
Hamilton,03-Jul-20,"I'm a mexican boy who has never got the chance to go to Broadway, all I've seen are bootlegs, and they're fine but not like this. This is a beautiful shot of the great spectacle Hamilton is, the flawless music of Lin Manuel Miranda, the production, the photography, costumes. And the acting, Leslie Odom Jr., Renneè, Miranda and Daveed Diggs shine on their roles, I don't know is this can be nominated for any award, but damn it deserves it"
Hamilton,03-Jul-20,This was fantastic. A musical so amazingly done! The characters and singing are fantastic! Auto tune has taken over the music department but not with this! These are their real voices! 10/10!
Hamilton,25-Jul-20,"Hamilton (2020) :A Broadway Musical Phenomena in Astonishing and Mind-Boggling Cinematic Experience. So, this is how it's done when you want to transform a live recording into Cinematic Experience. Hamilton is a lyrical and musical juggernaut which is more than enough to blow your mind even if you are not able to watch it in theatre. I have just finished watching this amazing show and i didn't even realise when those 160 minutes passed by. I have seen many musical classics from old Hollywood such as 'Star Is Born', 'Wizard Of OZ', 'Singin In The Rain', 'West Side Story', 'My Fair Lady', 'Sound Of Music' and 'Oliver' but all those were feature films and Hamilton is a live recording that's what makes it an astonishing achievement in musical genre. Another achievement for Hamilton is, it is musical from the first minute till the last and that makes it longest musical flick. I never thought any modern musical will grab me so tight and leave me speechless but Hamilton did this unimaginable thing. It's a biographical musical drama based on the life Alexander Hamilton, one of America's foremost founding fathers and first Secretary of the Treasury. Like i said many times the real life events make better and more dramatic conflicts than fictional writting and Hamilton is another proof of it. The first 40 seconds in the beginning scene and i was into it completely, i felt like i was sitting there and watching them Live and i didn't lose that feel for next 159 minutes. It kept coming and coming and i was keep blowing myself and i was like, i shouldn't blink or i will something and thanks to the subtitles which helped a lot to understand the accent. The kind of experience and atmosphere Hamilton created is hard to forget as even right now while writing this i just can't get over it. Each and every artist in this amazing show is more than amazing. I mean how did they do everything so accurately without compromising anything, without losing a single cent of essense. Hamilton is a Musical juggernaut i said but technically it is even more brilliant and how? When an electrical device like lights generate moods and fluctuates it then you know there is something special in it. The choreography derives moods and synchronises all the situations happening at different places and different times so nicely that it almost looks an impossible thing. And the cinematic impact it leaves is staggering. Thomas Kail's direction is absolutely Marvellous. I don't know how he crafted and set it up but i am totally blown away by his efforts. The choice of story is excellent too because it has everything what any freaking fantastic narrative needs. First we realise that Hamilton is an emerging Legend then we come to know about his extramarital affair and we start despising him and then we again start loving him when he confesses his sins openly. If it was a fictional writing then i would have never wanted his faithful and Lovely wife to forgive him for cheating on her but that's what actually happened in reality so i can ignore it. Among all the films have seen in 2020 Hamilton is the Best Movie so far and if it's eligible then i expect at least couple of Oscar dolls in worst case. Whether you are a music lover or not just don't miss this Musical Masterpiece !RATING - 9/10*"
Hamilton,04-Jul-20,WOW speechless after watching this. A true masterpiece. After years of curiosity I can't believe it lived up to and surpassed the intense hype. It really is beyond special and I think everyone should see it. Profoundly moving and extremely entertaining.
Hamilton,03-Jul-20,No one throw away their shot and please watch Hamilton!
Hamilton,04-Jul-20,"I started watching this out of curiosity and to say I have seen it, being the cultural touchstone that it is. At first, I was a little detached, not liking the songs too much, and thinking I would probably just skip through to end in a minute. I couldn't stop watching and it really sucked me in. I have to say, I'm not sure I would have enjoyed it at all, live in the theater. I benefited greatly from the captions and the ability to put it on pause to consult Wikipedia from time to time. The lyrics were so clever and really told the story. I ended up very moved and almost cheering at the end. Of course, now that I am familiar with the story, I would love to see it live and would enjoy it immensely. But I would strongly recommend this for a first time viewing. I will definitely re-watch. And probably again and again."
Hamilton,03-Jul-20,"Hamilton became the most popular musical in recent years for a good reason. It tells an interesting story through beautiful lyrics, music, and acting. The Broadway musical is incredible, and anyone who was able to see it in person are extremely lucky. With the recording finally released, anyone can get the front row feeling in their home.To the many who have listened to Hamilton countless times, this is your movie. To the many who have never seen Hamilton and know nothing about the revolutionary war, this is your movie. Hamilton tells the story of a founding father. It tells of his success through his many failures and flaws.Personally, I loved the recording. It felt very well produced. The mixing was great, except I felt like some songs could have been louder for emphasis. An additional thing that I would like to say is that there is no autotune in this recording, which makes these three shine: Christopher Jackson, Daveed Diggs, and Phillipa Soo.9/10, very rewatchable."
Hamilton,08-Jul-20,"This was an exciting thing for me. I, like most people, had heard of Hamilton. It was/is a HUGE phenomenon on Broadway and launched the careers of some incredible people. Miranda is always the fun, quirky, goofy musical wizard that pops up in shows now and then. Leslie Odom Jr. has always had this impishly wicked energy to him. Oh, and lets not forget Daveed Diggs, the up and comer who, after Blindspotting and a couple other things, I would watch in just about anything. Unfortunately, I live light years away from any decent stage so the odds of me seeing this in real life seemed like something that may just never happen. Enter the magical world of Disney and I am given the opportunity to finally experience the phenomenon myself, albeit not in the original form. Of course, with all the build up and all the hype, I was worried it couldn't possibly measure up.Now, to be perfectly honest, I knew next to nothing about this before watching it. I knew that Miranda created it, I knew Diggs was in it and I had some vague notion that it was about Alexander Hamilton, the founding father, and that it was a musical. I know that might seem like a lot and yet when this kicked off I felt completely blindsided by what I got. The music was catchy in a way I hadn't anticipated, to the point that I'm listening to the soundtrack right now as I write this out. The performances were full of life and energy and charisma, every character so wonderfully brought to life with Miranda and the performer's visions. Though, I have to say that Jonathan Groff as King George was an absolute scene stealer every second he was on stage.There are two magic tricks I think Hamilton not only pulls off, but pulls off effortlessly. First, the cast is remarkably diverse. This is never made into a ""thing"" or used as some tool to drive home some clumsy point in the way a lot of movies do, instead they're just people, people who do an exceptional job and I love that. I never once felt like a single person was miscast or not befitting their role and honestly, the fact that they never draw overt attention to it allows each actor to simply play their part exceptionally. Secondly, this draws attention to an imperfect man of great significance in American history that... Yeah, I'm sure I learned about him in school but honestly didn't know all that much about him. The fact that they essentially make something that's one part highly entertaining musical and another part educational and historical piece is wonderful.Negatives? I only really have one and it's sort've minor. There are a LOT of characters portrayed here and a lot of the actors play more than one role and it can be difficult at times to keep things straight. This is a fleeting issue, a few minutes after an actor steps into a new character and it's clear who they are, but there's that initial moment of 'Huh?' that can be briefly distracting. I get the feeling this is just a part of stage shows and I'm just the uncivilized dullard that doesn't know better but it is what it is.Now, as of me writing this, Hamilton is under fire and on the ever-growing cancel list. I don't agree with that. No, it doesn't focus on all of his faults, but Hamilton definitely doesn't portray Alexander as a saint by any means, not in my eyes. I think this absolutely worth watching and forming your own opinion on. Do the actions of the real man that died in 1804 mean that a 2020 musical can't be enjoyed? Can we judge the past with modern sensibilities? These are the deep, philosophical issues that this can bring out and I think these are discussions worth having. Personally, I separate the art from the inspiration and found this to be wildly entertaining. If you don't believe you are able or willing to do that, then your experience may vary wildly and that is perfectly alright by me."
Hamilton,10-Jul-20,"Hamilton is a fantastic modern musical of which there was no hype about it in the UK - not that I noticed anyway.
It was something advertised on Disney + that I just decided to watch due to having time to kill because of the COVID-19 quarantine! ...but WOW. I was blown away, I'm English & knew nothing of American history (I do now).
I never knew who Hamilton was, so I went into this rather blindly and naively. This show somehow manages to do what other stage productions have not successfully achieved; make that leap to a film and be incredible, breathtaking and executed impeccably.
I was delighted by the modern rap, the casting, the jazz, the virtuosity of the actors, the rap battle (what a giggle in itself) the close up expressions (which you miss in a theatre & greatly enhanced by the expertise of the performers), the stage choreography & the humour. American humour doesn't usually bring a smile to my face, let alone make me laugh. Hamilton however, managed to break this pattern and had me giggling out loud all by myself.
Being English I had to write a review to let other Brits know how fantastic this film/show is & how it will entertain them too. Don't pass this up just cause you think it's going to be some boring US history stage show that won't quite make it, cause this is anything but that!
I never rate anything 10. Although I rated this 9/10, I must admit, I did deliberate scoring my first 10 over this show.
I recommend you watch this, you won't be disappointed. It's quite unlike anything I've seen before. Thoroughly entertained from start to finish. In fact it was so splendid, nothing I watch in the near future will come close to satisfying me half as much as Hamilton managed to achieve. Plus I learnt something through osmosis- :-)"
Hamilton,04-Jul-20,"I had always loved to listen to Hamilton with my family in long car rides and around the house, but seeing it was a whole new level of enjoyment.The Cinematography and the Choreography were what really made the show fantastic for me. I loved how many of the extras did the parts of stage crew within the dancing they had in specific songs.The entire play was authentic and original. The singing was not auto-tuned as so much of the music is today.Throughout this play/movie a wide range of emotions were conveyed as well. There was humor (especially with the King George songs), sadness (largely at the end of the showing) and triumph (winning the battle of Yorktown).The writing was genius in which the introductory melody was used with different words throughout the play, as well. The finale had a similar thing where many of the songs played a part and many different words were reused in a genius way. I loved this and would watch it again. I am sad that due to coronavirus this musical is not still being performed live, but would like to see it when possible.9.3/10 :)"
Hamilton,04-Jul-20,Never believe the hype. I didn't believe it. For years I had heard so much about a play about of all people Alexander Hamilton-but done to rap or something similar? Can't be good and maybe offensive. But then the noise of its greatness never quieted. So when it finally came to my town I had to see it. But first I listened to the soundtrack. I was hooked. Despite mezzanine seating I was floored how good the play was. I repeated the soundtrack. Day after day and the message became clearer. News of a movie but then a live taping with the original cast. I couldn't wait. Up close made all the lyrics more amazing. The story was better than I recalled. Outstanding performances. I truly loved it.
Hamilton,06-Jul-20,A common critique of Hamilton has been that it's a disgraceful attempt to rewrite our history and romanticize our founding fathers as many of them were slaveowners. This article seeks to address this critique. Did Disney release this movie ahead of its original release date to address the divides in our country? Could Miranda actually be illustrating that America and our country is an unfinished symphony?
Hamilton,04-Jul-20,"Yes, I was one of the poor folk who couldn't afford to see it in person... but to see the original cast in #hamilfilm is probably even better!! SO much talent represented here, but what struck me the most was Lin-Manuel's range of expression. What a talented human being."

Hamilton,04-Jul-20,"I was fortunate enough to see Hamilton 3 times in Chicago, including once from the second row thanks to a friend winning the lottery. How did this compare? WAY better than I expected, honestly. I noticed new moments. I saw the original cast in a new light. I experienced the story like I was onstage. There's nothing quite like being in the theater, but this may be the closest a film crew ever got to capturing theater magic. (I wish the RENT movie had been a recording of a 1996 production...) Hamilton represents a unique moment in American theatre, and I'm grateful someone captured it."
Hamilton,03-Jul-20,"The time has come. The lights go down. King George III welcomes us to the show. Hamilton has finally arrived in a beautiful HD presentation! You've heard of it, you've listened to it more times than you can count, you've bopped to it and belted the words on your friend's aux to their absolute shock/confusion. Now we can FINALLY enjoy it on loop over and over again on a non bootleg copy, that's right NO MORE SLIME
TUTORIALS! Considering it's called a ""Hamilton film I would say it's right in my ballpark don't you?? First of all, the show is amazing. It's among the best the stage has to offer in the modern age. The music, the performances, the writing, the production, it's all BEAUTIFUL, if you haven't seen it yet WATCH IT NOW, but what truly makes it SO good? In the words of Lin Manuel Miranda, ""It's a story about America then, as told by America now."" The Founding Fathers are played by actors of color, among other characters featured in the story. The show is having us leave whatever cultural baggage we have about these historical figures at the door, and embracing this story through the eyes of America NOW. Yes it does leave some factors out, yes it's not all historically accurate, but people need to realize the point isn't to tell an IN DEPTH biographical story of Hamilton, but rather show us how his life and the events that he took part in helped form the foundations and ideals of what this country was built upon. This show is very Patriotic but it reminds me of what America is SUPPOSE TO BE. WHAT IT COULD BE. Much like the young people of my generation going out and marching for the racial injustices in this country, Hamilton was a 20 year old immigrant that fought for the freedom of this land and helped shaped the principles in which we aspire to uphold. This show isn't going to acknowledge our systemic racism roots with people like Washington and Jefferson who factually owned slaves, but it challenges us to contemplate our OWN feelings about this country and where we came from. How far have we come? What has changed and what could WE do better? Could our founding fathers have done more to abolish slavery? Absolutely, but think about what they did try to create and lay the foundations for. Who knows what they could've done if they had more time? It's not meant to idolize these people, it's a piece about the birth of America, and what people like Hamilton did to help a struggling new country find its own identity. When I watch/listen to this show, I believe in that. I believe that America WAS already great, we just lost sight of it and let the wrong people get in charge. If you want to know why, watch Hamilton. The story of an immigrant that fought in a war, and made a name for himself in a ludicrous political game, is a story that will be remembered for generations. Miranda and his team found an incredible medium to tell these people's stories, and that's what it's all about, who tells our story? How will we be remembered? Hamilton's now available on Disney+, I highly suggest you watch it for your 4th of July this weekend and many days after... But as a final reminder don't forget, this is at its heart, live theatre. Hopefully when Covid ends we can actually experience it all together the way we're suppose to, in front of the stage, LIVE. But for now, this will of course do! 10/10."
Hamilton,07-Jul-20,"I really do enjoy the Hamilton soundtrack and was so excited to actually view the performance! However, in a sense, I do think I have listened to the soundtrack too much to the point where I 'know' what happens too well. For watching the musical, I recommend not over-saturating oneself with other Hamilton media.All in all, it is an excellent musical with brilliant writing, excellent performances, and a memorable, multi-layered, story."
Hamilton,07-Jul-20,"Like the rest of the world, I watched ""Hamilton"" on Disney Plus this weekend. Though I have seen a number of stage musicals, I haven't seen ""Hamilton"" yet, so this was my first opportunity to see the highly regarded show and I have to say that it didn't disappoint.Alexander Hamilton (Lin-Manuel Miranda) rises up from extremely humble beginnings to play a key role in the American War of Independence. His life sees him befriend, and then rival, Aaron Burr (Lesile Odom Jr) as both a military leader and then a statesman in the burgeoning country. He marries Eliza Schuyler (Phillipa Soo) but his infidelity proves to be the undoing of his reputation and the end of his progress.So I want to consider the show and the production separately, to give a fair appraisal.First the show. I really enjoyed it. I've always harboured concerns that the style of music might be too much of a deviation from established musicals, but really it isn't. I initially didn't think that any of the songs were as instantly memorable as some other musicals, but in fairness I've been humming bits from several of them since. The first half of the show focuses on his military career and the second as he serves under George Washington establishing financial systems and his family life. My only issue with the show was that several actors play two roles on either side of the interval and I wasn't totally clear that they had changed. There's no one actor that I could single out for special praise, because frankly, everyone is fantastic and it's gratifying to see so many of these particular cast taking Broadway and Hollywood roles.The production is great though. Single stage setting, with two turntables in the middle helping to keep things dynamic. There's a wide establishing shot, from a production with an audience present, that the reactions are taken from. This is cut with a series of closer shots from an onstage camera that must come from a series of audience free runs, which provide another level of depth and intimacy that is otherwise impossible. It's honestly the way that all stage performances need to be shot from now on.No recording is ever going to capture what it's like to see a show live, with a reacting audience but this is as close as we're likely to get and it's wonderful that this particular version has been memorialised forever."
Hamilton,05-Jul-20,So thankful that there is a version of the beloved musical that is easily accessible to those who haven't seen it live.
Hamilton,05-Jul-20,"I had the good fortune to see Hamilton in person during its 1st tour and as amazing as that was, I find this filmed performance to be possibly better. My seats were up in the back, and it's absolutely wonderful to be able to see the expressions on the actors faces, the dynamics of the choreography a bit better and to watch it with the subtitles on so that every terrific bit of lyric can be enjoyed.And, yes, I had to add the above side note in the title to my review, because there is false information going around that Hamilton owned slaves. He was opposed to slavery and should certainly be faulted for not doing more to prevent it, but no, he didn't own slaves:"
Hamilton,04-Jul-20,"This 2016 movie of the stage show is excellent for a lot of reasons. The cast has a lot to do with that. Every cast member makes their role real and memorable. They do it smoothly. They earn the massive applause they receive for each number. It's easy to see why.This filming of a Broadway Stage show has been done in movie history, but only a few times as effectively. If you go back to silent films, ironically since Disney is producing this, the 1925 silent of Peter Pan (before Disney animated it) was really a film of the broad way stage show of Peter Pan. If you have never seen it, and can tolerate a silent film, you'd be surprised how effective that silent is filming the stage show.The cast pulls out all the stops here and the orchestra is heard but not seen doing excellent score music from the pit. Manuel's story from the real history is well done, and the songs and dancing fits perfectly. As for the politics, yes this show has ""Quid Pro Quo"" in it in 2016, way before it became a famous quote on the news before the Corona Virus. There's another issue mentioned here when on character states that America can't be expected to help every country in conflict in the world. We are really proving that now, so in 2016 while this was addressing Obama's foreign policy, regime change, now it is current because our US media is actively trying to change regimes in the world. The internet has made US media drunk with power, and it's not always for the good.I will say one thing is incomplete here. They mention some of the amazing stuff Hamilton's wife did after he died, but her story needs to be done someplace. She lived 50 years after her husband and did things many women should be proud of.Now as far as Slavery not getting a lot of attention, no story of history can be perfect. In fact, the longest serving slaves in US History are Women. Women could not vote until the 20th Century and it was the 1960's before they were no longer expected to stay home, not work, and be at the mercy of their husbands. Women are smarter though because instead of asking for pity and reparations, they have worked inside the system to improve it and we might be on the verge of a Black Woman Vice-President. (Possibly President as well) It's way over due.History has already been written and no amount of revision or destruction can change history. The fact is we need to look back at history and realize that ""The Future Matters."" If we fail to do this, we owe women more than we owe anyone else because of the past. I hope someone does a sequel to this and tells the whole story of Mrs. Hamilton. We owe her that."
Dil Bechara,24-Jul-20,One of the finest acting I've ever seen.I suggest you to please watch this. I think this is far better than movies originated from nepotism. Shushant Sir has done great work and lived the moment in this film. Everything was perfect.
Dil Bechara,24-Jul-20,This is the only Indian movie which made me cry..... You need to be emotionally strong specially after the dismissal of the Sushant Singh Rajput.. he is great and he was capable to be no 1 in india.. Because of nepotism we lost a well deserved star. I was deeply upset by the ending but overall it was a great movie
Dil Bechara,24-Jul-20,"Dear Manny/Augustas/Sushant Singh Rajput
you did leave a mark, you left all your viewers speechless.
Be it in the reel world or the real world.
You were the most amazing character and I enjoyed you act, and sobbed at the same time, watching you smile and crack jokes made me so emotional.
How could a person this cheerful with the brightest not with us anymore.
This movie was very warm just the right mix of humor and drama and emotions.
Its so fresh that one can re-watch it a 100 times and still wont get bored.
I recommend it to all the people out their, because it is not just about cancer or just the regular teenage love story, it far more than that.
Give it a watch and I'm sure you'll agree with me."
Dil Bechara,24-Jul-20,This movie made me cry so so much I don't remember when was the last time I cried so much. Seriously life is so unpedictable live your life to fullest and enjoy this movie with your friends and family. Take care of your loved ones. Seriously what a fantastic movie. Lots of love Sushant you will be missed so so much.
Dil Bechara,24-Jul-20,There is no better way to give tribute to a genuinely amazing actor. The film was pretty emotional and touching. Such natural acting from #Sushanth and #SanjanaSanghi and a brilliant execution from other the cast and crew. The movie indeed had plot holes and rushed up situations but I don't think anyone will notice those stuffs as the movie maintained a emotionally touching storyline and knowing the fact that Sushanth left us made it way more emotional and can't finish the movie without releasing a single drop of tear.
Dil Bechara,24-Jul-20,"Again a brilliant performance by Sushant Singh Rajput.We will miss him, will miss his art.
Brilliant performance by all the cast, it felt real.
Great movie!"
Dil Bechara,24-Jul-20,Sushant will live on forever in our hearts! Its just sad that we never appreciated him enough while he was alive! Loved the movie!
Dil Bechara,24-Jul-20,"I'm not writing this from an emotional side of mine.. but I've rated 10/10 for this film only because of Sushant's acting..the way he conveyed each n every emotion, be it with his eyes/body language..speechless..simply marvellous!!Such a huge loss for the industry!! Rest of d casts were average I'd say!!"
Dil Bechara,24-Jul-20,"Its life
The one who want to live they die
And the one whom can live they choose to not....."
Dil Bechara,24-Jul-20,After watching the movie. I could only say it touched the heart and emotions in the movie make us learn many things in life. I would only say there are some movies which are actually meant to be kept forever in our collection.. this movie is one of those.. Best of 2020.
Dil Bechara,24-Jul-20,"A must watch movie... This movie will tell you what lies between birth and death is life that we generally forget to live... Live your life to the fullest..you never know what will gonna happen next 💔 Amazing performance by Sushant, Sanjana,"
Dil Bechara,24-Jul-20,Don't know what to write just after the watching the movie but watch this without even a second thought. Love SSR!
Dil Bechara,24-Jul-20,The best movie and I was in my tears while watching and all I was looking at Sushant Singh Rajput. He brings life to each frame and loved his work. Simply magical.
Dil Bechara,24-Jul-20,"This is the best adaptation of The Fault in Our Stars, the book. Both the Hollywood adaptation and this one made changes and are not word for word. But the story, intent and screenplay in this one tops any other adaptation that I have seen, including the plays."
Dil Bechara,24-Jul-20,"A must watch movie... This movie will tell you what lies between birth and death is life that we generally forget to live... Live your life to the fullest..you never know what will gonna happen next 💔 Amazing performance by Sushant, Sanjana, Swastika etc 👍👍"
Dil Bechara,24-Jul-20,"Really just would bring tears into your eyes, this story depicts an amazing and a truly Lovely Story of Kizi Basu and Immanuel Rajkumar Jr. !"
Dil Bechara,24-Jul-20,The story of the movie we all know. I have watched this movie only for SSR. It's his EVERGREEN last movie. He will be with us & will be FOREVER In our Heart. Love You SSR. YOU ARE A REAL ACTOR.
Dil Bechara,24-Jul-20,"Hard to think Sushant is gone. But he leaves behind another epic film!You can't take your eyes off him, the movie is amazing. It's easy breezy.I think it's going to be hard to get into the technical details of the totality of the film but what's exceptionally clear is that you've got to Watch it for Sushant... he was made for the movies...He knows his craft, you can sense his powerful presence in every scene, and that's the true mark of an efficient actor. The beauty is in the details - from getting the walk of the character right to setting the mood right, Sushant steals the show."
Dil Bechara,24-Jul-20,"If you had seen The orginal good for you. Now you know this one is better than that. I am not sayin this because it's Sushant last venture. When I heard that they are going to make the remake of 'The fault in Our Stars'. I thought they are going to ruin this.
But Mukesh Chabra proved me wrong. Shushant is the best Manny you can ever get.
And then There is A.R. Rehman sir with his music nothing can get wrong."
Dil Bechara,24-Jul-20,The movie was absolutely fantastic. After so long I have cried while watching a movie. The conversation between kizie's dad and Manny was really emotional.
Dil Bechara,24-Jul-20,"Fantastic movie, watched this movie for one and only sushant singh rajput the true and real actor"
Dil Bechara,24-Jul-20,"Heart wrenching movie unbaisedly, Absolutely roller coaster of emotions..We have lost a superstar.. shame on bollywood mafia nexus."
Dil Bechara,24-Jul-20,To fell the pain and happiness at the same time Mr. Junior show us the exact way to how to handle it appropriately.
Dil Bechara,24-Jul-20,"I Smiled, Laughed, Loved and I Cried, Cried and Cried... Kizzie Basu the most lovely character well portrayed by the actress.. Swastika Ma'am you are always beautiful. SSR From Pavitra Rishta to Jhalak Dhikla Jaa to Kaipoche to MS Dhoni to Chichhore to Dil Bechara"
Dil Bechara,24-Jul-20,"A nice lovely setting and story line up.. Sushant singh Rajput was a natural..Mr Chabra thank you for making his last movie..loved both Sushant and Sanjana in the movie..
Pls watch it subtitles..."
365 Days,15-Jun-20,I honestly can't believe this is an actual movie and number 1 on Netflix in my country.
365 Days,15-Jun-20,"This was probably the worst movie I've ever seen.
The dialogues between the main characters are unbelievably cringy and the plot literally doesn't make any sense. Don't watch this movie unless you wanna waste 2 hours of your life just to give this movie a (probably) 1 star rating too."
365 Days,07-Jun-20,"Girl's boyfriend wears cargo short pants on her birthday. If that is not a red flag, I do not know what it is."
365 Days,30-Apr-20,The cringe levels runeth over. The English is almost as bad as the plot. If you want to watch this movie do so as a drinking game. Did you cringe? Then take a shot my dude. You will be wasted by the end.
365 Days,15-Jun-20,A kidnapped woman is smiling less than 24 hours after being fed and taking shopping at a high end botique by her captor. 3 days into her captivity spent jetsetting to VIP clubs and on private yachts she blows him and falls in love. A true romance tale for the ages.
365 Days,16-Jun-20,"I honestly don't know who thought that this movie would be a good idea. It is a complete train wreck for multiple reasons.One of the biggest issues is the plot is just nonsense. It is inappropriate to have a man deiced that he will hold a woman captive and she will love him. That is just not ok and i don't know why they made a movie romanticising this idea. The male character is a creep. He assaults the female character multiple times and it is not shown as a bad thing. It's just like he is a man and he has power so he can do what he likes. It is really really bad. Beyond that they just do variations of the same scene 6 different times. This movie is just the same scene over and over again broken up with random montages with a song played over it.The actions of the characters are nonsensical too. She has been kidnapped in a foreign country and then the next day there is a shopping montage where she is just like ""woo lets go buy some new clothes"". Like that just wouldn't happen, you would be terrified and she just acts like fine with it. I feel like they try to get the audience on side by making her current boyfriend a horrible person. I think they think the audience will be like ""oh that's good she got away from him"". Yeah she did get away from her bad boyfriend...by being kidnapped by an Italian mobster who is holding her captive????The second issue is the leads can't act and a lot of the movie is just them interacting so its like watching an amateur dramatics troupe half of the time. Now i can't work this out but this woman who is kidnapped never seems scared like at all. I can't deiced if this was the direction she was given or she just can't act or the script said she isn't scared. She literally wakes up after being kidnapped and tried to open the door to get out, can't because its locked and is just like ""Yeah fair enough"" and just sits down like this happens every day.On top of that the scenes with the male lead pushing her against walls and stuff she pulls like ""Posing, modelling"" faces and is not like ""Jesus Christ the man is assaulting me help"". Once again was this the direction or was it the acting who's knows?It also relies heavily on ""Pop"" songs that are really loud and unnecessary. They constantly play one after the other and then when reading i found out the male lead sung like a big chunk of them so i guess production was just like ""well he will give us them cheep let's throw them all in"".I could go one about all its problems but it all circles back to the directing, acting and the script. It was just a perfect storm.Believe it or not it is watchable but in a way that you want to watch it to see the disaster. It is the no1 viewed film on a large amount of different countries Netflix's at the moment and i believe this to be the reason.So its really up to you if you want to watch it. It is very boring but also a train wreck."
365 Days,15-Jun-20,"I do not even know where to start. Look, this is nothing but straight up porn. The plot is ridiculous, the chemistry between the two leads is nonexistent, and the acting is even worse. Trust me when I say, you will watch this in fast forward. It is that horrible!"
365 Days,08-Apr-20,"I don't remember if I have reviewed another movie so far, but seeing so many 10/10 reviews determined me to log in to write this, to ballance things up a bit.The movie is pretty bad. The plot (if you can call it that) is mostly absurd and the events are cliche and totally predictable (try to remember what somebody did or said in all the bad movies that you ever saw: yes, it's exactly what's going to happen), the events don't make a lot of sense, the dialogue is cringe, the characters are very cartoonish and unbelievable. What they say don't make a lot of sense, and also nobody reacts to events in the way a normal person would do. These are comic book characters, not people. When they try to suggest some of these people are crime lords it's hilarious, you can't help but chuckle. Real mobsters would have these guys for breakfast. Ironically, the fly girls in the movie are actually more believable, because the way they live it is more close to some girls I know.I never saw any of the ""Shades of Gray"" movies, but for a good part it felt like a relative of those movies. The sex scenes are pretty convincing, I'm still unsure if the oral sex was actually simulated or not.The good things I can say about this are (and each gets a star from me):
the photography is pretty good, at least the cinematographer knew what he was doingthe actors are generally pretty easy on the eye, the costumes are also solid, there are nice and diverse locations, hence there is always something appealing to look at on the screenthe sex scenes are pretty good if you're into that kind of thing (I am)Should you see it? Well I don't know, even with the low score that I gave it, I feel like people should make up their own mind and not take someone's else opinion on it. Besides, I think people should watch bad movies from time to time, to be able to understand better why other movies are good, and to be more appreciative of those, as a consequence.So yeah, go watch it, but keep your expectations ridiculously low."
365 Days,07-Jul-20,"What do 50 shades of grey and twighlight have in common. The lure of the bad rich handsome bad boy. I'd say this movie took it too another level, because instead of just seducing her he literally kidnaps her, handcuffs her, and forces her to fall in love. Stockholm syndrome taken to the next level. The crazy thing is that this is still a chick flick and frankly I was a bit bored. It was a relief that the end was so abrupt because the story really didn't seem to have anywhere to go. The only reason I made it that far is because girl is attractive."
365 Days,09-Jun-20,"I have read a few stories on the app and this movie is definitely a good reason why some books should never make it on the screen.
It was fun but ridiculous and pathetic."
365 Days,08-Jun-20,"Such stupid, worthless, toxic story line . Glorification of relationships where the sole role of a woman is to be a slave and fulfill the desires of a harsh , egotistic ,rich male character."
365 Days,14-Jun-20,"365 days is about a successful but unhappy young woman whose path crosses with that of a young, handsome mafia boss. He kidnaps her and gives her a deadline of one year to fall in love with him. Despite the rough introduction, she eventually gives in to his charms and falls in love with him. The central core of the movie is domination, or how the male protagonist uses his raw masculinity to completely overwhelm the girl until she eventually gives in to her lust, so, this movie is a very obvious copycat of 50 Shades of Grey.Now, this movie isn't exactly bad. It's not good either, mind you, but once you understand why it was made in the first place, you can at least understand its motivation. There are two ways of looking at this film:1. You try to look at this movie at a normal light, and you immediately notice one thing: it draws a lot of inspiration from 50 Shades of Grey, but it adds a completely ludicrous kidnapping scenario. It's like if 50 Shades collided at very high speeds with Beauty and the Beast, then someone filmed the tragic, messy aftermath and sold it as a movie. The first act seems pretty straightforward: the young girl is deeply frustrated with her love life and is set to meet the handsome, assertive gangster. But how the meeting goes is where the craziness starts: he intentionally snatches her off the street and holds her captive. Then tells her he will only let her go if she manages to not fall in love with him in one year. This already feels like a plot picked straight from a Law and Order: SVU episode. The explanation he gives for why he went after her in the first place just adds another thick layer of insanity to the bananas cake. The events that follow are so astoundingly bizarre that they boggle the mind. It doesn't take too long for her to accept her predicament, and after what appears to be no more than a day, she is already playing flirty games and teasing him. Once she gets her cell phone and her laptop back, she never bothers to, say, call the police, or tell her family what's going on. For half of the movie, she acts more like a girl just teasing and trying make her crush jealous, than like a woman who has just being abducted for sexual purposes by a deranged murderer. In any other context, seeing her giving in, sleeping with him and start a relationship with her kidnapper would be a horrific story of a poor woman being forced against her will and, after getting completely broken inside, accepting her fate. Seeing her mistake her inevitable Stockholm Syndrome for truly falling in love is not only tragic, it almost insults the intelligence of the viewer. The ending doesn't help either, because it tries to be somber and serious, but by the time the film ends, those two words have already flown through the window long ago. This movie seems even more baffling and out of place in our current times, the era of the fight for gender equality, the struggle for greater respect for women and the MeToo movement.I know you are thinking this is incomprehensible and bizarre. I sure thought that way myself for the first half. But then you realize you are simply looking at it wrong. This is still no Citizen Kane, mind you, but it has a very simple reason to exist.2. This movie is a complete fantasy. The female lead is in an extremely relatable situation: she has a vaguely defined but supposedly successful job, but her love life is a mess. Her deadbeat boyfriend is an amalgamation of many things that are collectively considered very bad traits for a male partner: lazy, makes tasteless jokes about her in front of their friends, doesn't pay attention to her feelings and needs and, (shocking), leaves her behind on her birthday, to go see a place they had previously agreed to go to together. He also seems very indifferent to her sexual desires, and this is the crucial part I'll get to shortly. So far, very generic romantic movie stuff. The next step we the audience expect is for a knight in shiny armor to appear and save her from the dead relationship, but this is where the normal movie stuff ends: her savior just outright kidnaps and threatens her. He takes her to his house and doesn't allow her to leave. This dangerous criminal turns out to be an extremely dominating man. He grabs her violently, thrashes her around and menacingly states that she will cave in to him. He also turns out to be very rich. He lives in a gigantic castle. He takes her to shop for expensive clothes in luxurious stores, gives her refined dinners and procures any dish she desires. He is also tall, muscular, with a gruff beard and a generous amount of chest hair. Even when she tries to tease him and gain the upper hand, he turns the tables and subdues her. He is, by and large, the textbook definition of an alpha male. When she tries to make him feel jealous by dancing with another man in a nightclub, our hero responds by shooting the offender in the hands, and frowning at her until she apologizes. And when they finally make love, it is implied that it was everything she ever hoped for - he makes her feel like a Woman, dammit. This is the moment when something clicks in your mind. This movie takes a lot of influences from 50 Shades, but they didn't come from nowhere. Let's get a little dirty here. How many of us here have played, or heard about someone who plays, fetishes and fantasies with their SOs, and how many of those fantasies usually include popular, silly scenarios like the boyfriend/husband roleplaying as a police officer, catching the bandit played by the wife/girlfriend, and taking her into custody for ""interrogation and full body search""? Then it hits you. This movie doesn't make logical sense because it doesn't have to. It's just two hours of a bland, female lead who's a stand in for the woman watching the movie, and living the fantastic, outlandish fantasy that I suppose many girls and women out there enjoy thinking about: being seduced and dominated by an otherwordly alpha male who then vigorously sates their sexual desires. This movie just uses a ""girl gets kidnapped"" scenario, 50 Shades simply went the more niche route with BDSM. Simple, nonsensical plots that serve purely to let the female viewers vicariously live a sexual fantasy.I'm going to say it out loud: this is a porn movie. It's a porno made for women. And there is absolutely nothing wrong with this. This is nothing more than a pure, sexual guilty pleasure that obviously would never work in the real world. Nothing different from a ""traditional"" porn movie. The only real difference is the public it is aimed at. A normal porn movie for men is going to cater to men's fantasies: ludicrous setups, gorgeous women gladly doing everything the man demands, explicit images of intercourse. This porn movie (and 50 Shades as well) caters to fantasies that are more common for many women: a strong, dominating male figure that takes them on expensive trips to majestic locations and is completely focused on pleasuring the woman, not himself. The only thing this movie really does wrong at this point is being marketed as a normal, traditional movie when it so clearly is not. If you are a woman, you are probably going to enjoy living this fantasy, and there is no shame in that. It just makes me realize how grossly biased the movie industry is when it comes to porn: we are okay with all the millions of silly porno flicks and videos aimed at men, but when we see a silly sexual fetish movie aimed at women, the moviegoing public collectively pops their monocles in outrage.I watched this movie with my wife and while we were trying to take it seriously, we both complained how bizarre the plot is. But once we understand what is actually at play here, we see it in a whole different light. This is a porn movie, and don't let the lack of explicit imagery fool you (there is lots of nudity however, so beware). If you are still not convinced and will still watch it thinking it is a ""traditional"" movie, don't bother, and save the disappointment. If, however, you understand and accept it for what it is, then go ahead at enjoy it."
365 Days,14-Jul-20,"What I have to say, don't know. I didn't find any plot or story yet it was engaging."
365 Days,02-Apr-20,"Seriously, I am not a politically correct, ""woke"" or outraged person.But the idea that a scumbag mafia guy, is going to sexually assault his way into a woman's heart is not just absurd, but simply disgusting.Think Christopher Moltisante's ""Cleaver"" script within Sopranos with no dramatic irony. My guess is this film was financed by mafioso types. Exactly what attributes does this mafia leader have? He has brutishness, but he has no cunning, no leadership skills, and is not credible as someone who would rise through the ranks in anything, including organized crime.
He is about as sexy as a toad.The acting, dialogue, plot and cinematography are just amazingly bad and cringe-worthy. The makers of this spent more time shilling the review section here than they did writing this junk."
365 Days,04-Jul-20,"Laura is a young, upwardly mobile sales professional finally ready to invest in herself and settle down - but first there is a planned trip. But when the plans fall through, she is forced to keep a man's dream alive first - even if it means keeping her boyfriend and her immediate future at bay. What i liked is she is open-minded and can be persuaded.
But will she remain persuaded? You have to watch to know."
365 Days,13-Jul-20,"I liked it. I enjoyed it. What's not to like? He loves me, gives me pleasure, gives me money, a boat and lets me go shopping. Good movie and allowed me to fantasize.
And I have a choice.
And I can have a baby too.What I don't like then? Actually, Massimo. Do not like his face and the beard has to go.
Also, the music. Why was it so disconnected to the plot and so loud. I could not hear them talk or make love!"
365 Days,08-Jun-20,Probably one of the worst movies of the century so far
365 Days,05-Jul-20,"Man. This was definitely NOT a 1 star movie, in fact, it wasn't half as bad as I was expecting it to be.Glitz, glamor, mafia, sex, pop music, murders, sexual dynamics, and high livin'. The only downer for me was the constant insertion of those crazy pop songs in nearly every scene. If I want to watch music videos I can go to Youtube for that. Can't people write scores with strings and pianos anymore?Also, I'm not prude, but the love scenes between the lead characters were veering into pornhub territory as they went on and on and on..and, of course, with the crap singing music in the background.Very sad ending. I thought it would be Massimo dying in the gang war, but instead, it was Laura at her happiest. Pregnant, anxious, and planning her wedding--with her best friend in town. Please, next time, leave the constant music with a show like ELITE, it works better there."
365 Days,20-Feb-20,"Laura is an attractive, ball-busting Polish hotel executive who fights her corner in board meetings then goes home to her slobbish partner and collection of dildos. Massimo is a gangster - but the young, sexy kind: he's described as having ""a body sculpted by God... and a dick sculpted by the devil"" (which is a pretty erotic line until the viewer unwillingly starts picturing said protuberance with horns and a little pointy beard). Having caught a fleeting glimpse of Laura some years before and been obsessed with her ever since, Massimo is delighted to discover she is holidaying on his native Sicily. He promptly kidnaps her and tells her he will hold her for 365 days while attempting to make her fall in love with him.Personally, I would have thought not kidnapping her in the first place would have been ample proof of his honourable intentions - as would not promising he will not touch without her permission whilst nonetheless pinning her to a chair and grabbing her tit. But then this film - based on a novel - is hardly politically correct. The main problem, of course, is Laura's ultimate falling in love with Massimo (c'mon, you knew she would!): although she is allowed a scene of berating herself for so doing, there is no effort to examine whether she is suffering from, for example, some form of Stockholm Syndrome - although that would have made this a far deeper film.Other flaws are the many dangling plot-threads: for instance, Laura's weak heart is mentioned several times but nothing is ever done with it. When she is offered a job as ""general manager of Preston"" (presumably not the football club) we have to guess that she turns it down; and when Massimo is told ""they"" want to kill his sweetheart we are not told who ""they"" are, despite the fact the preceding scenes have identified at least two likely candidates. On the plus side, one plot-thread that I thought it a wise decision to leave dangling was the final scene involving a tunnel: we know the outcome of what happened in there, but we are not told exactly *how* it happened, which adds a pleasing air of mystery.As for the acting, leads Anna Maria Sieklucka and Michele Morrone deserve credit for delivering much of their dialogue in English, which is presumably their second (at best) language: this does mean, however, that some of their lines sound a bit clunky to those for whom English is mother tongue. As often in this kind of production, the supporting characters - not encumbered with the requirement to be romantic heroes - are more interesting: there are fine comedic turns from Magdalena Lamparska as Laura's exuberant friend Olga, and from Otar Saralidze as a bemused young gangster.This film is, I imagine, an attempt to create a Polish version of 'Fifty Shades of Grey'. It does not match the latter's theme of women's empowerment (for all the whips and chains, Anastasia is in control in a way kidnap victim Laura certainly is not), but - with apologies for shallowness - there is more nudity and sex in '365 Dni'. But it *is* similar to 'Fifty Shades' in the attractiveness not only of its cast, but also of its locations and clothes (there are several shopping scenes); and as a piece of escapist entertainment it certainly hits the spot."
365 Days,03-Jul-20,"And so does Laura! Ask her... she wants more by the movie's end.A caring boyfriend trying to win a girl's heart after an unfortunate series of mishaps for her and her loser boyfriend. The director has chosen the right characters to fulfill the roles and writers have done a well satisfying job in writing. You won't get bored even for a single minute and if you're a romantic lover, you'll love this movie. The dialogues are really romantic and attractive that you will not be able to blink for a moment. The ending also satisfying and unexpected.Other good films if you liked this one: in The Realm Of Senses, The Vow, Lost In Beijing and of course Fifty Shades Of Grey."
365 Days,06-Jul-20,"Outraged woke people will obviously 1 star this movie.The guy is a brute, and the girl acts strong, but loves that hes a brute.People complain about the English... the English is fine if youre from Europe. Woke people angry its not directed at their country. Surprise!Its a chick flick full of girls partying with no consequences, drink, spa, drink, dancing, drink all while someone else pays for it. Seems accurate.On top of that, there is a lot of sex in the movie. Very 50 shades sex, but naked bodies on screen so guys wont immediately turn off how the irresponsible, party girl movie.Was it the worst? No, probably would have been pretty popular 10 years ago. Was it good? Meh, I was engaged through to the end, but no. It wasnt that good and the ending is very... oh, ok.Verdict, watch it once with your girlfriend/boyfriend. It will probably get you hot and heavy... unless youre woke and outraged at everything."
365 Days,07-Jun-20,Such a rip off from fifty shades of grey. The plot and character development is all over the place. Some things didn't make any sense at all. The ending was horrible. Where's my 2 hours gone?
365 Days,04-Jul-20,"Finally, beautiful woman on screen!Go into it with an open mind from this century not the 12th centuryHad fun and some good moments. Overall best of the recent movies."

Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga,28-Jun-20,"This is one of the very few times I have felt such emotions while watching a movie. Me and my gf cried a few times and laughed a lot. Many people ""not Icelanders"" criticise this movie saying that it's embarrassing for Icelanders and make us look stupid. Well to tell you the truth they got us in my mind pretty accurately. Made a frickin account just to write this. Thanks from iceland and have a good one."
Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga,26-Jun-20,Thank you Will Farell. We did not get a song contest this year but you gave us the best Eurovision I have ever seen! As an elf loving Icelanders I loved the silly humor and the end song brought me to tears. Rachel was adorable as ever.
Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga,28-Jun-20,"I had my doubts about this movie, but decided to watch it based on the cast. So glad I did. It made me smile, tap my foot and just escape a little to a happy place during a terrible time in the world.Is it the most deftly acted, written and produced movie...no, no Oscar nominations, I'm pretty sure. But that's not the point.What it does offer to the audience is a bit of fun and escapism, and a bunch of good laughs and cringe-worthy moments. It also left me a little lighter in spirit, and It reminded me to take the world less seriously. This was just what I needed during a pandemic, rampant racism, a horrible government and climate change out of control. There's so much that is wrong, that a little right is helpful. While I can't control the crazy world, I can control what I watch and how it impacts me. I choose to enjoy it for what it is and smile."
Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga,27-Jun-20,"That song will forever be stuck in my head. Well done everyone, very entertaining."
Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga,03-Jul-20,"Has Will Ferrell ever been anything but himself?
""I can't stand Will Ferrell""
So does every chocolate bar get a 1 star if you don't like chocolate?
This movie isn't a gripping drama. It's not edgy or groundbreaking.
It's cute, and it's fun.
It's definitely not for everyone. Expect some classic feel goods. Expect to immediately YouTube the main songs to hear them again. Expect Will Ferrell. Expect to fall in love with Rachell McAdams and silver lip gloss. Don't expect unforseeable twists.
It's ""hallmark"" meets ""pitch perfect"" meets ""elf"".Thanks Netflix and those who made this film for some feel goods in the middle of a globally not chipper time.
To you 1 star critics, take your negativity back to your comment threads and let us have a moment of Joy.Please and thank you"
Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga,26-Jun-20,"My expectations were low, I love Will Ferrel but his movies are often shallow and stupid and rarely touches you. This one is not deep and smart, that is not what I'm saying! But it is well made and has a lot of heart in it that balances the shallow and stupid quite good. Add on top of that the end performance by Rachel McAdams, the sweetest actress in all of Hollywood, and you suddenly find yourself cheering for a fictional Icelandic band in a fictional Eurovision contest in this feel good movie of crazy corona summer of 2020. Well done! Well done indeed!"
Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga,12-Jul-20,"Admit I'm not a Will Ferrell fan at all, his movies are all about him, but in this movie, Rachel Adams and Dan Stevens are a revelation of singing and comic talent. SO many great faces from the Eurovision Song Contest as well as cast members from the Witcher, The Norsemen etc. I realised by the time of the Eurovision party singalong that I was laughing out loud. The costumes, the dancing, are all insanely inspired. And as an Edinburgh native, thank you for filming here in Edinburgh! As I frequently direct Americans to the nearest Starbucks, thanks for the laugh out loud asides. Now time to put on my Icelandic elf slippers from my second favourite country in the world, and watch it again."
Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga,26-Jun-20,"I love Eurovision! I have no shame about this! Every year we have a get together with drinks and food and scoresheets and have the best night! This year everything changed, there was no get together, no singing our favourite songs, no voting and it was so so so missed!Tonight me and my sister thought let's give this a go, it will be a laugh. Well we were given Eurovision life! It was everything that we love about eurovision! The songs, the cheesiness, the love! Watch the film, enjoy it like a weekend of eurovision and don't take it seriously!The storyline is cute, its not forced it just flows and even if the length of the film feels long to you, you may not be a fan of eurovision (that show is long!!). I didn't want it to end and some of those songs are pure euro classics!! I have to say as a UK native we haven't won in a long long time so the only implausible part of the film is that it is in the UK and the hosts are not British but apart from that I will be watching this film anytime I feel sad as it has made my evening and made up the fact that eurovison was cancelled this year!Enjoy the film and don't take it seriously because Eurovision is just fun and meant to be enjoyed!!"
Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga,05-Jul-20,"Iceland is a small and isolated country in the middle of the Atlantic and we the Icelandic people have many traditions that may seem strange to other people.For this reason I find that we Icelanders are many times made fun of in pop culture. We eat shark that is nasty höhö. So tired of this guys seriously.This movie does not make fun of Iceland it pays tribute to Iceland. It uses many famous Icelandic actors and there are loads of small references to Icelandic things that only people how have been to Iceland would pick up on.A part from all that the movie is great. Will Ferrel is hilarious, Rachel McAdams is hilarious. The Jaja Ding dong guy is hilarious. Hearing Pierce Brosnan try and talk Icelandic is hilarious.10/10 No problem. Must watch!"
Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga,02-Jul-20,"I ignored the reviews online but my Missus wasn't so sure (as clearly had). Pleased to have watched this in a year so far that has hardly brought much laughter on the film front, plus given Eurovision was cancelled this year!Don't worry about the plot too much, and leave your negativities at the door, this is a laugh a minute along with some good acting from McAdams and Ferrell not always stealing the limelight with normal roles.Great humour and very entertaining! Pure Eurovision (ignore its in Edinburgh and the hosts aren't, plus Pierce Brosnans welsh...sorry, Icelandic accent)Recommend"
Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga,04-Jul-20,"I loved it! Because it hits a high sensible part about home, dreams and meaning of our actions.
And it's hilarious ! Thumbs up Will Ferrell !"
Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga,26-Jun-20,"I think when people see Will Ferrell on the casting list, they immediately think that it's going to be a laugh out loud movie, which I myself fell victim for. The film wasnt as funny as I had thought it would be, but instead found myself in tears at the end of the film. This is because this movie PERFECTLY represents what Eurovison is about, a proud cultural phenomenon that strives in diversity and community. This is a MUST SEE movie. The final song is beautiful, and the characters that are developed on screen become more lovable by the end of the film. There were also a few cameos too, of course there were going to be cameos! If you love Eurovision, you will fall in love with this!"
Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga,05-Jul-20,"This is worth watching just for Dan Stevens's portrayal of the Russian entrant, Alexander - brilliant acting and worthy of an award. Iceland's Final song is fantastic and I've already saved it in my Spotify playlist - another reason to watch the movie. One of the best lines in the movie for me was about elves taking things too far... had me & my friend in stitches."
Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga,02-Jul-20,"I'm an American who's been living in Europe for 15 years and had never heard of Eurovision before moving here. I now watch it each year and think it's hilariously kitschy, spectacular, and, every now and then, there's even a great song. This film brilliantly captures all of those elements of Eurovision in a film that's both extremely funny and moving. The song ""Husavik"" is genuinely great and there are some other fabulous musical moments as well, such as the ""songalong"". I suspect that most of the bad ratings come from Americans who've never seen Eurovision before and probably haven't ever been to the Nordic countries, so don't have a sense of what's funny about the characterizations of both. I don't say that with arrogance - I also didn't know before I moved here! In any case, I hope Americans will give this gem of a film a chance. It was clearly made with love and Will Ferrell took a risk making a film about a country he must have known most Americans have no interest in. Probably the most fun I've had watching a film this year, and I watch a lot. . ."
Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga,28-Jun-20,"I did not expect this. I ended up replaying the final song a million times. Awesome feel good movie. Watch it, you won't regret it.Edit: A million and 5 times. I'm a sucker for romance. This song wraps up the whole movie. Love how she is singing the song to Lars and finally tells him that he is her home and her home is wonderful. At the end she hits that speorg note which I think is the last 3 seconds of the last note. Meaning she sang from the heart. At the end, Lars finally ""sees"" Sigrit when they do their checking you out thing. There's a lot of meaningful things to dissect during this song. Love this movie."
Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga,05-Jul-20,"Fun film about Eurovision, love and elves. Laughed several times and loved the music, the former Eurovision winners cameos, and the elves. Dan Stevens was brilliant in this, ""he/him pronomen"" 😂.

Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga,27-Jun-20,"It's really good. My wife cried several times and I actually loved it. He's made so many turkeys taht this was what I expected.

Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga,03-Jul-20,"When I saw over two hours long for a comedy like this I was expecting to give up after 10 minutes but this came together surprisingly well, well put together, some unexpected laughs. The 2 hours actually flew by. You may have to love Eurovision, as I do, to really like it and 'get' parts of it. It also felt like a good Eurovision fix in a Eurovision- free year."

Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga,12-Jul-20,"This is one of Will Ferrells better comedies since Step Brothers. For me it goes number 5 behind Step Brothers, Talledega Nights, Anchorman, and Old School. And Rachel McAdams lights up the screen every she appears. A lot of funny moments including the magical elve joke and fun goofy music set pieces. Even my wife who isn't a Ferrell fan enjoyed this movie. Don't dismiss this film."
Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga,05-Jul-20,"I wasn't expecting much from this but was thoroughly overjoyed to be proved wrong.

Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga,02-Jul-20,"I worked on Eurovision for 20 years. Will Ferrell created a fantastic satire of this festival. He managed to capture the essence of Eurovision in this wonderful comedy. I laughed all the way. Thankyou Will for another witty, hilarious repasse."
The Kissing Booth 2,26-Jul-20,"Every teen movie sequel netflix has been chewing out somehow follows the same tropes. Introducing new guy we've never seen before (in TALBILB 2 it was John Ambrose) to shake things up. As the movie progresses the main female grows further apart from her boyfriend due to misunderstandings and what have you and grows closer to the 2nd love interest. They have undeniably chemistry and the movie makes you want to root for them instead of her and her boyfriend. They share a kiss and you think it's a done deal she obviously have feelings for John Ambrose/Marco but no. He's not the one she's in love with after all. The female protagonist realises her feelings in the end (cue running towards each other scene), clears up the misunderstandings and it's happy ever after all over again. The John Ambrose/Marco character's sole purpose is to sway her feelings and in the end make her realise her feelings for Peter/Noah are true and worth fighting for. The fact that Noah's on the film poster and not Marco made it clear from the start that Marco was never going to be the one for Elle. Sigh. I really liked him.What I did like was the friendship between Elle and Lee it's probably the best part of the movies."
The Kissing Booth 2,26-Jul-20,I basically predicted the entire movie after 10 Minutes.
The Kissing Booth 2,24-Jul-20,"This may be shocking for you, but I actually found the first movie of this franchise quite enjoyable. However, in the sequel, The Kissing Booth loses all of its quirky charms, which replaced by factors that makes a typical Netflix coming of age romance movie, cliche and predictable."
The Kissing Booth 2,24-Jul-20,"2 ⭐'sThe first one was cute because Joey and Jacob were in love on camera so the movie was kind of magical.This one was so bad. They were so awkward around each other, even 'by the phone', it was hard to watch. Their interaction were just too cringy and uncomfortable.The plot was meh. The love triangle or square was done horribly.The 2 ⭐'s were for Joey and Joel, they were awesome together. They should have gone to that direction aka best friends to lovers. It would have been much nicer."
The Kissing Booth 2,24-Jul-20,"The movie is what it's suppose to be. I wasn't disappointed by it. I had a good time while watching. Might feel a bit unreal, but it's a teenager movie and it's amusing and shows that sometimes people have a hard time communicate but in the end they manage to solve their issues by doing it. Think it was a bit better than the first, and the fact it add other people and stories in between, wasn't at all a problem to me, it was better that way. There was more to see, instead of just focusing on Lee, Elle and Noah.
I really think people shouldn't be bashing the movie over a bad line in it.
It wasn't their brightest moment, but don't think it was on purpose, people are just taking it way too serious. Nowadays everyone mocks with everything and do a lot worse, so I really don't think there is a reason to be bashing the movie this way."
The Kissing Booth 2,24-Jul-20,I was disappointed that marco and ellie didn't end up together. that's it
The Kissing Booth 2,24-Jul-20,"The script was terrible, it was a waste of time. I can't believe Netflix even decided to waste a penny on this movie. If you're planning on watching this don't. Acting is cringe and the main couple have no chemistry between the two of them. It's just awful all around."
The Kissing Booth 2,27-Jul-20,"This movie was just painful to watch at points, why did they have to make this movie? Lee's girlfriend is the worst character ever and Elle doesn't get with the hot Hispanic guy at the end. The best way to sum of this movie is 2 hours of pure pain."
The Kissing Booth 2,24-Jul-20,"But it's better than first. It's not as annoying. I still hate Elle Evans as a character though. The screenplay is bad and incredibly predictable. The main conflict is uninteresting. The gay subpolt is nice because it involves characters that aren't Elle, but they didn't really find a way to make it work so it felt really unnecessary. It was like Netflix's usual thing for including random gay characters just to prove that they're inclusive too guys. Also why does this movie have a Good Vibrations cover play at the end, that song is way too good for this trash."
The Kissing Booth 2,24-Jul-20,Very pleasantly surprised by how much I liked this movie more than the original! Usually that's not the case. But the acting felt more authentic and less cheesy in this one. Loved it! Very fun summer flick
The Kissing Booth 2,27-Jul-20,"Firstly why was this 2 hours long??? Secondly why was it that bad, but ended on such a cliff hanger??My advise would be give this one a miss..."
The Kissing Booth 2,26-Jul-20,Wasted 2.5 hrs for nothing. First you can't how stupid elle evans character was. Marco totally helped in her achievements still she ditched him and returned back to noah. What was the writer thinking. Marco should have been paired in the end. I think netflix did this to keep the franchise alive for part 3
The Kissing Booth 2,24-Jul-20,The first movie was already bad enough but I decided to give the 2nd movie a try but unfortunately it is even worse. completely wasted an hour of my life that I can never get back.
The Kissing Booth 2,24-Jul-20,"Full of cliches, devoid of plot or character development, and absolutely no message for teens! This movie has nothing to offer unless you want to take a shot every time someone says something cringey or does something cringeworthy."
The Kissing Booth 2,24-Jul-20,"I wasn't sure if I was going to like this one. I know it's based off of book 2 by Beth Reekles. I know the critics won't agree with me. But this seemed slightly more mature. It's YA based obviously, don't expect an adult tale. And it still maintained the spirit of the first one. Don't believe me, watch it. No spoilers in this review."
The Kissing Booth 2,27-Jul-20,"I didn't like the first one very much, but watched the second one anyway (my fault I guess!) I hoped it would be better but is dumb, too long (over 2 hours!) and very predictable. There was also possibly the cringiest sentence ever uttered in a romcom EVER! I'll probably still watch the 3rd one when it comes out, but only because I really hope Elle and Lee will FINAL realise how PERFECT they together as they have the best chemistry by far."
The Kissing Booth 2,24-Jul-20,"I don't know why so much people in the reviews are so mean about the comment about Justin Bieber's disease. Actually that is not the whole idea for the sequel. But this is my opinion so I can't change people's mind. I think that the movie is better than the first one. Is it more interesting and the acting is so much better. The thing that I didn't like is that Elle chose Noah over Marco. I know that Elle and Noah was so cute together, but Elle and Marco had to be endgame. The whole time Pena was there for her and then she chose Noah. Maybe it will be more fascinating and it was going to be more dramatic, if she chose Marco. Other than this the film was very good and I am going to expect the Kissing Booth 3 with Elle's decision."
The Kissing Booth 2,25-Jul-20,Wow. Bieber fans need to relax. It was one second of the entire movie and they called him a trucker. RELAX people. The movie was cute and enjoyable. It was exactly what you expect from this genre. Watch it if you want something light.
The Kissing Booth 2,24-Jul-20,Those who love romantic movies it's the best choice for them and a must watch movie.Best to watch at quarantine.
The Kissing Booth 2,24-Jul-20,"Really enjoyed the first movie so I was expecting the same for the second, REALLY HAPPY. Such a good feel good film, actors are perfect for the movie. Cant wait for the 3rd❤"
The Kissing Booth 2,24-Jul-20,Liked how they didn't just do a repeat of the first one but really incorporated new plots and characters into the movie and also didn't make it 100% foreseeable. Worth watching and hope there will be a 3rd movie!
The Kissing Booth 2,24-Jul-20,"Well, To be honest both the parts are nice. But, The second part will give you a emotional rollercoaster ride (be ready to take the ride while watching the movie :) ). It's way better in all perspectives. You'll definitely love the movie. Expecting for third part soon!"
The Kissing Booth 2,24-Jul-20,"Much better than the first movie, dynamics in story keep you going, set designs are amazing and actors are so much more refined. The story lines are great, except Ollie's storyline was either written or portrayed badly (not sure which might also just be how it was edited) but it was kinda hard to watch with these random scenes that didn't sit as well in the story as the first movie. But all in all, great movie, definitely recommended"
The Kissing Booth 2,24-Jul-20,Made fun of Justin Bieber and called him names when he was struggling w/ depression and lyme disease.
The Kissing Booth 2,24-Jul-20,"Honestly, it's almost as good as a teen rom-com can be in this day and age. I can't say that it's better than To all the boys I've loved before, because I really loved that movie and the second one. But Kissing booth 2 was better than Kissing booth and in my opinion it had a good storyline.I really loved Marco as a character; totally awesome guy, really handsome and actually deserved better. He was always there for Elle and really sweet to her and if I'm being honest I wanted him to end up with her. I love Elle and Noah together but there's a reason she caught feeling for someone else while in a relationship.
Lee was, as always, funny but annoying. I've never really liked him and he gets too personal with things and never knows what to do and how to fix it. But I guess that a part of being a teenager huh? I can't really decide if I liked the character of Chloe or not. She was beautiful and funny but at the beginning it seemed like she had bad intentions and I feel like she could've cleared up the confusion then and there.
So, the characters were good and their storylines too, at least better than in the first one. I enjoyed how they all, at some point, had scenes together and they really complimented each other.I would say though that the movie was a bit too long and there was a lot of fillers. Like unnecessary scenes and information that they could've skipped. Storylines that were just a bit too boring at times, for example the whole Rachel and Lee thing that was just dragged out for way too long. I guess that was the point because it was one of the main storylines, but I didn't really enjoy it. It didn't really make sense why Lee couldn't just tell Elle and Rachel the truth from the start but the other storylines made up for it.I've gotta give it to the writers this time though. It wasn't at all as cringey as the first one! I cringed maybe 3 times where there was uncomfortable scenes that could've been avoided with better writing. But the writing has improved a lot and the actors too, since the first movie. Joey King was actually good this time around, I guess she's learned from her mistakes.Anyways, I'll give it a 7/10 because I gave the last one 6/10 and as I've said a couple of times now; this one was better. I recommend it if you like teen rom-coms!"
Knives Out,08-Dec-19,"Nothing was typical about this. Everything was beautifully done in this movie, the story, the flow, the scenario, everything.
I highly recommend it for mystery lovers, for anyone who wants to watch a good movie!"
Knives Out,29-Nov-19,"What an excellent film by Rian Johnson; definitely feels like the film he was destined to make. Writing that is slick as hell, sublime performances (most notably Daniel Craig who brings his A-game in a wonderfully charismatic turn), superb editing and wonderfully atmospheric music - all tied together by masterful direction. Will probably be among the most fun you have at a theatre this year and fans of Agatha Christie and old murder mystery stories will have plenty to love here - a nostalgically entertaining time!"
Knives Out,08-Feb-20,"Knives Out is really a classic story of it's kind set in modern day with Daniel Craig even playing a very clear Hercule Poirot type character. There's a bit more humor and self-awareness than a lot of those classic stories, but never to the degree that it takes away from the twists and the mysteries. And there are some good twists. In fact one of the biggest mysteries is revealed midway through the movie which actually led me to check the time thinking ""damn, are we near the end already?"" but nope, they were just taking the movie on a left turn to Albuquerque that I did not anticipate and changed the course of the whole thing. Johnson has constructed a great mystery in the spirit of the classics. The fun of it too is how many twists there are without it ever feeling overdone. In that way also you can predict a few twists, but not another, so have fun feeling smart and still feel surprised by the others. It's just a classic fun film of its type."
Knives Out,18-Dec-19,"With the exception of my wife and daughter, and possibly my mother, Agatha Christie is the woman whom I love most on this planet. She truly was the most gifted and brilliant fiction writer who ever lived, and it rejoices me to see that her work still inspires other writers and filmmakers nowadays; more than forty years after she passed away. There are still many adaptations of her original work, but with ""Knives Out"", writer/director Rian Johnson attempts something entirely different. It's abundantly clear that Johnson was inspired by all of Christie's typical trademarks and hobby-horses, and he pays tribute to her most legendary characters and favorite settings, but the plot of ""Knives Out"" is entirely new and scripted directly for the screen. A good old-fashioned murder mystery/whodunit set in the enormous mansion of a wealthy family, full of eccentric people each of whom have dirty little secrets, convoluted plot twists, continuous red herrings that practically make it impossible to guess along, and a fabulous all-knowing but slightly odd sleuth slowly unravelling the clues.Daniel Craig is downright terrific as Benoit Blanc, a private detective with a bizarre accent and weird one-liners, hired by someone anonymous to dig deeper into the strange and sudden death of patriarch Harlan Thrombey. It looks like suicide, but literally every greedy member of Harlan's bloodline had a motive for killing and - also in delightful Agatha Christie tradition - the plot even thickens after the reading of the will. It would be a shame to reveal too much about the plot, but rest assured that is refreshing and inventive, compelling as well as humorous, complex but simultaneously light-headed and 200% entertaining. The cast is phenomenal. Craig clearly enjoyed depicting a heroic protagonist that is the complete opposite of his James Bond character, and the Thrombey family exclusively exists of great talents, including Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon, Toni Colette, Christopher Plummer and Don Johnson. ""Knives Out"" is perhaps slightly too long, but never tedious, and very well-directed by Rian Johnson (who honestly doesn't deserve all this hatred from disappointed ""Star Wars"" geeks)"
Knives Out,01-Dec-19,"As a fan of mysteries (Sherlock Holmes, Poirot, Columbo, Monk, Psych.etc.) I was thrilled to see someone making a classic style whodunnit...and the cast! Figure you can't go wrong. Well I enjoyed it & while the cast all have time to shine it is Daniel Craig with his Southern drawl & especially Ana de Armas that steal the show. For anyone keeping away because they hated The Last Jedi...I agree, it was my least favourite of all the Star Wars films, but this is a well written film that was well acted and I can only hope this will inspire others to reinvigorate the murder mystery genre."
Knives Out,07-Nov-19,"Best movie of the year, love everything about it, what I'm seeing is that some trolls that still can't get over TLJ, now for those that have and give it a 1 well that's fair but have some reasons why, not just bc it's Rian Johnson, like stop it's childish"
Knives Out,30-Nov-19,"I have read the many glowing reviews for this film and I honestly don't get it. Yes, there were some very funny and entertaining parts. It was a very good ensemble cast. Daneil Craig does his best Kevin Spacey as Frank Underwood impression. But beyond that, I found the cast woefully underused. Jamie Lee Curtis, Don Johnson etc. I expected Jamie Lee to play a major role but she seemed more like window dressing. She also, as the daughter, appeared to have no real motive for the murder. So the real crime here was her underuse. 1/2 of the members of the family had no motive mentioned. Then, when the ""murder"" was revealed at the half way point, it was clear Martha did not really do it and was being set up. Chris Evans conveniently shows up at the halfway point with lines, so the reveal, for the most part is painfuly obvious, or at least most of it. The give-aways were pretty obvious, like granny saying ""Random, you're back AGAIN"" or the comment on how the dogs barked only with certain people. The mention of the ""slayer"" law was very, very obvious. I understand this is a parody of the sleuth genre but shouldn't there be at least some surprises?Nor do I believe this is a ""commentary"" on our situation today. Yes, there was a dialogue thrown in on immigration but nothing new was covered here.That is not to say it is a bad film. Daniel Craig and the cast seemed to be having a ball. Lots of kooky things happened. But I think this is better for a late-nite Netflix watch.I certainly don't see it as being ""best of the year."""
Knives Out,29-Nov-19,"I enjoyed this a lot. Clever, interesting and plausible in its logic. I enjoyed the deception put forth by the characters. I can usually tell where something is going and was genuinely surprised by the hole in the hole of the donut.Some people might hate the politics of it, but I thought it gave a good dig at both sides while still being fairly liberal. FOX watchers will hate it, which I can see as kind of fueling the negative reviews.What can also fuel the negative reviews. is all the positive hype about it. Too much enthusiasm from the critics can hurt a movie sometimes. Viewers go into the theater expecting too much.Things never live up to the hype and this one didn't live up to it for me. But I thought it was still pretty solid and entertaining. I'm not sorry I spent some money on this one."
Knives Out,01-Mar-20,"Good acting
Awful story
Social message was preachy and unnecessary
In my opinion it was a waste of a great location and
Intersting characters"
Knives Out,07-Jan-20,"I'm a mystery lover and have seen and read every Agatha Christie tale. I found this movie very slow for the first half. Second half picked up but again there was no deep mystery of whodunit, nor the charm and period atmosphere of a Poirot episode (which I can watch over and over - thank you David Suchet and the other main actors). The lead actress was very attractive, but the vomiting was definitely disgusting to watch, as well as ridiculously unbelievable (I guess that was the funny part?). Some of the characters had been under the sunlamp too many times or smoked way too often and looked weather-beaten. Did not like the sucking on cigars constantly. The last part was more entertaining and finally there was the rapid-fire conclusion thank the Lord. Agree that Daniel Craig with that southern accent was just super annoying. Great grandmother bored me after first moments of her being silent in an odd hat. Over and over. It moved pretty slowly for me at times. I guess I'm in a minority on this one. I'm not saying it was terrible but it was not a great movie for me."
Knives Out,11-Jan-20,"The movie is a ""meh"" but Mr. Craig's voice is just stupidily wrong...!"
Knives Out,28-Jan-20,"Being a middle aged Englishman I've been brought up on a diet of murder mystery stories and in many respects I've been spoilt. When the stories have translated from book to screen the production value is almost always secondary to the good conjunct story. I was very excited, having read the reviews, that seemingly in the case of 'Knives Out' I would be getting a rare trinity of a good story, good actors and good production. It certainly has two of the three. Unfortunately this film thinks it's cleverer than it is. It's simply a story of a privileged family and their pettiness with a rather trivial murder mystery chucked in as a contrivance to get them all together. Rian Johnson attempts to display the worst nature of the privileged minority with all the subtlety of a man screaming 'I am woke' at the top of his lungs at anybody who'll listen. Unfortunately subtlety and nuance are what makes for a good mystery story, you need to pay attention so as not to miss anything. With this film you could miss probably the middle third of the film and you'd not be any less aware of what's happening. A bit of a shame really."
Knives Out,29-Mar-20,Highly recommend this movie for quarantine viewing.✨👌🏻
Knives Out,15-Jan-20,"I went into this film with high expectations to say the least. I had heard so many good things about it, so it was built up in my mind as this phenomenal murder mystery movie, but it fell short. Where do I begin? Daniel Craig has this southern accent that just does not come across as convincing, not annoying, but not convincing. The main character of the film, Marta, potrayed by Ana de Armas, has this very unbelievable physiological condition in which she vomits every time that she tells a lie. I mean, come on people. This vomiting 'tool' is used multiple times throughout the film to figure out the truth about some of the other characters in the story. Let's just say that she vomits excessively until the credits start to roll.Now, the part of this film that really upset me was the 'big reveal' at the end. It is revealed at the end that detective Benoit Blanc knew about the blood stain on Marta's shoe the whole time. The biggest issue with this reveal is why he didn't ask her about it. He would have known her involvment in the murder the whole time. Why didn't he get the blood spot on her shoe tested? That would have easily put her in the room with Harlan when he died.Overall, the movie was entertaining up until we are revealed what happened between Marta and Harlan. Once I found out how Harlan died, I started to lose interest. It basically lost the 'mystery' quality once that happened. The story went flat after that but then took off when new developments started to happen. The reason I give this movie a 6/10 is because I was able to figure out things about the story right away, which left me disappointed, and the blood spot made me question a majority of the movie. It wasn't a bad watch, but I don't think I will be watching it again."
Knives Out,26-Feb-20,"The idea of it mattering more what you do with the truth than the pursuit of it is a clever one, but instead of shining a light on prejudice, bias, and arrogance, it actually encourages all of these things in the audience by confirming all of those things in the end instead of destroying them.We're led to hate everyone who deserves hating right off the bat, and that never changes. What's worse, the people we're led to find innocuous only become more so as the story progresses. In short nobody grows and it ends up being a somewhat terrible mystery. It gets points for twists and turns, but none of those happen because of changes in the characters behavior or outlook. Johnston put all of the characters in their place from the get-go and never let them even wiggle slightly.The acting saves this movie. It is definitely worth watching just for the magnificent performances by everyone involved. It is just sad that they had to 'pay the pound' for Johnston's gross soapboxing, while the penny was the movie and mystery itself.It's interesting that there was an attempt to make fun of both SJWs and Nazis in this, while it so blatantly implied that rich entitled Americans are everything bad and illegal immigrants are everything good and hard-working. Such an unnecessary subtext in a murder mystery. especially considering it doesn't change throughout the movie...it's actually the one thing that's consistent."
Knives Out,28-Nov-19,Mildly entertaining with a great cast and high production value. The story is soft but not awful. I can't imagine saying this film deserves more than a 6.
Knives Out,03-Apr-20,"Obviously this film has a sophisticated marketing strategy - nothing else would explain the high ratings it gets. I was looking forward to it but unfortunately it's just boring and dull. You'll find more charisma and excitement in a daytime soap. Ana de Armas is the only actor worth watching, while the film exposes the limitations of Daniel Craig and Chris Evans. I wouldn't recommend wasting your time on this."
Knives Out,05-Dec-19,"Knives out uses a really old idea, the ""whodunit"". Unfortunately, contrary to what many claim, there is not much here that makes it particular different or modern, except some hipster dialogue and humor (including a lot of throwing up by a specific character) and some commentary on current social issues, like the immigrant crisis, and pointing fingers at the ultra-rich, which is ironic because the writer/director of this movie is by now a multimillionaire and one of the highest paid directors in Hollywood. The writing is full of supposedly smart dialogue and ideas. In reality there not much cleverness here, while it constantly feels like the movie is trying too hard, and comes across as very pretentious and smugish. Most of the humor falls completely flat, it is overlong (130 minutes), twists are not surprising and don't really make sense. Only bright spots, Daniel Craig's amusing performance and the very talented Ana de Armas. Other than that, a semi-entertaining, mediocre and ultimate forgettable film. A perfect example of an uninspired writer/director, with a complete lack of originality, who uses a boring overused premise and accomplishes nothing new or interesting in the least.Personally I don't know much about Star Wars as I don't really follow pop-corn franchises, so I don't know what's going on with this director and Star Wars. However, it is very puzzling seeing this mediocre film which basically takes place in a house, getting so much marketing hype and buzz, while Hollywood seems to be in love with this movie and its' director. Looking around the internet for reviews and ratings one would think this is a serious Oscar contender for multiple awards, while some people are calling it the best movie of the year and calling out trolls (?) etc. I'm confused."
Knives Out,20-Jun-20,"I felt like Daniel Craig was supposed to take the place of the excommunicated Kevin Spacey. What a stupid accent for Craig.
Overall, meh...Pretty boring. Not sure who's watching this movie and saying it's great. Their bar must be set pretty low."
Knives Out,18-Jun-20,"This movie feels like a teenager made it. It has underwhelming oohs and aahs that kind of make you cringe. Daniel Craig with and Arkansas accent doesn't help. The "" mystery"" was solved in the first 5 minutes and we were hoping for a surprise ending but just got what we figured."
Knives Out,05-Dec-19,"Generally speaking you tend to find more murder mystery TV shows than movies, this is partially since it's hard to build a complete mystery in the allotted movie running time.
This movie builds this murder beautifully by showing the different points of views of the suspects. It has a different take than other movies since it gives the viewer a little too much details mid-movie which leaves you questioning everything to the last minute.
The acting was brilliant and I didn't feel the number of characters was overdoing it at any stage."
Knives Out,01-Apr-20,"I saw the film a few months back and now that I noticed it is available for home watch decided to check the eating again, as at the time it was way too high in my opinion. I thought it would have gone down. It has not. Did I miss something spectacular about this film? Do I not have a sense of humor? I don't get it. It was ok. A bit slow. And absolutely nothing special. I think the ending was revealed too early and the twist was not suprising nor did I care about it. Weird."
Knives Out,27-Feb-20,"It's a good movie, completely different twist. But it's impossible to fully enjoy as you are getting left wing lectured from the opening scene until the end."
Knives Out,07-Feb-20,"I have no problems with the plot, even though it is overly simplified to the point of cartoonish as many have pointed out.I have a problem with the character Marta. For a character that is supposed to be the ideal ""good"" she is certainly not and Rian Johnson does not understand what ""good"" is. An entirely ""good"" character would have to do good to be considered even close to being good. Marta does nothing of the sort. She plays the game Harlan's way (no matter what Blanc says), she tries to do everything the way Harlan wants even though she knows what she is doing is wrong and that is not the doings of a ""good person."" Her character is supposed to be an angel who is the only truthful person around, who can't even lie without puking. But, she does lie and hide her puking. She also actively, willingly hides the truth till the end. If she were a perfectly good character, then she would not have hidden the truth, going to great lengths.The writer does not understand that there is no difference between actively hiding the truth and lying. Marta is a selfish person who looks for her or her family's benefit. If there is self-interest, there can be no ""good."" If there is ""good,"" there can be no self-interest. There is no difference between the Thrombey's looking out for their own and Marta looking out for her own. If one should be considered ""bad"" than the other is as well. And this is the case. This is why screenwriters should seek help from advisors of ethics when they try to write stories that make judgements about such subjects."
Knives Out,06-Jan-20,"Have to say I was a little disappointed by this, not because it isn't good. Arguably it is, but no doubt because so many rave reviews suggested this would be outstandingly good, which it isn't. So as with so many films your experience & enjoyment will depend on the expectations you bring with you.Overall I think nearly everyone will enjoy this, particularly those who are tired of the standard fair of superhero movies or bloated CGI. Having said that while this is a far more intelligent kind of movie than the comparisons it is not entirely atypical of Hollywood. One of the good things or bad things about the movie depending on your point of view is the unstated but clearly evident political commentary beneath, but not always beneath, the surface and while this might add to your enjoyment if you like your bourgeois country house mysteries subtly subverted it's difficult not to be aware throughout that the politics on show is likely to inform the solution to the movie, which without giving too much away it ultimately does.What is genuinely enjoyable is Daniel Craig's slightly preposterous turn as a southern detective with an laid on thick accent to match. The rest of the cast features some big names, but unfortunately as others have pointed out they don't always have that much to do. Jamie Lee Curtis and Toni Collette are pretty much wasted as arguably is Don Johnson.The Plot of course in any whodunnit is the biggest player of all, and while it's quite good, it isn't that good or that original. The key device upon which the solution depends is fairly basic and the solution may or may not be guessable (for the record I didn't work out who did it, but did work out the mechanism involved). If one compares this with mysteries that pose genuine conundrums and puzzlement Knives Out falls somewhat short. A part of the problem is that for much of the film it isn't clear how any crime could have taken place and for that reason one has to place trust in the story that a crime really has taken place. In the event we discover a crime did take place but given its virtual imperceptibility it never came across as in any way shocking or sinister.Perhaps the best aspect of the film, aside of Daniel Craig, was the fact that the Johnston achieves a quite nice balance between the comedy & the thriller aspects which actually makes this film a more pleasant experience than it might have been the case had it just been a straight up thriller. I'll probably be in the minority on this one but in that respect though I'd have to say I probably enjoyed Adam Sandler & Jennifer Aniston's Murder Mystery more than this, including with regard to the solution. Knives Out is the better film overall but not quite as good as it - or anyone else I'd venture - thinks it is. Still enjoyable though"
MILF,16-Jul-20,"A French romantic comedy.
It's about some forty-something friends who go to a beach house to sell it and spend time together, but their plans change when some twenty-somethings try to seduce them.
Quality.
Entertaining.
Good physicists and good performances.
Pleasant sexual jokes, as well as sarcasms.
The nudes and the careful sexual scenes and very French.
Can a man be with a younger woman and nobody says anything, but if a woman with someone younger is attacked in prejudice? That explores this movie.
It talks about mature and young love, of loving yourself at any age, highlights the value of women, of relationships that give security, that there is no age to love and value yourself.
In fact this topic is not new: Naomi Watts handles it very well in the drama ""Adore"", as well as Catherine Zeta-Jones in ""My second time"" falling in love with men younger than them."
MILF,24-Jul-20,"There is no deep storyline here. However, I enjoyed the beach atmosphere, beautiful people, erotic scenes, lovely music and hilarious nature of some scenes. This is a very good movie if you want to chill out a bit without making your mind exhausted."
MILF,24-Jul-20,Earth did all the reviews here missed that?! I bet the bad reviews belong to feminists reviewers how didn't even bothered watching this sweet honest funny movie... I'm a woman btw.
MILF,18-Jul-20,It is a movie that you feel like you are on a holiday near a villa. This movie is so enjoyable that you can watch to have fun while you are drinking your glass of wine or beer etc.
MILF,21-Jul-20,"It's a hot & humid summer here in Chicago which is typically the ripest romantic season but as we're still in the middle of this pandemic it hasn't felt quite as it should so I personally appreciated the softcore steamy escape to the south of France. I found empowering women themes played out, challenges to double standards, & some funny jabs at adult websites leading to underwhelming ""sleepy time"". HAH. I'd say a fun flick for a girls (or guys) night or solo wine & Netflix sesh. I'm a 30yo female. I noticed all the acclaimed critics almost all male... lame! They didn't get it?!"
MILF,17-Jul-20,"This is one of those movies where each scene by itself is fine, as are the actors and the scenery, but all those scenes put together make for a senseless boring misogynistic story that is not even tied together at the end. And, it's not funny, there was exactly one moment in the film where I laughed (and, mostly because I was waiting to laugh for an hour by that point), all the rest of it was tedious drama and awkward moments that one keeps hoping would end up making some sense at the end, but they never do. What a loss of time. Another problem with this film is the way it portrays women of (all ages) as weak, clingy, hung up on men, ready to sleep with anyone willing and then getting obsessed with them. The only way a woman, according to this film, can leave a man is when another man takes her away from him. Men take women or leave them, women have no agency and no core. Even the female friendship, which is supposed to be central to the story, is shown as being shallow and fickle - it's not a friendship, it's a tolerance or usage, when it's convenient. I am disappointed with this movie, especially because it employs a good acting crew, and I feel sorry for the women who played in it. For the men too, in fact. Save yourself some time and skip this sorry attempt at humor. Go watch Pretty Ugly People on youtube, if you want an engaging relationships comedy."
MILF,20-Jul-20,"It's kind of sweet and moving. I liked it a lot! Romantic, summer movie. Zero problems. Sexy boys. Sexy girls."
MILF,20-Jul-20,The movie has an interesting premise and it is executed equally well. They have explored 3 different kind of dynamics between 3 couples of older women and young men. I don't understand the hate the movie is getting because the characters are well written and are consistent throughout the movie and they evolve perfectly with the story. None of the romances are sugarcoated and all of them have their bitter sweet moments. Was a really great watch! Hope to see more from the creators of the movie.
MILF,24-Jul-20,"Good to see women of this age group represented, the movie is heartwarming, and it could reflect how single women at this age feel and the challenges they face."
MILF,20-Jul-20,"Where to start? In the first 5 minutes you can see you're in for a very weak movie! The directing, the plot and the worst, the acting! The acting is so bad in this movie you ask yourself how are those people actors! It's hard to go throw all the film, it's a very cringy one!"
MILF,25-Jul-20,Its up to you if you like romance then you will feel good and this movie is good if u like romance
MILF,19-Jul-20,"Man, I don't know where to begin. Absolutely inane plot that drags along at a snail's pace. Sex scenes that start like a bad porno but then just end before it gets interesting. Save yourself the time and just watch porn if that's why you're interested in this flick; pornos have a better-developed plot."
MILF,27-Jul-20,The most uncomfortable hour and a half currently on netflix
MILF,19-Jul-20,It could have been funnier and it should have been funnier the actress are ok in the show. But the direction and whoever is handling camera needs to go back to school poor shooting
MILF,21-Jul-20,"The divorce rate in France is very high and a little less than USA. so it seem like 3 singled mid age woman wanna have some fun on vacation or trying to sell the house (which there is no story of it).but later , 2 of them found some young punks n got horny about it. and they go for it. until in the end reality hit em back .So, maybe im old fashioned, there are reviews that some people talking about LOVE, mature woman and independent life? no idea people are that stupid to think.talk about RESPECT, DIGNITY and SHAME.. In this movie, when ladies having fun with young boys , even those boys telling each other how was that sex with old ladies n bla bla. and even its more disgusting when a daughter(one of those ladies) was with them , then even she sees her mother n friends with young guy doing stuff and she is cool with it ? ... is that normal France or part of culture ? .its not love, its just LUST and loneliness that are together which trigger in those ladies.No wonder, french women are in top 5 , the most unfaithful womens in the world."
MILF,25-Jul-20,"The movie does not open in a promising way, however in hindsight it ends up making pretty much sense. Sex scenes are not sexy, with not forced nudity. Some dialogues might be a little misogynistic but then they try to put a kind of male into perspective. Overall a decent one time watch."
Fatal Affair,17-Jul-20,"I love Long and Epps but this was GD awful, made for LMN"
Fatal Affair,17-Jul-20,Basic AF expected more. This was so predictable and had little or no substance to it. Only gave a 2 star because of the beach view (:
Fatal Affair,16-Jul-20,"So I saw the trailer and was a bit excited because it had Nia Long, Stephen Bishop and Omar Epps... then I watched about 30minutes and just thought why did they agree to this script? the movie is wayyyyy below their pay grade and you can already figure out what's going to happen next in the scenes. It reminded me of the movie the perfect guy..right down to the promo picture. waste of time and great actors...not recommending it to anyone sorry."
Fatal Affair,17-Jul-20,"The main characters had ZERO chemistry. It was embarrassing to watch. The actor's must have thought during the scenes,""let's get this over with so I can get paid.""
DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND PASS ON THIS!!!"
Fatal Affair,16-Jul-20,"I am so furious that we have two tiered talented actors in this movie and this is what we get. I am sure the actors knew it was a flop when filming. I just wish they could've been vocal about making this movie suspenseful. It was the same old type of fatal attraction movie but with no action.If you need a sleeping pill, this movie will cure your insomnia."
Fatal Affair,19-Jul-20,Why on earth would she try and save a guy who was a murderer and tried to kill her and her family. What a stupid ending
Fatal Affair,17-Jul-20,"**SPOILERS**I hardly ever review movies, but this one was so terrible I had to. I wanted to like it. I've been waiting to watch since Nia Long promoted it on The Breakfast Club a few months ago. It's one of her first turns as a producer and I really wanted to support her, but this movie is trash. First off, the entire thing is rushed. So you run into an old college friend, have a hot and heavy night and within a few days he's gone completely off the rails stalker bonkers? Then Long's character just goes down a path of bad decision after bad decision until you wonder how this woman ever managed to finish law school and work for a high powered firm when she keeps making the most asinine choices. So many plot holes, a hacker's computer is cracked in 2 attempts, random bodies popping up and the list goes on. The only redeeming moment is being able to laugh at the end and say ""You got the Juice now"" (fans of Omar Epps' debut will get that). So so so bad."
Fatal Affair,16-Jul-20,"Disappointed, acting was convincing however plot and execution really poor. It felt like a bad comedy towards the end."
Fatal Affair,20-Jul-20,"Okay, let's start with the good, shall we?I gave this movie 2 stars. 1 star for the scenery. The house on the beach was gorgeous. The other star is because the movie was only 1:29. Thank the Lord.Now...the bad (and there's a lot of bad, but I'll make it quick).Script: typical, predictable and cringeworthy.Acting: soooooo bad. I love Nia and Omar but this was a waste of their talent. And the daughter. Sheesh.Background music: will someone please kill the Lifetime movie music in the background! Ugh.Plot: What the...? So you meet this guy from college, 20 years go by and you go out with him for drinks and he just happens to be crazy? You're a lawyer; you couldn't pick up on the vibes that he was flirting with you at the office before you asked him to join you and your girlfriend for drinks? Lonely in your marriage or not Sis, you should have caught that right away.Of course he seduces the best friend after Ellie says scram because she loves her husband. The BFF is clueless because she believes this random guy over her friend for years (eye roll). Crazy dude David snaps and puts BFF in the hospital because he wants Ellie and only Ellie (eye roll). Ellie investigates crazy David, sneaks in his apartment (eye roll) and finds out just how crazy he is because he's been following her and he killed his ex wife. Crazy David pretends to commit suicide (eye roll). Everything is finally perfect, but wait...! He's alive, tricks Ellie to go to her office to sign some paperwork (at night mind you and she goes by herself - eye roll).Crazy David kills Ellie's assistant, breaks in Ellie's home, kills the daughter's boyfriend, plays 'Forget Me Not' to make the scene suspenseful and scary for us the viewers (doesn't work because you know what's coming - eye roll). He ties up the husband and daughter, kills the cop that shows up (um...you guessed it, eye roll).Crazy David is crazy and in invincible because he's so darn hard to kill (he gets stabbed but still able to chase Ellie and her husband). But here's the most laughable part of the movie: after David tries to KILL her husband, she hold on to him trying to save him from falling off a cliff.Watch this movie only if you want a few decorating tips because the house really is beautiful."
Fatal Affair,17-Jul-20,"This was just awful. The writer deserves a d...ck.of the year award for writing this POS.
As enjoyable as getting teeth pulled.
This is not what I signed up for.
Please stop making crap like this anymore and actually put some thought into what you are producing....
Again, do not waste your time on this horrible movie and shame on the producers of such garbage."
Fatal Affair,16-Jul-20,"Of course its better to work as an actor than to be unemployed.. But this movie is really bad.It sucks. Theres a lot of great and very good movies in this genre out there.. Well, they could do a comedy of this movie..Every scenes have a potential to do a hilarous comedy.."
Fatal Affair,16-Jul-20,"This film hit Netflix today and I have now watched Fatal Affair and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a woman attempt to rekindle her marriage when she has an encounter with an old friend, but he can't leave her alone.
Main Character
Nia Long straight from the 90's is the lead here and she is fine, she does a decent job here, it is just there is nothing remarkable about her character at all. She is fine in the role, but as all of this movie is she is really bland and generic here.
Supporting Characters
Omar Epps plays the stalker here and again he is fine, he doesn't stand out as an amazing character but he plays the creep fine and does come across that way at some times. Also the rest of the cast are just fine but again nobody stands out at all.
Story
The story is so bland it is unreal, I can't believe films like this are made these days, Fatal Attraction came out so long ago and this film is just a cheap imitation of it and does nothing and I mean nothing that feels unique or interesting.
Script
The script here is truly awful, it does nothing to help the actors, they do okay jobs in spite of this script not because of it. There is no big dramatic moments and no sense of humour at any point and it fails miserably here.
Style
The style has some good moments of tension, I must admit that at times when Long's character is meant to be creeped out, I was too so it worked there. But this film is paced so slowly, even though it is under 90 minutes it felt like 2 hours to me and that really hurt the film.
Overall
Overall, I think this must have been one of the quickest reviews I have ever done. It is a boring generic movie and I would avoid missing it and literally do anything else for 90 minutes of your life."
Fatal Affair,19-Jul-20,"It was pretty obvious that this movie was another stalker movie. But all that aside, it was fun to watch Nia Long and Omar Epps working together again. Nothing unique about the plot, but it was so corny lmao. I enjoyed it. I'd watch this over a Tyler Perry movie any day."
Fatal Affair,16-Jul-20,"Even for this type of movie,is really bad.2 hours of my life wasted !"
Fatal Affair,17-Jul-20,"Predictible and boring. Some tense moments but overall, it's a lame movie. I love Nia Long, she made the movie worth watching to the end. Otherwise, a waste of time"
Fatal Affair,18-Jul-20,"Shame on Netflix for delivering such a clichéd film. This storyline has been done so many times, to be honest I don't know why I even bothered to watch it. I guess I was hoping they'd bring something new to this....alas they did not. We need originality, not done to death storylines. Every Lifetime movie has this story. Give it a miss."
Fatal Affair,16-Jul-20,"No one does stalker or fatal like Glenn Close. No one. But we've had many follow it. The Stepfather, The Boy Next Door, The Perfect Guy etc... this is just another generic movie that follows it. Very wooden acting. The usual friend that won't listen and violent past of the stalker etc. There's just no reason to make this film. But it passes the time. It's a 4/5 from me."
Fatal Affair,18-Jul-20,"Absolutely, predictable, boring, poor acting and script. This is so cliche and deja vu to the max. This has been done a thousand times. Save your time on this one."
Fatal Affair,17-Jul-20,"I seriously wonder why anyone is still producing movies as dumb as this one. It is annoyingly bad. I often wonder if everyone sort of agrees that hey.... ""It's a movie, it doesn't have to be remotely believable or good as long as it's somewhat entertaining""."
Fatal Affair,19-Jul-20,Rubbish. I laughed all the way through at the ridiculous plot.
Fatal Affair,18-Jul-20,"Another stalking / obsession driven narcissistic psychopath wreaking havoc on an emotionally damaged woman. You've seen this movie before, the title was different and the actors were different but the movie is the exact same Lifetime movie you've seen dozens of times. I'm not sure how so many different writers can take credit for what is basically one movie ""written"" over and over and over again. Or why they would even want to for that matter. Having ranted that, the acting is fine. Omar Epps' David is very convincing as the loser in this predictable rehash. Nia Long's Ellie is okay as well, but did nothing for the roll that would make it stand out from all the others. What receptionist in a luxury urban high-rise apartment building would hand over a tenants key to someone walking in off the street claiming to be a friend? The one in this movie did, with a smile! Ellie did, I think, set a record for guessing someone's password. When her married name didn't unlock David's laptop she put in her maiden name and bingo, she's in. Go ahead and watch it if the one playing on Lifetime right now is one you've already seen, if not it's a crap shoot. It is sad that Netflix, in it's quest to have unlimited content, has resorted to producing Lifetime movies... smh!"
Fatal Affair,17-Jul-20,How did this film ever make it to production? Lifetime has better stalker movies.
Fatal Affair,16-Jul-20,"I was really excited for this movie, but after watching it, it's pretty much the same as any other stalker movie. I'm disappointed. Acting was okay. I expected more."
Fatal Affair,18-Jul-20,"Hey Netflix, Lifetime Movies called..they want their stolen script back!!!What a cliche'... boo!"
Fatal Affair,16-Jul-20,I honestly liked it and it kept my attention. Movies are for entertainment and it was definitely entertaining.
The Gentlemen,03-Jan-20,"The writing, directing, acting and the general production are all top notch. I have not had this much fun watching a movie in a long time. This will go down as a cult classic, so do not miss it."
The Gentlemen,01-Jan-20,"Has there ever been a bad performance in a Guy Ritchie movie? If there has I haven't noticed it. He has an ornate ability to take average actors and make them great, and to take already great actors and get even more out of them. There are a few directors around who specialise in this but Ritchie is right near the top. The cast in 'The Gentlemen' is admittedly fantastic, but it doesn't change the fact that they are an absolute treat to watch. Matthew McConaughey is in his element in a role that he was born to play, Charlie Hunnam plays one of the coolest characters I've seen perfectly, Colin Farrell is hilarious and ridiculously cool as well and then Hugh Grant gives one of the best performances I've ever seen from him. In fact Grant was so good I didn't even recognise his voice and had to wonder if they'd dubbed it. They hadn't, he'd just nailed it.The style this movie possesses is just so much fun to watch. If you've seen any of Ritchie's previous similar films ('Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels', 'Snatch', 'RocknRolla') then you know what I'm talking about. The pacing moves at lightning speed, the dialogue is quick, clever and deeper than you first realise and the conflict is always multi-layered. This one is actually told in quite a unique way with a couple of characters going over events that have already happened and it works masterfully. It breaks the story up and gives room for creativity in the story-telling process and also humour.Every time I see that Ritchie has made a movie that isn't a crime-thriller I get a little disappointed. It's not that the other stuff he's doing is bad ('Swept Away' being an obvious exception), it's just that he is so damn good as this style of movie. He's the best in the business and if he only did these for the rest of his career I'd be a very happy man. This is an excellent movie well worth your time and money."
The Gentlemen,25-Jun-20,Fun film! I was greatly impressed with Hugh Grant's performance. Had to do a double take when he first appeared on the screen. Colin Farrell was a scene stealer and Michelle Dockery makes a great mob wife.
The Gentlemen,01-Jan-20,"It's Guy Ritchies Best since Snatch, it's where he is most playful and comfortable in a film genre he knows well.
The Cast is perfectly picked, especially Hugh Grant giving a different but yet so funny performance.
Sit back and enjoy 2 hours of a British crime drama, which doesn't take itself too serious
If we hadn't had lock stock or snatch then this would possibly looked at in a more classic Ritchie film so don't expect it to be as great as those."
The Gentlemen,02-Jan-20,"Whip-smart 1-2-3 dialogue and film-editing, tension, some seriously laugh-out-loud moments, and a killer unorthodox script equals The Gentlemen.There are a lot of similarities to Knives Out within, but it would be a disservice to say it's only a Knives Out - Guy Ritchie version, because this film deserves to stand on its own merits.It's violent, it goes out of its way to be as anti-PC as possible, and its most definitely not for children under the age of 15...but most of all, it's highly enjoyable. All the performances are excellent. I can't fault this movie in any way. Maybe it isn't the bestest movie evar, but I can safely say it will be one of the best of 2020.Charlie Hunnam is legitimately scary. McConaughey nails his role. Colin Farrell has a great comedic role. All the accents are spot on. Please give me more of this."
The Gentlemen,02-Jan-20,"After seeing the film at an advanced screening I was left pleasently surprised. It is one of the best crime films I have watched and the best from Guy Ritchie...even better than Snatch and Lock Stock, which is something.From the acting to the story, cinematography, pacing, dialogue, humour and overall enjoyment I cannot fault it...10/10. Special credit goes to Colin Farrell and his acting.We dont really get movies like this anymore. Movies these days are cheap money grabbers and superhero films. This is a whole different class of film"
The Gentlemen,29-Jun-20,"Guy Ritchie returned to his early style: multiple clues, multiple characters, excellent rhythm control, various black humor and satire, and addictive violence."
The Gentlemen,01-Jan-20,Every now and again I go to the cinema and watch a film that grabs my attention straight away and keeps it right to the end. This is one of those films. What entertainment! Better than anything else I have seen for a considerable time.
The Gentlemen,03-Jan-20,At first I thought it started a little slowly but in hindsight it was just right. A perfect execution of a classic British gangster film epitomised by a charismatic Colin Farrell who stole every scene he entered and left me crying out for a coach spin off. All in all very enjoyable classic guy ritchie film.
The Gentlemen,01-Jan-20,"The rather unconventional visionary Guy Ritchie has been stuck in a Hollywood rut for the last ten years, ever since he committed to big budget, visual effects heavy films, such as Sherlock Holmes, King Arthur: Legend of the Sword and this year's underwhelming live action version of the classic Disney, 'Aladdin'. The British director goes back to his roots with the highly entertaining gangster film 'The Gentlemen' and surprisingly nails every bold punch he makes.Although his 'Aladdin' made a ton of money, critically the film was a disaster. His return to the underground world of bribery, drugs, money-laundering and blood-covered-class, is as refreshing as it is entertaining. The film's script deals with two storylines at the same time, almost breaking the fourth wall with a tongue-in-cheek commentary on today's Hollywood and how big movie studios are hungry for some original yet overly mainstream basic content, to lure people into cinemas to go watch their films.Beginning with a quick flash forward that ends with a bang and a pair of brains splattered all over a pint and a pickled egg at a typical British pub, we dial it back to a quiet evening at Raymond's (Charlie Hunnam) cosy house. When private investigator and intrusive sly fox, Fletcher (Hugh Grant), turns up at his house, he explains he has been keeping an eye on the different gangs around town for quite a while. Narrating most of the film and making some stuff up to make things more spectacular for himself, he reads his mostly finished movie script to Raymond, bribing him into funding his little project, or else he'll leak all the information he has on Raymond's boss Mickey Pearson (Matthew McConaughey), a white trash American expat who has build himself a marijuana empire.Mickey is tired of the business and is trying to sell his highly profitable company to a dynasty of Oklahoma billionaires. But when one of the underground weed-plantations gets raided by a group of British lads, filming the entire thing and posting it on YouTube as some sort of fight--music-video, it quickly becomes clear some mobster bosses haven't been exactly honest about their meetings and loyalty towards each other. This is when the real war begins - while keeping it classy.Ritchie co-wrote the story with Ivan Atkinson and Marn Davies, who haven't written anything before. The idea of the entire film is prodigious, but the screenplay and dialogue is simply unprecedented by Ritchie himself, bringing joke after joke, while taking you on a thrilling ride full of genius twists and new ways to incorporate classic gangster cinema - Ritchie-style. Composer Christopher Benstead is debuting his very first score for a feature film with The Gentlemen, and knows exactly how to set the tone and drive it up to an eleven. A promising talent that won't go unnoticed.Ritchie introduces new characters throughout the film, keeping the audience on the edge of their seat, surprising them with actual cinema, getting the best angles and money shots, thanks to his cinematographer Alan Stewart (Aladdin). When adding layer after layer to the story, going deeper into the underground scene, adding a new protagonist who's into human trafficking and Mickey's queen and wife, the cockney Cleopatra, Rosalind (Michelle Dockery), who owns a sanctuary for the ladies as some sort of business coverup to her husband's weed-empire, it becomes clear every role has a purpose and there are no extras involved in this story. One of the best acting ensembles in recent cinema history, and a welcome reminder from McConnaughey as to why he won an Oscar in the first place. But it's Colin Farrell (as the highly entertaining 'Coach') and Hugh Grant who steal every scene they're in with their remarkable wit that'll for sure land them some BAFTA-nominations.'The Gentlemen' is a ruthless first-class kick in the teeth. Do not let the failures of Ritchie's recent career choices scare you, as this is actually one of the best films he's ever made. Who knew Guy Ritchie could raise the bar not just for himself, but for everyone out there trying to brush him off as a has been. 2020 is off to a great start!"
The Gentlemen,29-Jun-20,"The story was attractive,good acts and good cast ,it could be mini series ."
The Gentlemen,01-Jan-20,I was worried that the best parts of this movie were in the trailer but Oh My Goodness.... it doesn't even come close. What a treat! I love Guy Ritchie movies but this one was extra special.Hugh Grant was phenomenal and every scene was masterfully shot. Can't wait to see it again this weekend.
The Gentlemen,20-Jan-20,"You could practice with your hands for exactly the same amount of hours, but that still wouldn't make you Liberace. Some people, whether its cooking, tennis, or snooker, seem to put balls in pockets with ease. And so it is with some actors.In this film, High Grant and Colin Farrell shine, and they have some big hitters around them.If you've seen a Guy Ritchie film before, you know exactly what you are getting. Fast edits, narrative overlay in slow motion, punchy dialogue with multiple storylines, and this film does the usual. In some ways its directing style detracts from the film as a whole. Static camera, actors on their marks, quick shots, twenty cuts, fast speaking, and Ritchie letting you know you are watching a Ritchie film. But I still like it.And the reason was Hugh and Colin. They shine in every scene, no matter where they are in the shot, you cant help but look at them, If there is a sequel, make it about these two, the Sutch and Bumdance of London, and it will win everything."
The Gentlemen,02-Jan-20,"Richie's best film since snatch. Hugh Grant gives his best performance. He is simply brilliant , funny, little camp, but deadly. Go and watch ASAP."
The Gentlemen,02-Jan-20,"You can't take it from him, Guy delivers a gut wrenching yet fun and often laugh out loud British crime flick. The script was an absolute delight with some of the best dialogue I have heard in a very long time, delivered to perfection by all the main cast. It's a delight having a director and writer like Guy to keep the movie industry fresh, we need more original content like this being rewarded for originality.The cast, well Hugh Grant was fantastic, you quickly realise Grants been underused in films, he has range and this shines through. Colin Farrell too was an absolute standout when on screen, he stole the scenes and had me in stitches. The cast in general though were all brilliant, many many standout scenes.You have to watch this movie, supporting movies like this is important, original content is hard to come by and we need more of it. And trust me, you can't not enjoy this!"
The Gentlemen,04-Jan-20,Guy Ritchie is back in his movie manor of gangsters and plot twists.Hugh Grant is a revelation.Go see it. Nuff Said.
The Gentlemen,02-Jan-20,"When all the critic reports come out and the inevitable 'mediocre' scorings appear don't be worried: this is a very good film and Ritchie is back to his best.Snatch is a favourite of mine and I must say that this film surpasses it, in story, tone and cinematography. The twists are good, the jokes are great but what stands out are the performances. A 'star studded cast' seems to be the highlight of every movie nowadays but let me tell you, the majority of the performances in this film are oscar worthy and pure gold. I say majority of course because Jeremy Strong enlisted one of the worst acting performances I've seen this decade!It is by far a better tribute to cinema than that 'Once upon a time' nonsense and I urge you to see this film.The only drawback for me is the third act. Too many pipes are introduced late in the film which contributes to a somewhat lacklustre and crammed finale. But apart from that a solid film."
The Gentlemen,01-Jan-20,"The Gentlemen is a wildly entertaining film with a fast paced, enjoyable story that keeps you guessing throughout. The way that Ritchie utilises narration in this film is very clever and is not the heavy handed exposition dump that you might see from lesser quality films.
The stellar cast is well credentialed and they all give excellent performances in this movie. A special mention goes out to Hugh Grant, who is far removed from his pigeonholed romantic comedy role to deliver a fantastic performance.
The Gentlemen is a great way to start 2020 and I highly recommend giving it a viewing"
The Gentlemen,26-Jun-20,"This is a typical Guy Ritchie movie, there is a story, it isn't always easy to follow, but style is even more important. Matthew McConaughey is American Mickey Pearson who went to England as a young man on a Rhodes Scholarship. He soon learned that he had a knack for selling drugs to fellow students and that eventually blossomed into his vocation on a very broad scale. Now in middle age has decided to sell his marijuana empire, which included a dozen well-hidden farms, and retire to a leisurely life and maybe have a few rug rats with his beautiful and devoted wife. The price? Just 400 million British Pounds.As the news of that gets around a number of shady operators want to get their cuts from a number of devious means. So the movie is mainly about that and how Mickey and those loyal to him devise methods to protect him and his investments. The cast includes a number of well-known actors and the roles are uniformly interesting.This is a good movie for those who appreciate and enjoy this type of British underworld movie, there aren't really any characters who are good people, there are just different degrees of badness.I watched it at home on BluRay from my public library, my wife skipped, not her kind of movie."
The Gentlemen,27-Mar-20,"In Love Actually, Hugh Grant, who coincidentally also lends his acting talents to The Gentlemen, tells a group of reporters: ""We may be a small country, but we're a great one too. (The) Country of Shakespeare, Churchill, The Beatles, Sean Connery, Harry Potter, David Beckham's right foot ... David Beckham's left foot come to think of it.""Well, in my opinion, he forgot to mention Guy Ritchie, who is known for his gangster films Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998) and Snatch (2000) among others, as well as the Sherlock Holmes' films of 2009 and 2011. With The Gentlemen, Guy Ritchie goes one step further in proving himself a national treasure of our friends the Brits.With the help of a cast comprised of big names and lovable favorites such as Matthew McConaughey, Charlie Hunnam, Hugh Grant and the inimitable Colin Farrell, as well as an intelligent, engaging and entertaining script, Guy Ritchie once again comes through in delivering sumptuous fare for the eyes and ears and heart. Here, Mickey Pearson (McConaughey), is a powerful American marijuana dealer based in England whose plan it is to retire and sell off his marijuana empire for a cool £400 Million to spend more time with his wife. As can be expected, more than a wrench is thrown into his plan. What ensues, is giddy entertainment a'la Chef Ritchie's Specialty of witty, super-fast, intelligent, humorous exchanges and more than a few sleights-of-hand by a gallery of engaging and colorful characters who are thrown into numerous subplots, countless twists and turns, betrayals, confrontations and several inevitable revelations.Sounds confusing 'duneh it'? It isn't.Sit back and enjoy the rich mischievousness with which this is all served and rest assured that Ritchie is a master. With a deft and artful hand and sure command of his narrative threads, he has fun rearranging the linearity of the story (which if attempted by anyone else might be confusing), and delivers something close to a masterpiece.8.7/10"
The Gentlemen,04-Jan-20,"Guy Ritchie once again defines the dark gritty and hilarious antics of gangster LondonI believe fans like myself would be very happy if all of his future projects were of a similar calibre. Guy, I can believe that when you were starting out with Two Barrels that this is what you wanted to do. Keep doing it.Well done Guy, Hugh, Charlie...and everyone elseDoes anyone else think Colin Farrell is an underrated comic genius?"
The Gentlemen,01-Jan-20,"Literally can't pick a fault with the film, hilarious, great characters, great story line, definitely up there with being one of Guy Ritchie's best film to date, and a must watch in my opinion"
The Gentlemen,01-Jan-20,Guy Ritchie returns to his story telling ways and it's brilliant. Charlie Hunnam and Hugh Grant are particularly amazing in this film and have you wanting more. Ritchie is back and I hope he doesn't leave.
The Gentlemen,06-Feb-20,"I wanted to like this film. But I just couldn't. It wasn't comedic to me. And it didn't strike a cord of being a real-life engaging thriller to me either. It's very stylized. And although style can work in certain circumstances when the viewer is appropriately brought on-board. I felt like the plane left without me. A style really doesn't work if the characters become too artificial while trying to play-off an essence of reality at the same time.Much of the story about the main character (McConaughey's) is delivered as investigative conjecture from another character(Grant's). So as the narrator character reveals the main character's story, the narrator can later change the result of events we perceive by just revealing that the conjecture he presented before was inaccurate. This gets old really fast.Maybe this can work if the conjecture is absurd and funny or if the conjecture rings very true most of the time. That way it surprises the viewer when it's revealed to be wrong. But as I explained before, I didn't overall get a sense of either quality within the story-telling.Overall the film seemed very ambitious. But all of the pieces didn't seem to quite make sense to me together. And they might have been better off removing a few elements for this particular script.I wasn't too sympathetic for the characters I was supposed to be sympathetic for. I didn't understand the logic to some of the character decisions. Some of the moments of ""big reveals"" didn't seem too surprising to me. And a lot of the narration got annoying to me. More often than not it's better to show than tell the viewer what they need to know. I didn't think the voiceover was helpful in showing but telling. To put it simply, I felt it was more style than more substance. And the music didn't seem to help the storytelling to me either.I hope you like it if you see. But I also hope that if you have similar concerns and inclinations as me, that my review might spare you some time and/or money. I know I wish I had stayed away from this one."
The Gentlemen,01-Jan-20,"Went to a New Years day performance, best film of 2020 so far for me.
The film combined London gangsters, London Youth, wealthy aristocratic types and even asian gangsters seamlessly.
The pacing was outstanding, characters interesting and story competent.
Go and support this film!"
The Silencing,20-Jul-20,The reviews here are being far too kind. Whilst it has an interesting premise the film just bungles along and has far too many plot holes and characters making absurd choices.The writing is pretty bad and annabelle Wallis' performance is seriously phoned in and at times - just bad. The reveal of the killer is a serious let down and the motive is just not believable at all.The scenery is nice but the cinematography is very uninspired and very low budget looking. Give this one a miss.
The Silencing,19-Jul-20,So yeah the movie is actually pretty engaging and its backed with an amazing backdrop and a solid performance from Nikolaj . However this movie is far from being unforgettable as it is let down by a cliched climax. The last 15-20 mins of the movie makes its feel like its just an another serial killer movie .. The movie lacked originality that at some point it had to resort to the way a serial killer movie would usually go. People who are fond of this genre could enjoy watching this movie without any expectation once ..
The Silencing,19-Jul-20,"Everything about this movie is ""okay"". The story, the characters, etc. are all okay. None of it is bad. But none of it is fantastic either. It does the bare minimum a good movie should do. Good acting. Good writing. Good pacing. Good filming. Good editing. From a technical, movie 101 perspective, everything is textbook and it doesn't make any huge mistakes.However, where the movie prevents itself from being very good, is in the following two things:1. Ruins one very good opportunity and turns it into a pointless plot device. Midway through, a discovery is made which raises the stakes tremendously. From that point, the film could have done something very good. But in the end it's rendered useless as the plot jumps onto something else. And the villain emerges with very unconvincing motive.2. It's a carbon-copy of a much better movie called Wind River (2017). I couldn't help but notice the similar look/feel within the first few minutes. The setting, the music and how the story opens was very similar. And much to my disappointment, the borrowing of ideas didn't stop there. The rest of the movie is practically the same. So if I could recommend one thing, is to go and watch the that other movie (Wind River) instead. Wind River is everything that this movie wishes it could be. In every department, that movie is fantastic."
The Silencing,21-Jul-20,Solid 6 star film. Not great not terrible. Dragged a little here and there but was still watchable.
The Silencing,19-Jul-20,"You can definitely tell the writer and the director were heavily influenced from the True detective series for this particular film which is a good thing imo. The visual style, thematics, and plotting aspects are executed in similar fashion as the show. The overall story is relatively run of the mill as far as the murder mystery, and seeking revenge in tracking down the killer. Still it stays interesting enough and never gets too stale with enough intensity and suspense to keep attention. The actors are all decent and keep a level of intrigue throughout. Also some very well done cinematography and fantastic scenery/settings. There are some moments that seem a tad cliché like a big reveal towards the end, but overall it does what it needs to as a basic thriller."
The Silencing,20-Jul-20,"Decent directing, excellent cinematography, but the writing needed more ""oomph"" and a more cohesive plot with less plot holes and technical issues. A good watch, but nothing spectacular. Would've been better as a short film, as the 93 min runtime with the slow pacing made this film feel much longer."
The Silencing,18-Jul-20,"I love murder mysteries, movies that dont give away the plot to early. So this one was actually good i didnt figure it out to close to the end. The acting was 6/10 and the plot and writing was also a 6/10 thats why i gave it a 6/10 rating. I find that when a story has good character building and it really gives you good background into why things happen in the story.but it wasnt developed enough for me the Sheriff played Alice Gustafson, and the male lead Nikolaj Coster-Waldau as Rayburn Swanson did a great job. Id recommend it for a good watch nothing more then that"
The Silencing,25-Jul-20,"'The Silencing' had all the things I love in a film. It had unexpected moments sprinkled throughout, a lead character I liked and wanted to be alright in the end, a whodunnit element and some twists. What more could you ask for from a thriller? This was the type of movie that was coming out every week back in the 90s, and they were all great, yet these days you're lucky if you get one every couple of months and they're not usually as good as they used to be. So when I come across one as well done as this film was it is a rare treat.Nikolaj Coster-Waldau from 'Game of Thrones' plays the lead role, and he was a remarkably good lead-man. Not only is he naturally likeable but he is also very easy to sympathise with. His character has had something awful happen to him and so he has become an alcohol and can be quite unpleasant to his ex-wife's husband for example. Sometimes these characters can be very hard to get onboard with if they're played by the wrong actor, but in this case I was happy to look past his flaws and get on-side with him.As mentioned earlier I really like a good whodunnit. They're incredibly out of fashion these days unfortunately, but 'The Silencing' is a great reminder of how well they can work in cinema. I really enjoyed this movie and would highly recommend people give it a watch."
The Silencing,21-Jul-20,"It's always interesting to see what the stars of big and beloved shows do after their characters leave (or when the show ends, sometimes in a manner that's anything but beloved... Yes, Benioff and Weiss), so a thriller with Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (Game of Thrones) and Annabelle Wallis (Peaky Blinders) was anticipated with intrigue. The setting and plot topped the cake off with a cherry. And so, ""The Silencing"" is quite the decent thriller - never reached the stars and pales considerably in front of its spiritual similars and perhaps inspirations (True Detective, Wind River etc.), but no aspect really in this movie is below the average.Nikolaj portrays Rayburn Swanson, a reformed hunter living in solitude in a wildlife sanctuary, troubled deeply by the disappearance of his daughter years ago. A deadly game of cat and mouse ensues, as he and the town Sheriff Alice (Annabelle Wallis) set out to track down a newly active serial killer who may have also kidnapped Rayburn's daughter. The story provides most of what one would expect, chases, clues, violence, investigative and other misconceptions, offering also some minor plot turns that could raise a couple eyebrows. Though serious and working on heavy themes, ""The Silencing"" lacks suspense and the atmosphere that could've been, as plot largely functions on familiar tropes and leads to a rather clichéd final act. Where the first feature screenplay by Micah Ranum doesn't realize its full potential, the performances, geographical backdrop and visual work tries their best to make up for it. I took some issue with the character of Alice, and Annabelle Wallis didn't have a whole lot to shine on, whereas Nikolaj's offering of Rayburn felt like the most fulfilled character, and acting performance within ""The Silencing"". Shot in Ontario, Canada, ""The Silencing"" utilizes the landscapes and small town's drab charms well, though this backdrop eventually plays a role smaller than I'd wish to see. Cinematography's solid if not exactly impressive, though throughout I was thinking it'd do better with a little less greys in color grading.""The Silencing"" feels lesser than it should've been, but it's never bad or truly boring. Decent, but forgettable, lands in the middle, one of those many movies that feel disappointing for... not being disappointing. Fans of rural thrillers, devious small town shenanigans and serial killer mysteries should be able to find a kick or two in ""The Silencing"". My rating: 6/10."
The Silencing,21-Jul-20,"This is definitely worth a watch. I'm a very picky viewer and if a film doesn't grab me in the first 10 minutes then I'll quickly turn it off. I'm happy to report this kept be interested for the full (nearly) 90 minute run time, which is the perfect length for a picture like this IMHO.Jaime Lannister once again did not disappoint. I thoroughly enjoyed Shot Caller so I figured I'd give this a try as well and I'm glad I did. A couple decent plot twists along with good performances from all actors and a decent script held this picture together quite well.Its far from Oscar worthy, but its also slightly above straight DVD, $1 store trash bin. Just a decent little thriller that should hold your attention for 90+ minutes. I recommend it."
The Silencing,23-Jul-20,"Nice movie. Well performed, filmed and directed. Writing needs more depth on some characters and less in others. Too much expectation created around the main guy beeing a great hunter for nothing, and the woman being sheriff just to shoot a civilian without any consecuence at all. Uhmmmm...besides that is entertainig. The constant drinking didnt added that much either because it was missused."
The Silencing,22-Jul-20,"Slow and lugubrious like a funeral procession with a by the numbers script we have all seen before - Nothing new to see here, quite a tedious & depressing sub par thriller if you can even call it that."
The Silencing,22-Jul-20,"A clone of a better movie really, Wind River is a much more interesting and better paced watch."
The Silencing,20-Jul-20,"Interesting setting, with okay cast. Just needed a little improvement in writing."
The Silencing,18-Jul-20,"Ive seen better movies on this subject/topic, and that is because there are too many inconsistencies and loud screams of ludocrisity done by the caracters in the plot. a superindependent sheriff that does the lonesome ride everywhere danger is, and the parkkeepers lack or will of communicating with police and others in dire situations, a w/t or a cell might have given some truthfulness working or not, or a simple houseline phone or better. its also hard to understand the police juristictions and the way law enforcement are dealt with, it just becomes deadwater where there are no push to be found.acting wise, and the filmographic presentation are well done, much thanks to the choice of locations and nature scenery, but the story are plotted like good old ''twin peaks'', extremely slow, and wait till next weekend to get another clue.its a film that will enerve some and make others bite nails from the nerves, the grumpy old man liked the first one third the rest is for you to decide. its a recommend anyway"
The Silencing,22-Jul-20,"Really good! Lots of tension and twists.
Exactly what I'm looking for in movies now: No more of the same.
A movie that I'll probably gonna watch again!"
The Silencing,22-Jul-20,"Everything is nice except it's a tad bit slow at times, lacks much action.... the movie on the whole is nice and definitely worth a watch on a lazy Weekend."
The Silencing,20-Jul-20,"You would figure that in this day and age movies would need something more to be approved. A true story, or based on true events, unjust conviction, innocent and found guilty. I mean there are thousands of real stories out there that are interesting, thoughtful and memorable.Why spend money, time and effort and make an average film that probably barely break even, especially in a time where the biggest bang for your buck, the theaters, are shut down?I always hope hollywood will get better at making films but they never seem to do."
The Silencing,19-Jul-20,"I gotta admit, this was a solid film. A watchable serial killer film with a couple of nonsensical scenes but overall consistent to the end. I do enjoy that the killer was not revealed unto the very end, and that's a good sign of someone putting in the time of writing a somewhat coherent story. For me it was a one time kept my attention the whole time watch but not to be watched ever again film."
The Silencing,19-Jul-20,"This movie truly sucked.
Tried to get in to it, but decided to take a nap.
Time better well spent."
The Silencing,19-Jul-20,"It could be a pretty good film. Acting of Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, the background were pretty good. But... Sehriff ruined it all as a character. Boring, sexist, lack of moral.Such an irritating character. Then we've got a dull plot, which would have been more acceptable if it had included some others storylines. I mean i do not feel anything to the majority of cheracters, which had everything to get at least a small story behind them. Like why someone is drug addicted, what fell parents of kidnapped girls and so on... Rayburn Swanson was told to be always drunk, but we never see it. It appears only as a fact with no circumstances.
There is not much to say, just an usual film with some modern tendensions. But it has nothing inside and doesn't make feel anything."
The Silencing,19-Jul-20,Was pretty cool to see all the shots of the Northern Ontarian city that I grew up in. Seems like Scuzzy Sudz is getting famous :)
The Silencing,20-Jul-20,"I like the mystery, story-wise, albeit seems like a copy of other films; and the twist too. The cinematography is pretty darn good. Nikolaj Coster-Waldau delivers such good performance among other okay-casts. Overall, this film is good but there is still room for improvement. It's not that wow but it's watchable."
The Silencing,29-Jul-20,"I am generous with a 9 cos i enjoyed this movie. Simple, aint no wannabe critic. It is rare to find good thrillers n horror films nowadays.
This movie has ample amount of tension n suspense. It started without wasting any time n at the same time it delivered developed characters n background stories.
The twist came as a surprise.
The plot may remind viewers of Nic Cage's Frozen, Renner's Wind River n Most Dangerous Game.
The story is about an alcoholic ex hunter who has become an animal savior n lives secluded in a sanctuary named aft his daughter who has been missing since five years. The arrival of a new sheriff brings some hope in the method of investigation but things get ugly aft a discovery of a female teen's dead body pointing to a killer who is hunting teens for sport."
The Silencing,27-Jul-20,"A little slow start, but then turns into an edge of your seat thriller."
The Rental,24-Jul-20,"I really wanted to love the hell out of 'The Rental'. The trailer looked great. The cast (particularly Dan Stevens and Alison Brie) sold me. The fact that Dave Franco was making his feature film debut as screenwriter and director intrigued me. I was cheerleading for this movie to be a good, if not great.But this movie was, unfortunately, only a 'watch once/mixed bag' kind of flick. It's the plot of almost any low-budget ""Home Invasion"" or voyeuristic horror movie made in the last 10 years but with a slightly prettier package. Netflix's 'The Open House', 'Afraid', 'Ratter', 'Hangman', '13 Cameras', '14 Cameras'... if you've seen any of those movies, then know what to expect with TR.I cannot fault Dave Franco's solid directing, the cinematography and good cast performances - it was great to see Alison Brie return to the horror genre since her appearance in 'Scream 4' and Dan Stevens is always a treat. But unfortunately, the storyline for The Rental is just too bland and predictable to make a real mark. I expected more suspense and something a little more memorable than something that can sit in a crowd of similar titles and still be seen as derivative and unremarkable. I also didn't have the best time with these characters; too much relationship drama and not enough build-up of suspense.I'd have given this a 4/10, but I'll give it an extra star because of the cast, direction, and good production values of the movie overall. Still, a ""rental"" at best.5/10."
The Rental,26-Jul-20,"A generic, pointless and anticlimactic movie that fizzle out into nothingness.
It always amazes me when people get a shot at making a full length movie (in this case, Dave Franco) and when they don't have anything new or good to bring to the table. Then why even bother?
A waste of money, time and talent (Stevens and Brie.)"
The Rental,25-Jul-20,"I wanted to like the movie, but sadly it's been done before and better with the movies in my title. That said the cast is great, I think Dan Stevens is one of the best actors around.So In my opinion it just doesn't do anything new and the ending was also poor, let's hope Mr Franco can come back with something a little more original next time."
The Rental,25-Jul-20,"""Five Dead in Coastal Massacre""It's a movie about 4 dumb friends falling prey to a homicidal voyeur, probably?Act one is a slow-burn set-up of the characters and their situation. Nobody is particularly interesting.Act two is the first act of 'I Know What You Did Last Summer'Act three (the last 10 minutes of the movie) is all four main characters being hit in the head with a hammer and the killer setting up his scheme at a new location.That's it.That admittedly spooky shot of someone running up to the stalled car in the trailer is that characters off-screen death scene, seconds later in a very brief and dark shot, another character is hit in the head with a hammer. Within a couple of minutes the third character is killed by, you guessed it, being hit in the head with a hammer. If I'm being honest I already forgot what happens to the last girl as I was so checked out by that point that I truly don't even care.Don't bother."
The Rental,26-Jul-20,"I didn't like a single character in this movie. A complete waste of talent!!! The characters were boring, stupid, selfish, and immature. I had really high hopes for this movie. It was pointless. Absolutely no closure. I didn't care if a single character lived or died. There are soooooooo many wasted moments that leave you wandering why. They should have used teenagers. At least it would have justified their stupidity."
The Rental,25-Jul-20,"The many one-star reviews here provide an interesting glimpse into popular taste. Apparently, a movie about psychopathy is supposed to end with some Scooby Doo unmasking, where the crazed maniac who has just murdered the entire cast unmasks himself and reveals some perfectly reasonable, linear motivation for his behavior which, upon looking back, the viewer will realize has been cleverly foreshadowed by the filmmakers all along. This is the convention--oh, so that's what caused all this mayhem!--and of course it's sometimes satisfying, but more often than not it renders the film cheap, tidy, and forgettable. And the lengths filmmakers will go to in order to sufficiently shock you--the red herrings, the duplicitous sociopath best friends--is often quite awful. It's been decades since I saw the original BONE COLLECTOR movie, but I'll never forget my bafflement and utter disappointment when the big twisty reveal happened and all I and my companion could think was, ""Who the heck is that?"" Honestly, it would have been better if the killer had just been a random person.Which, I'm pretty sure, is how serial murder often works. The idea that some narrative bow is going to tie everything up at the end of a bloodbath is, well, disrespectful to the victims of the unfortunate number of real-life bloodbaths this country bears witness to. Sometimes people are just violent and deranged and like to watch people suffer, and though they probably have reasons for their behavior, that behavior probably has little or nothing to do with their victims. Would it have made things better if you learned at the end of THE RENTAL that the killer was the caretaker's brother, and that he had been cheated on by his wife, and that that's why he murdered anyone any time he witnessed a sexual transgression? Would that make it okay? Would that make their murders sensible and satisfying?That said, this isn't a great movie. I like the fresh, anarchic randomness of the conclusion, and Toby Huss and Jeremy Allen White are standouts in the cast, but the screenplay suffers from some implausible depictions of psychology and behavior--which is to say, too often the characters make choices that just seem terribly stupid and unnatural, and it seems like they only do what they do because the plot demands it and not because actual people would behave that way.So, yes, this was neither an excellent nor an awful way to spend 89 minutes, but anyone suggesting that a review of more than 4 stars is a ""paid promotion"" has an extremely narrow view of what a movie is allowed to be like."
The Rental,24-Jul-20,Way better than the ratings. It keeps the intrigue for the first part and the rest has a good rhythm. Pretty decent directing by Franco. I don't see it lower than at least a 6. It is one of the lowest ratings compared to the quality of the film I have seen in my whole life.
The Rental,24-Jul-20,"The Rental is a new horror thriller directed, written and produced by Dave Franco. This is the first film he has directed and he is more known as an actor in the film world.In the film, brothers Charlie (Dan Stevens) and Josh (Jeremy Allen White) decide to go on a weekend trip with their friends. They have found a perfect house online by the sea and are trying to make it a pleasant weekend. They only suspect that their landlord is somewhat racist towards Josh his Muslim girlfriend Mina (Sheila Vand). Despite this mistrust, the four try to make it a fun weekend, but during this time together they get to know each other better than they expected. This is how their mutual relationships are tested. When Charlie discovers they've been secretly filmed all weekend, he must choose to find the hidden footage or confess what he secretly did over the weekend.Dave Franco has portrayed this film as his first directed film, but he has also taken on a bit too much hay by partly writing and producing this film. By taking on all these different tasks, he still struggles to convey the film clearly. At one point, the movie almost comes across as a long episode of Temptation Island and turns more into a teen drama than a horror thriller. This aspect comes to the fore without further explanation. Due to these unclear and sudden changes of genre, the film can come across as tedious.The acting comes across as nice, but due to the unclear script, the cast doesn't really have many chances to make something special out of their roles. The characters initially come across as adults with work, but later the characters behave more like teenagers."
The Rental,25-Jul-20,"I have respected the film makers much more during the pandemic. We definitely need them. And I really had high hopes for this movie. Set-up was very well; a remote house, friends getting together and a killer on the loose! Tell no more, i am sold. But unnecessary dialogues, pointless character developments took forever, and the last 10 minutes some weak killings! Thats it! The whole mystery behind the killer was just comical. As if the budget came tight and they had to squeeze the real movie into this one."
The Rental,24-Jul-20,"When watching such films, you are kept glued to the screen because you want to know who's doing all this and why. And when you find out it's a nameless, faceless person with no motive whatsoever, other than this being his hobby/full time passion, it renders the whole movie a waste of time."
The Rental,25-Jul-20,"Don't waste your money on this terrible clunker! What a waste of talent because the cast is top notch. The script is subpar and the story ridiculous. It was beyond amateurish.So sorry Lip, Trudy and Matthew. Wink!"
The Rental,24-Jul-20,"Two brothers and their significant others spend a weekend in a beautiful beachfront villa. What could possibly go wrong?Dave Franco does a decent job for a first time director. The Movie is beautifully shot, atmospheric and moody as all hell. The cast is awesome, I always enjoy Dan Stevens and he's a delight here, but so is everyone else. I almost loved this movie but sadly the whole thing falls apart in the third act. Its as if a tense thriller is interrupted by a slasher film and its as abrupt and awkward as it sounds. That said the movie does not go where you expect it to and it is shocking and surprising."
The Rental,24-Jul-20,"This movie is just awful, I don't know what anyone working on this film thought they were making but the plot twists are ridiculous and only come about as a result of them all doing the stupidest stuff. It might have made more sense with a younger cast because between the affairs, drug use and childish attempts to hide crimes it was nonsense."
The Rental,27-Jul-20,"Terrible story.......
If there are 5 characters and all 5 die, you don't know or care who the killer is!"
The Rental,24-Jul-20,"Whilst this is a decent effort for a directional debut with a constant feeling of tension and uncomfortability, the R18+ rating and horror genre classification seems misplaced.There's a real longing for a decent new horror film, and this isn't it.If you've seen every other horror film and have nothing better to do with time to kill, then give this film a watch... but if you don't get a chance to watch it, you're not really missing anything great."
The Rental,26-Jul-20,"My oh my...The beginning is kinda OK despite the unpleasant characters and the empty dialog. But it takes a long time for anything to happen, and when it happens it is so cliched and anticlimatic one wonders what the writer was thinking about.The ending is one of these facepalm moments when one realizes that one has wasted precious time on a bland, toothless, generic pseudo horror film.""The Rental"" is a semi-slasher film where instead of idiot teenagers being killed one by one after doing stupid things we have four woke grown ups being killed one by one after doing stupid things. The difference is that in ""The Rental"" all the killings occur in the third act.It is not worth your time."
The Rental,28-Jul-20,"I was actually rooting for the bad guy. The characters, minus the wife, were so horrible that I honestly could not have cared less if they died. I love James Franco, but this was so terrible."
The Rental,26-Jul-20,"I've seen a lot of IFC films and if there's one thing consistent among every release it's that they specialize in the unique, and this film is no exception.What is sadly not surprising is the audience reviews here that seem to completely miss the point of a movie like this. A problem I see on the outset is that the film is billed as a horror but is more of a slow burn dark thriller, similar to that of The Gift or The Invitation or Come To Daddy, such that I generally know where it's headed but the journey contains enough unforeseen events to make the trip worthwhile.User criticisms of the third act aren't valid, in my opinion. People seem to think that if a story isn't spoonfed to them then it makes no sense or is sub par, but the opposite is usually true. In this film, the tension of the characters comes to a head and chaos ensues when what's supposed to be a fun getaway for an average group of friends turns creepy and violent after multiple betrayals of trust occur. The scary part is the ending because it touches on the unnerving reality that there are some very sick people out there in the world that take advantage of the trust we hand over to strangers, a naivete that most of us don't grow out of until later on in life, sometimes never. The very last shot during the credits is the scariest, it reminded me of the ending to Creep.The only aspect I feel is lacking is the score. I feel the composers needed to work on bringing a bit more excitement to some scenes that clearly called for it, but instead i felt the soundtrack was too slow. I don't feel the composers were trying to capture the mood of the characters at all and instead were going for scary at all times.I give it a B+, a relatively short but unique thriller that's worth the watch."
The Rental,25-Jul-20,It's a complete waste of money. All this above 4 stars (those are paid promotions). Very very bad and cliche story. Too many holes and too much nonsense.
The Rental,24-Jul-20,"Two couples, cabin, weird land lord, cheating, death and no explanation, the end. Do not watch, anyone positive about this piece of feces is brain dead. Avoid like the plague!"
The Rental,27-Jul-20,Very predictable and nothing special. Been done plenty of times. Scenery was great acting was okay and story was terrible. Loved to see Lip again.
The Rental,24-Jul-20,"Two couples go for a country outting, hell ensues. You've seen it all before and this tired, oft-rehashed lukewarm not-so-scary horror fare will add nothing to your knowledge. Watch it if you're dead bored with your life. Or not.
Yeah, better not."
The Rental,25-Jul-20,I made it halfway through the movie and gave up from it being super boring and cliché. Foreshadowing cheating couples.. really?.. The hot tub scene was super cringe. I expected more from one of the Francos. You are a normie Dave.
The Rental,28-Jul-20,It really annoys me when people get drunk in these movies and drink in spas and pools.So dangerous.This movie could've been much better.The people in the story were not aware of their surroundings and were annoying.I switched off .Not my kind of movie.
The Rental,27-Jul-20,"I've had more fun watching water boil. I can not believe anyone thinks people want to wait an hour for anything to happen in a movie. Why even bother making it? One if the worst movies I've seen at the theater. Not worth a watch for any reason,"
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood,26-Jul-19,"I love Tarantino. I was super excited to see this. The movie started. And then it went. And I waited for the plot. And then it came and went within the last 15 minutes of the film. Then I left confused and a little disappointed.The movie just felt like Tarantino wanted to show off how much he knows about film history and how nostalgic the old Hollywood made him feel. The acting was amazing. The cinematography was amazing. The storyline just wasn't there though. I want to say I loved it so bad but it just felt so flat to me.The characters didn't really develop at all. Leo's character just kind of changed halfway through with only a narration as to why he was different. Brad Pitts character was the exact same the entire film. Margot Robbie's characters development was that she finally said like 20 words at the very end.The ending was the most enjoyable part without a doubt. That felt like a classic Tarantino scene. The rest of it though just felt like a normal movie. The dialogue didn't feel like him to me for the most part, with the exception of a few scenes. The soundtrack was phenomenal and caught the vibe of the movie flawlessly.Maybe I was just hoping for more or maybe I missed out on something. It was an enjoyable movie, but it just felt off to me. I really hope he will make a final movie to end his career with a bang, because this is not the one"
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood,27-Jul-19,"The first 2 hours is only for lovers of everything late 60s retro,great cinematography and outstanding acting.The last 45 minutes fasten your seatbelts because classic Tarantino kicks in."
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood,26-Jul-19,"Here's why not everyone will like this movie: it's not like all of Tarantino's other movies, and it's not like any modern movies either. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is a melancholy, slow burning, comedic love letter to an age of Hollywood that we find ourselves disconnect from nowadays.The point of this movie isn't to be just like Pulp Fiction and tell stories that have no meaning. In fact, I would argue that Tarantino wants each and every story to have a meaning. Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a faded action star struggling to hold onto his career and fame. Every scene he was in was enjoyable, as he internally argues with himself to be better than he is. He can't find work except for as a typecast villain, and turns down an offer to go overseas initially because he thinks it's too far a step down from his past career. Dalton's story was not as fun to me as his stunt double, Cliff Booth's (Brad Pitt), but I will get to that in a minute. Dalton's story, some will say, was boring, overdrawn, and pointless. I say it was the most important and interesting storyline in the movie. Rick is an alcoholic, and deals with a lot of anger towards himself, particularly in his trailer (you'll see what I mean), and the long scenes showing him act out his part as the villain in the western are extremely entertaining as DiCaprio does some brilliant work letting us see Dalton as an actor without losing touch with him by slipping into acting of his own. He finally decides to go overseas, but most of that time is spent in a montage. When he returns, he dons a new Italian wife and an entirely new fashion straight from Europe. He doesn't do much towards the end, except for burn a manson follower alive in his pool, and then he finally becomes friends with his neighbors. I'll also get to that when I talk about Sharon Tate. Rick is representative of Hollywood at the time of 1969, and unless you are familiar with film history, that will be lost on you. In 1969 movies like Easy Rider, Bonnie and Clyde, and The Graduate were changing the face of Cinema by eroding censorship codes and finally getting the studios to hand the reigns to directors, thus entering the age of auterism. Actors like Rick were becoming absolete in film for a number of reasons, but mainly that they hadn't had to search for work whilst under the studio system, they just signed a contract and found work immediately. Roman Polanski, his neighbor, was one of the directors that was now given a lot of free reign in this age, . Dalton's character expressed the frustration many probably felt at the time, and Tarantino built a character that was beautifully acted by DiCaprio.Cliff Booth on the other hand, was the most Tarantino character in the movie. I think he'll be the fan favorite, because he requires no historical context or empathy to understand. He's a stunt double who lives much worse than his star, Dalton, and is a no-no sense badass with a muddled past. His scenes were incredibly fun, as Pitt brought a certain energy to each scene that glued you to the screen waiting for his next move. Particularly at the end, when Tex had him at gunpoint and he was tripping on acid. Obviously he had the situation under control, but we as the audience have no idea until he sicks the dog on them. Booth was a character you expect to see in a Tarantino movie. None of his storyline was used for what people will say is ""pointless"", mainly because he is the most involved with the Manson clan.Interestingly, the Manson clan is hardly shown in the movie. Charles himself only shows up twice, and only says a few words. I actually like this choice, because it left a lingering thought that perhaps Manson was a danger at all times, and didn't play to the audience the way we thought it would. It wasn't a story about the Manson murders. Manson just happened to be going on at the time Dalton and Booth were having their struggles, and it intersected.Which brings me to my last point, and that is of Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie). Her role, while a tad less utilized than I expected, was Central because the real life Tate was murdered by the Manson clan. If you go in as an audience member with that knowledge, you go the whole movie waiting for something to happen to her, and it never does. Tate herself was a happy, blooming actress who spent time with friends and danced (a lot). This carefree manner was underlying a want to be famous, as she tells people who she is and is clearly disappointed when they don't recognize her. Tate plays a role in this story of showing the era of actors now replacing Rick Dalton, and also showing special to Hollywood, the silver screen's allure. As this is essentially a long love letter to Hollywood, Tarantino pens what drew him to the screen through Tate.With all of its references, obscure or in your face, there is a delicious amount to absorb, especially for cinefiles. Tarantino has the viewer to sit back, eat up the screen, and imagine we are right there with the characters in a wonderfully painted portrait of a Hollywood long gone. This movie will be misunderstood because of the expectations for the Manson murders, and because audiences nowadays expect action on every corner, which Tarantino's name can be attached to in some capacity. Without any crazy special effects to speak, simply a fantastic script and acting, I think many audience members will get bored or not understand why it's entertaining to others. I personally think it's one of Tarantino's best, if not his absolute best, and will stand the test of time for movie lovers everywhere. Agree or disagree, we all have to admit that Brad Pitt's dog was awesome."
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood,27-Jul-19,"It reminds me of that old fable. People go to see Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio in a film by Tarantino and assume it has to be great despite what they are actually seeing on the screen.. The film is incredibly slow paced and neither funny nor suspenseful. Throwing in a 5 minute fantasy violent scene at the end after over two hours of boredom did NOT make me change my mind..
Sadly disappointing to this fan of most Tarantino films."
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood,25-Jul-19,"I LOVE QT films and couldn't see this movie fast enough. All I can say is what was that all about? It was so boring. Did anyone edit this film? Leonardo's character was not likable. The only person tolerable was Brad Pitt. Nothing happened what so ever. The dialogue was not clever. The movie never went anywhere at all. It was just endless scenes of other movies being made. People driving in cars. Bare feet over kill. By the time the ending happened I didn't care anymore. I wanted to LOVE this movie, but I haven't been this bored in a long long time. I wish i felt differently."
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood,25-Aug-19,"If this script (if it could be said to be a script) had not been from Tarantino, it would have never reached theaters (and perhaps not even on cable television movies).Long, boring and pointless."
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood,23-Aug-19,"Cinematography - great, acting - great. Music- reused already written works. Plot - none. Just almost 3+ hours worth of some random scenes stiched together without leading anywhere. Watched it twice. Has not changed my opinion. By the time it ended I did not care anymore, I just wanted to pee!!! After sitting there for almost 3 hours. What was the point of this movie? Still wondering.
One of the Tarantino's worst (if not worst!)."
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood,12-Jan-20,"As much as the characters were interesting and the references to actual events were intriguing I suspect this film skews to an older demographic that has an inkling about the Hollywood of the time and how society, language and fashion sense was.Margot's legs are definitely hot and she needs to show more skin more often.The dog is a star and needs to win a prize."
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood,10-Mar-20,"In short it had all the elements I seek in a movie.It had action, it had violence, it had an atmosphere, it actually mocked Hollywood, it had Playboy bunnies, Margot's legs were spectacularly exciting and thin and in a microskirt OH MY
Did I mention I love violence?
heck, I love dogs.Great movie."
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood,23-Aug-19,"If a no name writer came with such non-sense, their script would've hit the bin within the first ten pages. The script mocks every theory on character and plot development. Yet, the same gurus who would trash a rookie script writer for bringing anything less then perfect, are bowing now in humble awe to the great QT. This in not about double standards, but about Hollywood having no standards at all."
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood,31-Jul-19,I can't spoil this movie because there's nothing to spoil!!! No plot. Nothing happens. If I submitted this same screenplay to Hollywood it would get rejected.
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood,28-Jul-19,"I have seen this film twice in the last two days, I probably will see it many more times.Tarantino has shocked and surprised me before, but this was the biggest shock of all. The movie is set in the Hollywood of 1969, just before the brutal Manson family murders.Leonard Dicaprio and Brad Pitt give career high performances. Dicaprio is Rick Dalton, a TV cowboy actor who longs for movie stardom but has now hit the skids. Pitt plays Cliff Booth his stunt double/driver and all around best bud. They also represent doubles of each other in real life, though Dalton is angry and frustrated at his failings in life while Booth is perfectly happy to be his pal's gopher and handyman. There is good recreations of TV westerns of the time, Dalton had been the star of ""Bounty Law"" a show that never existed but is clearly based on Steve McQueen's ""Wanted Dead Or Alive"" series. Dalton is now playing guest role villains on TV. An actual series ""Lancer"" is recreated here, I never saw this show when it aired since it was on up against ""The Mod Squad"" in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Dalton has some funny and touching scenes opposite a precocious 8 year old actress while doing the ""Lancer"" episode. The late Luke Perry has his final film appearance in these scenes also.Margot Robbie has an almost magical presence playing actress Sharon Tate. Tate unfortunately is best known today as the most famous of the Manson family murder victims. We see not only how beautiful she was but also how good and kind she was as well. One of my favorite scenes is when she goes to a movie theater to watch ""The Wrecking Crew"" a film she made in 1968 with Dean Martin. We see actual clips of the movie, (with the real Sharon Tate) and cuts back to her reactions, she becomes delighted when the audience laughs at her comedy bits and applauds at her fight scene with Nancy Kwan.The film starts to turn dark when Cliff picks up a teenage girl hitchhiker who wants to be taken to Spahn Ranch, a run down movie set where he once worked. I have read nearly everything about the Manson case, so I knew where it was going now. Cliff sees a bunch of mostly hippie girls hanging around and asks if George Spahn the original owner of the ranch still lives there. The scenes at the ranch are quietly disturbing. Dakota Fanning (I did not recognize her) plays Squeaky, one of the real life Manson girls. Her vacant eyes and cold manner make for some suspenseful moments. Cliff is concerned about his old friend George and demands to see him. He finds him now old and blind (Bruce Dern in a great cameo) but at least alive. Cliff is still suspicious but leaves the ranch.The final act comes up for the biggest shock of all. Rick has returned from several months filming some spaghetti westerns in Italy.He has also gotten married to an Italian actress. It is now August 8 1969. Cliff and his faithful pit bull Brandy are staying the night at Rick's house. Sharon Tate and some of her friends arrive at her home (which is right next door to Rick) to spend the evening together. Then Manson followers Charles ""Tex"" Watson, Patricia ""Katie"" Krenwinkel, Susan ""Sadie"" Atkins and Linda Kasabian are driving up the road. I knew what was coming and was dreading this moment, I was hoping that Tarantino would not show the gruesome murders but I was preparing myself.
Then Rick hears them driving up and has an angry altercation with them, then I was a bit surprised that real life characters were suddenly intermingling with fictional characters on a night when a horrible historic moment happened. When Rick goes into the house, the killers suddenly realize that he was the star of the TV show ""Bounty Law"". Then psycho Sadie goes on a rant about how TV showed her generation how to kill by showing murders every week on the small screen. I had heard some Manson followers had actually said this. Linda is too scared to go with the other three and takes the car keys and drives off leaving them. Another change in the real story, Linda did not participate in the murders but did stay with them, so once again I am getting bewildered. Tex, Sadie and Katie than decide to go to Rick's house rather than Sharon's. I am wondering are they now going to kill them also? Then the most surprising thing happens, Cliff, his pit bull and Rick decide to fight back against these scummy creeps leaving them to be battered and massacred. Brandy has some great scenes as one of the most heroic dogs I have seen in film. My head was reeling by this time, I kept thinking ""Are they really doing this?"" Then came the ending, Rick is now safe, Cliff injured but alive. And now Rick gets to meet his next door neighbor Sharon and her friends. I am still in shock but then for the first time we see the title on screen ""Once Upon A Time... In Hollywood"" and then I finally get it, this is a Hollywood story not real life, this is what we wish would have happened.I finally had to see the film again for a second time so I could actually enjoy that climatic scene, without the dread and confusion I had the first time.
This is a phenomenal work, like nothing I have ever seen and probably never will again."
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood,01-Sep-19,"All this critical acclaim for this film (mainly because it's a Tarantino one) is so baffling. So what's wrong with it? For a start nothing actually happens throughout until the last 10 minutes. It's a slow, turgid, self congratulatory affair with drawn out scenes and tons of tips of the cap to the 'era' - through the soundtrack and product placement of 1960s packaging, or 'real life' characters like Sam Wannamaker's appearance - that just aren't needed. They even splice Di Caprio into the Great Escape as a 'what if?' moment...but all for what? Just Hollywood slapping itself on the back again about being Hollywood.There were genuine tense moments like when Pitt's character visits the Manson family allotment that turn into a damp squib. Again why was that scene so long? Why did they spend so much time on Di Caprio playing the baddy in the western but no time at all on his character's move to Italy (apart from the fact Tarantino wanted to imagine what 1960s spaghetti western posters would've looked like with DiC in them!). And what was the point of Al Pacino? Or Sharon Tate's character for that matter once you see the ending....?This was a missed opportunity that could've been a great piece on an actor's dwindling career that just turned into a boring series of sort of linked scenes...albeit quite well acted ones. Tarantino is become the new Woody Allen...actors want one of his films on their resume despite the fact he hasn't made a good one in so long"
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood,11-Sep-19,"Where to start? The end credits !Possibly the most boring, self indulgent rubbish I've ever seen. No plot to speak of, disjointed bits and pieces lumped together with no thought or consideration of any editing.I question how this ever got made, no one other than QT would have gotten away with this.Spoiler free review as nothing happens to spoil !!!"
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood,16-Aug-19,"After all the hype around this film I was sorely disappointed. With an A List cast, as it had, it should have been Gold. The acting was terrific by Brad Pitt, Leonardo and Margot Robbie. The storyline sadly fell short, way short. The era was captured really well however I sat through the first hour thinking it was painting the scene and that the real action would start. I kept thinking that until the last 20 minutes when things finally came together, however, that was nearly 3 hours of film to sit through before any real appearance of the film I was expecting."
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood,04-May-20,"This was exciting and needed. This movie is for both entertainment and social awakening. This was to entertain and to show the acting skills of lead roles and sexy legs of the main actress I feel like this movie was made for bright audiences. Unfortunately, it will be hated on by chubby American women. Sorry but even Tarantino had to go all the way to Australia to find a hot set of legs."
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood,21-Jul-19,"I don't typically leave IMDb reviews but this film deserves so much praise for its risky screenplay in such a dark true crime setting.For 2 hrs, 41 minutes, I was taken 50 years back, experiencing Hollywood's film industry as a comedic drama filled with desire, tension and everyday life.I liked Brad's character the most, but Leo easily matched with his own performance. A definite see-it-in-theatres watch. Bring your sense of humor though. There are lines of dialogue and laugh out loud bits that completely satisfy your curious mind. Expect everything you would from Tarantino, but also what you wouldn't.I gave it a perfect 10 because I forgot I was watching a nearly 3 hour film, even though it still wasn't long enough for me. I would like to see a director's cut up to an hour longer as I think this is a unique case that extra footage would only help such an already powerful story.I had the privilege to watch an early 70mm screening of this film at the cinerama dome with the director, Tarantino, in the audience. It was a surreal experience I'll never forget."
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood,17-Feb-20,"The film was intriguing and original, but which straight man can say no to legs, waist size and hair like that? One of the most exciting and evocative movies I have seen in the last couple of years since Hollywood went Taliban on us. Make the time and watch it."
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood,27-Jul-19,"Even great actors can't save this storyless plotless meandering piece of self-indulgent nostalgia. It looks like they had a great time making it and to heck wirh the audience. I love the old-time movie feel of most of QTs films, but come on, you need a plot. You need to tell a story. As QT famously said a movie should make you want to sit down over a piece of pie afterwards and talk about it. Soon as our
group walked out all anyone had to say was how painfully boring and self-indulgent it was. That was it. QT you gave us nothing to talk about."
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood,25-Aug-19,"Almost all artists reach a stage in their careers when their egos become greater than the quality of their work and this is the perfect example of that. Tarantino clearly believes that his genius is so great that he can serve up 3 hours of the dullest, most self-indulgent, rambling mess of a story and expect everybody to just accept it as a masterpiece. It's not even mildly entertaining like his more recent films have been.Anybody who thinks that they have seen genius in this film and that only the 'informed' movie connoisseur can understand what Tarantino is really trying to do here, is just a pretentious fool. This film is an insult to the viewer and evidence that Tarantino has truly lost the plot."
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood,07-Feb-20,"It took Quentin Tarantino a lifetime of living, 5 years to write and a 2 hours 41 minutes watch. This is a love letter to a film industry that is no longer recognisable. Hippies, short skirts, westerns..... all have disappeared from our movie world. But worry not, Quentin Tarantino is here to remind us of old school film making from a once beloved industry which has been described as being on life support.The performances are flawless. I was apprehensive about how the events of August 8, 1969 would be handled. But that is handled tastefully and respectfully, yet with the classic Tarantino flair.Will be quite a bit for those under 40 who have no recollection of this Hollywood. Some will categorise this as an over indulgent nostalgia trip for movie geeks. And they are likely to be correct. But for those of us who complain that Hollywood is reduced to remakes and comic book films, QT delivers a unique and creative viewing experience."
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood,26-Apr-20,"I Enjoyed this filmThis film entertained me, it was funny, uplifting, had action and an attractive woman which in Hollywood nowadays is as scarce as a clean customer at Wal-Mart. What more can one ask for? I will be watching it again!"
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood,17-Jan-20,"She is beautiful and this film shows her off in the best light.When I go to the movies I want something superlative and different and this film does it.
Of course it is a Tarantino movie so one gets witty dialogue, interesting characters and violence and action.Love it."
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood,12-Jun-20,"Either lovers of this film will deem it too low or haters of Tarantino will deem it too high.
Six out of ten is fair for me because the film was mostly aimless, but I had a good time with the teenage skank, the main actress and her sexy legs (please go into porn) and the last 10 minutes. Really good screen presence Mr Pooch."
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood,21-Jan-20,But watch it for Margot's sweet slender legs showcased in a tight mini skirt and boots. SCHWING!!It is Tarantino so you will get surprises and action too. Fear not!
Love,15-Jul-15,"The script is laughable and the acting (often voice-over), too. The 3D sex is well marketed. And yes, during certain scenes people got up and left. Yet. The film doesn't argue to be anything beyond a meandering stroll into the gallows melancholy. And it does this very very well. The film features no highbrow intellectual conversations but instead, favors the same lines you've probably slung at your lovers. Again and again and again. Just like the sex you've had with your lovers again and again and again. You know their bodies and you know how to please them and above all, you know how to hurt them. Sorrow. There's a resplendent simplicity here that hypnotizes the viewer.You hear music banging inside the club, yet the lovers are outside in halflight. Having sex, obviously. This is a good image of what this film surprisingly achieves best: intimacy. And it fights for that with it's magnificent camera-work and editing.But what would this review be if it didn't talk about the 3D sex? Love and cinema are inseparable. Love stories are why you stick glued to a chair for a couple of hours. Raw sex is part of love, yet, films used to cut to birds necking after a kiss. Then it became steamy windows. Signs, metaphors, analogies, semiotic nausea. And here, Noé takes that away which makes the film even coarser, and ultimately more brutal.I wanted to write this review because the whole marketing (""finally a love story restricted for -16) and shock value (an eye-rolling warning in the opening credits) have cheapened what this film has achieved and I encourage viewers to look beyond."
Love,21-Aug-16,"I know I only rated it a seven out of ten but that's because I admit this film's faults. It certainly isn't near perfect but I felt very moved by the characters and their story. Lots of people may not be able to relate to this film however those of us that do can say that everything about this depiction of love has been experienced and is real. As a grown single adult living in today's dating world I can attest that the relationship between Murphy and Electra exists. Their obsession with each other and with sex that led them into a deep and possibly unreal infatuation was honest and thought provoking. Love sometimes doesn't make sense and can't be described or made logical. Their connection was what drove them into darkness, madness and despair. Love is completely all consuming on any level it's represented on. So many times have I given myself up for something that a year later I looked back on and couldn't reconcile my behavior, and so many times have I given myself up to something to only sabotage it before it completely devoured me. I don't know if I have been in love, but I have felt what these characters are going through and I wouldn't know what else to call it. In the vein of Harmony Korine and Lars von Trier I think Gasper Noe is a genius. Yes this movie is uncomfortable, yes the acting isn't great and yes the story is dry, but it's a genuine take on what relationships look like for some people in their mid twenties to early thirties and I loved every second of it."
Love,22-Oct-16,"Love is Gaspar Noe's latest film. It's essentially porn. Long, drawn out sequences of sex throughout. But there's a story, and that's what could be interesting about this film. Not since the early 70's has pornographic films experimented telling actual stories instead of just getting straight to business. Nymphomaniac is the last film of the modern era that attempted this, and it absolutely blew me away. This would've been fascinating, but instead, it's PAINFULLY boring. The story line and dialogue sucks. I didn't feel for anyone in this film. The acting was extremely stilted, but in porn films that's pretty much the norm. The cinematography is the only standout. It's beautiful to look at, as most Gaspar Noe films are. However, I despised the black screen that would appear every time there was a cut. As well as the many shots of the main character standing inside a doorway with his back turned to the camera, listening to an annoying voicemail. Why did he do that? Why would he think that would work? If there's a profound reason for those two editing decisions, I'd like to know.. not that it would make me feel any differently, I still hate it. Love is not only a missed opportunity, it's a film I'll never remember, or want to remember."
Love,28-Nov-15,"I have nothing against sex. I love it, I love watching it but this was painful. The sex was hot but the story and the acting was terrible. I think it was not worth it and very very long. I can see what the director was trying to do but he missed the mark. For the same kind of story with the sex dial down and the story dial up I would suggest The Dreamers. This story could be told in about 30 min, add maybe 30 min to get invested in the characters and that would be good. 2h is way to long for this and 5 min sex scene every 10 min is too much. Like the title says. Watch porn it will be more fulfilling.Now for the actual review. The plot is simple. It is a guy reflecting on a past relationship. The guy is a little to dysfunctional to be in a healthy one but it is not extreme. The only real question you have during the movie does not get answered and that is about it. I would not recommend this to anyone."
Love,18-Nov-15,"'Love' will most likely be discredited by many due to it's sheer honesty, like many films of it's kind are. Yet this honesty, as brutal and daring as it might seem, feels necessary to connect with and understand what the characters are going through, on an entirely new emotional level. In the words of Murphy, Gaspar Noe might have made the only movie that truly depicts 'sentimental sexuality'. 'Love' has many subtle and not-so-subtle references to the underlying story and to the director himself. Gaspar's mother is named Nora Murphy, while Murphy's son is named Gaspar and Electra's ex boyfriend - Noe. His favorite movie is Kubrick's '2001', while hers is Lang's 'M', both of which seem to fuel Murphy and Electra's behavior throughout the movie, where Murphy is often aimlessly overwhelmed with hope and desire, while Electra seems unable to forgive.Gaspar Noe constantly cuts through the past and the future, using the techniques he is so familiar with since Irreversible. The movie abruptly switches between various stages of Murphy's and Electra's relationship, always cutting back to the present, where Murphy's is in absolute emotional agony and despair, raising a child with Clara. At times Murphy and Electra are so deeply engrained in one another that their fights and dialogues seem outright comical and immature, as if we are observing a 16 year- old couple. But this is truly where 'Love' stands out. Being in love feels and looks exactly like this, it's raw, emotional and brutal yet foggy and sweet; when no one else exists or matters.In one of Electra's and Murphy's conversations they talk about the sad reality that they are going nowhere and dragging each other down, they discuss taking a break. It is an extremely sad and emotional scene, where the thought itself brings so much fear into them, that they simply end up holding each other even tighter.The script for 'Love' is only 7 pages long. It is full of beautiful and weird dialogues and extremely emotional, 'free-played' graphic scenes. These scenes however are not there to impress the viewer or open the doors to the unknown. This is also not a nymphomaniac-like sexual exploration. Gaspar Noe does a masterful job in showing us the true emotional aspect of love, in it's raw and relatable form, sex.The sound-score is stunning, with the music gradually changing depending on the mood and the context of the scenes. Even though a lot of times it seems like we are watching the same people 'fuck' in the same positions, different context, feelings and music make each of these scenes truly unique and mesmerizing on it's own. Noe also does a wonderful job in his minimalistic depiction of the story and the scenery. Murphy and Electra always wear contrasting colors, while the background is usually very simple yet fitting to them both. As if to say that when in love, everything should be seen through the eyes of the lovers. 'Love' might sometimes seem silly, overly graphic and way too sentimental, yet it hits all the right notes."
Love,10-Jan-16,"Love, as it is titled, should be called Bored Whiny Man Child. This dirge clocks in at a whopping 2 hours and 15 minutes. I had to stop, walk away for a while and then return to watch this sniffling character act out his hypocrisy in such myopic detail. The relationship between the two principal characters is like oil and water. The only thing they share is a voracious appetite for sex, lots and lots of sex. The add a third person into the mix who winds up getting pregnant by the guy which leads to the main couple breaking up. Since they all were in a ménage à trois, that shouldn't have been an issue but it was. The female leaves him and we spend the rest of the film exploring his memories of her and him having more sex. They participate in orgies and he gets mad because she's having sex with other guys. He can had fun but she can't. If your life is nothing but the sex, why should that matter especially if he can participate and she can't? And there lies the quagmire with this presentation. This guy is totally immature. You become bored with him and with him having sex. Closeups of him with his exploding orgasms weren't shocking, innovative, wanted or move the picture along. After a while, you just want this story to just wrap up. You wonder what is the point? There is nothing redeeming about it. The other female character who has had his child is completely ignored. She is just another prop instead of exploring that dynamic of how they are dealing with a child together. Instead, we find his character crying in the bathtub with the toddler. And you have to ask yourself once again, the time he and his old girlfriend were together appears to be at least three years because you have to factor in the time the girl was pregnant and then you jump in time to see a toddler at least two years old. So why did his old girlfriend/s mother call him about her and why did he just started thinking about someone who hasn't been in his life for a long time? The writing was just poor. This guy was suppose to be some aspiring filmmaker. He is neither aspiring or making films and filming your naked girlfriend on a small video camera doesn't qualify you one bit. That aspect of the character was totally ignored as well. This was just bad. If you want to see if because of the unsimulated sex scenes, I would advise just watch some 5 minute porn clip and avoid this colossus time waster."
Love,28-Oct-15,"No one was able to walk out of the theater this evening as the director Gaspar Noe was in the audience. I'm certain he took note of folks laughing at scenes meant to have profound emotional impact, like the entire ending. Little character development with the main character's 17 yr old wife, or 18, they had sex when she was 16, nothing more than a prop. Their child, the unintended creation of a broken condom, is named ""Gaspar"". The wife is an orphan of sorts, unwanted by her mother but somehow has the cash and wherewithall to rent an apt in Paris and do nothing more than go clubbing, listen to her iPod and bang strangers. Profoundly self-indulgent about lost love, but hard to take seriously when the lost love happens between supposed college students (we never see the college, college books or a single classmate) living and partying in Paris, none of whom even are even remotely worth caring about. Except perhaps the teenage wife, after she gives birth, but again her only role is to get banged, have a kid and though otherwise absolutely gorgeous, kind and loving as only a supermodel with minimal lines can be, this one only serves to annoy the hell out of the main character. Reminded me of Brown Bunny, but that was a film with guts. This is just an excuse to film cumshots in 3D, wrapped around a plot that never went anywhere with no sense of finality or a hint of revelation or completion. In fact, the movie had to flash a massive THE END for the audience to know the film was over."
Love,18-Sep-15,"There's a point when the main character and voice-over narrator on Love says that he never sees a movie presenting ""emotional sexuality"". Sex, semen and blood, that's what people would like to see. Murphy is a filmmaker, or so he says. Actually, I think he is just a puppet to Gaspar Noé intents in this too stereotyped film that had the big ambition to be innovative.Love has been creating some noisy around the world, and has been like that since its premiere during Cannes. Explicit sex and love scenes on 3D, that is how the movie has been known mostly. Despite the bad reviews, I thought it would be at least interesting. It wasn't, at all.Before the first scene, there's a sign announcing the moment to put the 3D glasses on. And so the terrible nonsense begins. At the very begin I've already realized this movie is just noisy. The sex is explicit and so, so boring, that I was begging to the characters to finish their business as soon as possible. What was announced as innovative, is just a bunch of clichés put together. It is filmmaking in its worse. Gaspar Noe thinks he knows so much, and that he is above the other mere mortals. His condescending arrogance is staggering, actually. I imagine him thinking: this world is so mediocre, full of prude hypocrites, I'll show them how it's done and make a movie about excruciating love and sex. So he started to write it and finally realized it wouldn't be so easy. To talk about life, and love, and sex it is necessary to be really alive, and not just criticizing the other's ways from outside. Unable to write a true love sexy story, he decided then to check every box that came to his mind relating to sex: explicit scenes, close on dicks, threesome, sex clubs, homosexual sex, trannies, public sex and so on. As if a close on a ejaculating dick would be the quintessence of a revolutionary speech. There's a bunch of unrelated scenes, as if the awful voice-over could succeed in giving them some meaning. An example: at one scene, the couple are lying on bed after sex, and from nothing, the guy asks the girl about her biggest fantasy. Sexual? she replies. Of course, he says. And she tells him how that she would like have sex with him and a third woman, a blond with blue eyes. The next day or so, they are getting their mail when they meet the new neighbor: a sixteen blue eyed blond that are living next door. After the badly filmed threesome, the guy says: thanks for Europe! (a place where eh would have a three way sex with a minor). Did you get the image? So.Gaspar Noé, by his main character, affirms that there's not sexual love stories on the screen. I think he never saw any of Bernardo Bertolucci's movies. Or the Spanish/French production Sex and Lucía, a beautiful story about love with stunning and heartfelt sex scenes (Paz Vega is incredible). Or even Betty Blue, for everybody's sake. Or even 9 Songs - even with all the bad reviews, this one is actually honest. Sorry the rage, but it is inevitable. Noé should look better around him, or, even better, he should head to the DVD section on a store and just see how wrong he is. I've read how the acting here is terrible, and it is a fact. The actors are not even able to walk naturally (it is so staged that hurts), let alone show deep feelings or have real sex. And despite what has been said, I don't think it is difficult to find good actors that would accept to be a part of this project if it was a good one. At least his protagonist should have been more endearing - even if I'm not sure that it would have saved this doomed story anyway. Because the problem here is not just the bad acting, the lousy dialogues, the incredibly lousy and staged sex scenes. The main trouble in this movie is the sexist, arrogant, wrongful view about the world and people. And when a filmmaker start this way, there's nothing that can save him from the impending doom. People were leaving the theater constantly, they were dropping like flies. However, rather than doing that by how explicit the sex is, I think people did leave for the sole reason of how bad is this movie. It's unbearable in fact. And we see no end to it, two hours and fifteen minutes of sheer bad filmmaking. Not could be more far from deep emotion, an intense love story and visceral sex.

Love,28-Apr-18,"Porn disguised as an artsy love story. 95% of the movie was sex and the rest was going to clubs, drinking, and drugs. Did these people even have jobs? Do yourself a favor and watch a porno. At least they have plots."
Love,07-Jan-16,"I went to watch this movie in 3d in Mexico based on some video reviews I had seen that said it was an ""experience"" that had to be lived. How far was that from the truth.Love in 3d, which is the title the film had in Mexico, is a tedious, unnecessarily long film that has no real story, statement or message.Its a long porn video with a bad script. The film is supposed to pose a question about what love is, but never really addresses it or takes any kind of position about it. Furthermore, it extends its scenes way past it should. The ending sequences, for example, are just endless quasi-reiterations of the previous scenes that add nothing to the film. You think it is over, and boom! another sex sequence, and then another and another. The ""cuts"" the film uses are also poorly executed. I understand using the cuts for when you jump in time between the scenes but if you do not, why do you still use it? Half of the time the cuts are used, the movie does jump in time,but the other half is just an annoying blink of the screen to come back to exactly the same point.If this had been a 15 minute short then it might actually had made sense, but a 2 and a half hour long movie was definitely way more than a stretch. Save yourself the time and money."
Love,14-Feb-16,"It is a 2:04 hours movie.Take out all the scenes where they present you with genitalia and you have a bit over one hour left. If it was a philosophical movie, perhaps there would be a part of the sex sequences that carried more meaning - but there is no such relief in this movie.We are presented with a stereotypical immature, selfish, arrogant, possessive young male studying cinema in Paris - apparently only to get stoned and laid. He meets this sweet, proactive, sexually empowered young woman that also enjoys drugs. Not the least stereotypical, as she falls for him with deep and unbridled love. His love is also deep but he is the villain here, so he get as many other women as the time not having sex with his official one allows.She notices it (who wouldn't, at this rate?) and tells him she also has had her escapades. He makes scene after scene, including beating up her lover (an ex- boyfriend). He tries to bully a police officer inside a police station.She stands by him in another stereotypical situation.Then this monster gets the pretty blonde underage neighbour girl pregnant. This is where she draws the line. Notwithstanding the fact that she was the one that suggested they get another woman in bed. Despite the fact that she made the move to invite the blondie.Then she goes down into a spiral of drugs and alcohol, shutting him off her life completely.Once more, stereotypes.He keeps the blondie, they have a little boy (that he names after the child he and the lost love dreamt to have together - stereotype, anyone?) and, as he drags himself in a pool of self-pity and despair (which does not go unnoticed by said blondie), comes the news that the original girl has been missing for a couple of months.Then he spends a full day calling people to try and find her. In the meanwhile, blondie leaves with the boy, telling him to finish his past so they could have a future.Obviously, he doesn't find her - which doesn't preclude his opium- induced dreams of her to interrupt all the time.There is a very awkward scene with him and the child in the bathtub, after blondie's face tells us she will leave him.And the movie ends with him and original girl embraced under the shower professing endless love and protection.Oh! Did I mention that it is partly filmed backwards, as 'Irreversible' was? By the way, they used a very similar setting - an underground passage - in one of the sequences. Check it out: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0290673/?ref_=nv_sr_1 Or that this theme of intense, destructive, drugged and short-lived love was way better portrayed in 'More'? Also, a good part of the soundtrack comes from Pink Floyd.... See it: (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064694/?ref_=fn_al_tt_2In other words, apart from all the sex, this is a derivative, shallow and unworthy movie...The '3' I gave the movie is for photography and soundtrack. Really good in all scenes, conveys mood and context.The rest is crap."
Love,18-Nov-15,"Having just come back from the UK Premier, I can honestly say, that was quite simply appalling. Only Kill Your Friends is a worse film of 2015.I absolutely loved Enter the Void with a passion, the poster has been my iPhone screen saver ever since. It was slick, stylish, sexy and trippy.Love, however fails to deliver on so many levels. I get what the director was trying to achieve here, but it just doesn't work due to the appalling acting from the very unlikable main character. Where on earth did they get him from? Was he the only actor who was willing to show his erect cock on the cinema screen? His lines are delivered with such a flat misanthropic moribund tone that you can't believe anything he says. The voice over just adds to the car crash. Its a film which lacks any real emotion or chemistry.If you want to watch a gritty film with real emotions watch Blue is the Warmest Colour and 9 Songs. Caspar Noe, you have let us done badly here. Go back to making in your face trippy films."
Love,13-Sep-15,"I guess I fell for the marketing, and I have to admit the idea behind the film still seems OK. The 3D effects were good & not overdone. On the other side: I found the script / plot to be thin, and the acting and voice overs were terrible. I got the idea this was a movie made by an American director who was trying to make a 'european' style movie but didn't succeed. Afterwards I read the director is French (born in south America).The movie lasts more than 2 hours, but there is no suspense, no buildup, etc. Karl Glusman (the lead actor) is not credible in this role, the emotions don't seem real and his voice-overs are even worse. His character begin a 'movie director' or something of the kind seems almost irrelevant and implausible.After an hour, the movie started getting tedious as it was obvious this 'wasn't going anywhere'. I don't recommend seeing it, unless you're only interested in the raw sex in 3D (but remember... it's more than 2 hours you have to sit through)."
Love,06-Nov-15,"Mild plot spoiler (and like any Noe movie I think you ought to just ignore any synopses or reviews and simply see it for yourself): this is the story of two lovers, how they meet, how their romance develops, how they learn about each others desires, their past relationships. Sex is a drug, and these characters are junkies. The first hit draws them in, and as they chase the dragon with each other, trying to make each hit as momentous as the last, their relationship evolves, blossoms, and suffers. The movie, set in Paris, moves non-chronologically through Murphy's (an American film student) recollection of his relationship with Electra, a French artist, both of them in their early or mid-20s. Scenes are strung together like jumbled photographs, pieces of each recalling or referencing another memory. The film is told from Murphy's point of view, and yet he's not a completely likable character, displaying huge streaks of jealousy and hypocrisy. Electra is mysterious at first, then we learn more as we go deeper into Murphy's memory.This is a visually beautiful movie. The lighting is dark but expressive, the framing of the scenes is exquisite, and scenes cut in and out like the blink of an eye. The opening scene is bold and erotic, but at the same time, tender and intimate. There is a lot of sex in this movie, but it's not there to be gratuitous. Each sex scene is different, portraying the desires and moods of the characters involved. Like many of Noe's movies an underlying theme is that of a stranger in a strange land. In Enter the Void, the characters are Americans in Tokyo. Here of course Murphy is struggling with his ability to handle a relationship with a French woman with more open ideas of commitment. It's not absolute though; her world is changed too by Murphy's interpretation of the very fluidity she seems to be encouraging. A particularly poignant part of of the movie has a sympathetic French policeman lecturing the hot-headed American Murphy on his aggressive and destructive attitudes about sex and relationships. At this point the officer is voicing a key part of what I think Noe's philosophy about love and sex. Murphy and Electra decide to take the officer's advice, but it doesn't quite work out as planned, and it's seems like Noe is saying, ""here is how I think it ought to be, and yet I could still be wrong.""At one point, Murphy asks a character what the best thing in life is, and the response without hesitation, is ""Love."" He follows up by asking what the second is. And without hesitation, the answer is, ""sex."" This movie is about love and sex, how they influence one another, and how they can destroy one another. There's a sense of humor running through the movie, which is expressed in several mild in- jokes about the director, and one particularly shocking (yet delightful: the audience at the screening I sat in erupted into happy cheers) use of 3D. It's not a movie for everyone, nevertheless it is quite a movie."
Love,02-Aug-15,"Contains some of the hottest sex scenes ever filmed, thanks to the combination of plausible courtship scenes, character development, and graphic (at least partially non-simulated) sex. Many of the sex scenes are beautiful to the point you become aware of the cinematography, though I did not feel aware of the acting at any point. A lot of the melodrama could have been edited out without impacting the plot whatsoever, not to mention some parts that are downright abusive to the viewer with blinding flashing lights, and, I suspect, some cheap abuse of 3D effects (I saw it in 2D), but then again this movie probably couldn't exist without giving the director a ton of editorial freedom. IMHO this is a must-see if you care at all about eroticism in film."
Love,30-Oct-15,"This film is literally a 90 minute porno hiding behind a 2 hour art film. Everything about it is bad. The editing is horrific, every single shot is separated by a half second of a pure black screen. The script is bad. BAAAD. No one has anything resembling a likable personality, there is no plot, the dialogue is stupid at best. The acting... well, these people weren't hired for their acting talent. They were hired because they were willing to get naked and have unsimulated sex on film. This film shows random sex scenes every chance it can. Also it's homophobic and transphobic, there is a scene played totally for laughs where the main guy freaks out over a transgendered woman. OH and if you're an epileptic, avoid this because the director seems to enjoy giving people seizures with random flashing lights.Literally the only thing about this that's in any way well done is the sex, and you can see better sex in actual porn films. Just go rent a porno, you'll get more enjoyment out of it and you won't have to deal with this horribly made 'film'."
Love,17-Nov-15,"... and no I am not talking about the characters in the film, I am talking about what happens when an A-list director ""falls in love"" with the idea of doing a sexually explicit film.I want to be clear about this and I think the data will bear me out. Make a list of all the films in the last 100 years by A-list directors who felt confident they could infringe on territory formerly occupied only by the porn industry and still prevail with a hit film...? Are you done? I will save you time. I did the list myself. And the answer is none, zero, zip, nada.Just like there are in the porn industry a handful of directors who constantly try to push the boundaries of their craft into the mainstream (which almost always means soft light and lots of white sheets, films that most resemble a commercial for TIDE) Noe, a brilliant artiste (Irreversible and Enter the Void were both brilliant) tried to push the envelope .. and ended up with junk mail.Sure, if you are determined to see a silk purse where others are seeing a sow's ear, you could pretend that this film has a great deal to say about men's expectations about love and marriage.But this is a review just between the writer and the reader, and we respect each other too much to lie. So I will be clear -- Noe went where angels fear to tread. And ended up with a film that, for posterity, is simply not going to make his A-reel."
Love,27-Dec-15,"As thought provoking and stylish as you'd expect. Kind of like a hybrid of Enter the Void, Nymphomaniac, The Lobster and Weekend. You can feel the love that has gone into this film.The sex is both beautiful and ugly. It's not porn, more like an aestheticized version of somebody's personal sex tape, but one designed to provoke contemplation more than any other response. To feel any more real it would need to be in the style of a documentary, which would have the effect of distancing you from the characters. I didn't feel like I was experiencing the story directly (as I do with good suspense movies), but I did want things to work out well for the characters. If you judge a movie by how much the pacing and suspense immerses you, you won't enjoy Love. If you can be immersed into a movie's atmosphere and want something to feed your imagination, then you will get a lot from it.A lot of reviews and comments on IMDb seem to say it is not a thought provoking movie, or that it is pretentious, yet the poster was moved to write about their thoughts on it, so it certainly isn't empty. I found talking about it can result in the conversation going to some very interesting places.It has earned a place in the history of cinema, and is hopefully a step away from the feelings of shame people feel about sex, a step towards greater freedom in art, culture and cinema."
Love,19-Mar-19,"Honestly, this is the first movie I ever watched from this director and I am amazed. I found his name by searching for directors similar to Nicolas Winding Refn.To get right to it, the opening scene is a little shocking but its cause I'm an american and used to movies not showing that stuff right off the bat. But it wasn't anything to get freaked out or something that would make me walk out of the theater.Once you get over the fact that it is sex then you start to analyse the scenes. Notice how Electra doesnt seem entirely there in the threesome. He is more into the other girl than her. I took this as a foreshadowing moment which this director did a lot of in the movie. Notice how its always sex with the two of them.Something that struck me was he always used the phone while standing in a doorway. This is another element to his character. It reveals a lot about their relationship as a hole.The music score is great and I picked up on the Pink Floyd songs. Another great attempt at foreshadowing.But, the one thing that really got me was the use of colours. Notice the red green orange and yellow that pops up from time to time. I believe red means pain, orange means love, green is fear and yellow is shy. The scene at the party where he messes around with the girl in the bathroom. Notice how the entire room is red and the bathroom is green. He is afraid at first to mess around with the girl because of Electra. But if you paid attention the scene prior when the two were talking to each other in front of Electra, they were in a red room and you couldn't help but feel the pain from electra as she had to watch him flirt.The entire movie is really about his narcissism and it plays well. I'd really like a sequel in which its in her point of view. To watch the same scenes over but get her thoughts would really make this come full circle."
Love,10-Feb-16,"I'm not going to waste a lot of time reviewing this... the IMDb description says Electra is unstable - sorry, nothing wrong with Electra... Murphy on the other hand is profoundly mentally ill. The movie should have been called ""Borderline Personality Disorder"". The writing is pure high school and Karl Glusman is as wooden as any slab rider on CSI. There is essentially no plot and none of the characters evokes any response in me - well maybe loathing for Murphy - what an (expletive) excretory orifice! His violence and his justification for his mindless violence - ""I'm an American an we fight for what's ours blah blah"" - the police don't stick him in jail but befriend him - what? He's with hot Electra and they go to a sex club - he has few women whilst there but loses his tiny mind when he finds her with a guy and a woman (a dream scenario) - hello stupid - it's Paris not Des Moines!! Why would you go/stay in Paris if you're a narrow minded pillock? This reviewing effort is far more than this abomination deserves - it's not even worth fast forwarding to the amateurish sex scenes (clearly directed by a 14 year old). In a just world this would be a career ender for all involved."
Love,20-Oct-18,"As a big admirer of Stanislavsky, I appreciate Gaspar Noe's approach in the sense of displaying life as it can really be. ""Love"" feels too melodramatic at times and some of the sex scenes seem a bit long. However, the overall mood and particularly the ambiguous conclusion serve as redeeming features. I was actually very moved by a scene close to the end, where Murphy's son comes into the bathroom and starts crying together with his father. I usually feel annoyed when I hear children crying, but Noe showed me something that I felt truly empathetic about: a child who intuitively felt the grief of his father and them grieving together and consoling each other - it all feels very natural. By the time I got to the end of the film, I've experienced catharsis, and that's the reason I'd recommend experiencing this movie at least once."
Love,16-Jul-18,"Overly ambitious project about a millennial love arc that ends in heartbreak, but what are the lessons learned? Murphy (Karl Glusman) is an open-minded film student in Paris who meets Elektra (Aomi Muyock), and the two embrace their high sex drives with giddyness. However, after the relationship embraces polyamory and swingers culture, only one of the two is emotionally stable enough to handle it.The film is directed really well by Noé, who by now should know well enough how to make it all super claustrophobic and uncomfortable for the viewer. The cinematography is good but relies too heavily on saturation but it's never really an issue. Nonlinear storytelling is clear, concise, and there's some really neat editing at parts. The story does drag often, and the film overall could've cut out 10-15 minutes of filler.The real issue with ""Love"" is the lack of chemistry between Murphy and Elektra -- we just don't see it, pretty much ever. The writing is there, but the actors just cannot grasp it. This is largely because -- are you ready? -- they aren't actors; Noé met both Glusman and Muyock in a club one night and asked them to star. It's clear that he wanted to achieve the most organic and natural relationship dynamic on-screen by not using ""real actors"" -- but in what is supposed to be an emotionally charged film, that just doesn't work.In fact, in a sort of disturbingly surreal manner, the very same issues that the film is trying to highlight in millennial relationships (emotional maturity and boundaries over sex) seem to show up in the unsimulated sex scenes between Glusman and Muyock. Glusman constantly falls out of character, allowing his own sexual desire to ruin the scene and any emotional impact Noé was looking for. Muyock seems bored and uninterested -- and who could blame her? -- likely due to Glusman's obvious zeal about getting paid to fuck her. I'm not sure he entirely understood the fact he was in an art film, and in remaining ignorant, he ends up verifying Noé's entire thesis: young adults, especially men, get lost in the idea of sexual nirvana over the thing that truly matters: love.The second half of the film lifts the veil on Murphy's narcissistic and emotionally abusive behavior in the relationship, and tragically, Glusman is a good actor when portraying an unstable douchebag (and Muyock is phenomenal when screaming at him).The film finishes the same place it starts, seeming to depict Murphy at rock-bottom in a horrible and accidental family dynamic: a fitting bookend to a relationship that was destroyed not by too much sex, but his own fear of it. The ending is eerie and powerful, and hints at the generational ripples that will be felt for decades because of his own actions. It's a great story, and sort of well-acted, but it ends up merely tripping up on its own interpretation of reality instead of offering us anything particularly new."
Love,28-Nov-15,"Well the movie is really different, i felt sad for the main male character with his behavior, the sex scenes are really strong but not from another world, I was not horny, in any sex scene, i just see trying to understand the director point of view, and i hope i did understand this...natural,humans,sex,internet,porn,bisexual and a lot of other things that is happening and will happen in the future, i liked the movie and I did not like, i am giving 7 because the director did a really great job to express the reality of the movie love,behavior,choices and sex. Excellent cinematography, average performance / odd of the actors, good soundtrackof course. My Opinion i am not the master of cinema, but i don't undestard why credential critics give so many bad talk of this movie, i am sure some of they watched/watch porn and/or do sex."
Love,13-Mar-16,"Let's face it. Somehow this thing got legitimized by using more expensive film and hi tech movie equipment. I can just see the guys sitting there drooling because this is somehow a mainstream movie. ""Look, dear. This is an art film like the ones you are always talking about. I really don't see anything more than a bunch of explicit sex which I could pick up at any adult movie outlet if I wanted to. Of course, it could have been redeemed if there had been something new about it. The problem is that it is just plain boring. The characters are tiresome and unappealing. The plot is virtually nonexistent. Yes, there is a bit of decent cinematography, but even that is pretentious and ""artsy."" It takes away the simple presentation of the story (such as it is), and when these flashy scenes show up, they are just such obvious eye candy. Don't bother."
Love,04-Mar-16,"are these people crazy or what i mean what in the blue hell is this how is this even called a film & how did it get released i like erotic films but this is just pure garbage.love 2015 is a desperate attempt by the makers to sell porn in the name of art sadly it fails.love is a wrong title this film should have been called lust,films like these that justify wrong things in society should be banned.this is some sick fantasy or a pervert thats it there is no story in this film just sex and vulgarity what can you say about a film that opens with a hand job scene that lasts for 5 minutes.after watching this filth my reaction was crazy i wondered for a long time about what was the reaction of people who saw this in the theaters,can you imagine only.the main characters are biggest cheats ever the whole 2 hours they are having sex,clubbing & then more sex.the camera-work is lousy,music sucks & acting oh please don't ask all of the actors were terrible.i am believing for once second that someone actually wrote a script for this nonsense.if you want a better film try some of those Shannon Tweed soft core movies from 90s decade or if you want hardcore simply buy porn but stay away from this stupidity.Love 2015 has nothing to see if you enjoy crass cheap cinema then this is for you my rating is 1/10,its a waste of time and money.Skipp it"
The Outpost,06-Jul-20,"I did two combat deployments to Afghanistan and one to Iraq. I can tell you without a doubt this movie is the most accurate representation of FOB/COP life, soldier lingo, and to an extent the combat.Most reviews I've read complain of sub-par dialogue and not a clear story as to what was going on prior to the attack, but I bet that most of the reviews were from people who have never been to war. In war Dialogue between soldiers is not interesting, it's dark, unfiltered, and usually disgusting. We degrade each other, fight each other, we say things so offensive and disgusting that most people would think we have issues. In war you also don't always have a clear cut mission that you can make into some grand Hollywood story. When you deploy you are supposed to find bad guys and help locals, that's it. Those hoping war has some interesting story will be disappointed. You sit around bored, exhausted, missing home, working out, eating garbage food, piss in tubes/bottles (first movie I've seen that showed the bottles), burn your own crap, watch movies, go on patrol and maybe get shot at. Every so often you get a big mission where the combat gets intense. Then it's rinse and repeat, that's how it is and I'm sure prior to the attack, that's how life on Keating was. This movie depicts life in the military so accurately that I was like ""my gosh finally someone did it, they got it right it"". So to anyone reading this, this is as real as you'll find it until something else is made. All those who talk smack about it are idiot keyboard warriors.The combat itself is good, explosions look real even the CGI ones were ok, none of that dumb fireball explosion crap, the dust and smoke generated from shooting and explosions to the point the soldiers in the movie were coughing from it was legit. Now I wasn't in this battle but I've been in my fair share of fights I can tell you that tracer rounds aren't as fruitful as you see here. Most of the time you get shot at an have no idea where it came from except maybe a general direction. Muzzle flashes also are hard to see unless it's at night and you could see them all over in this movie. Usually you just see dust or smoke from where they shot, not flashes. But Hollywood has to do this for the effect as it does makes firefights look cool and without seeing tracer bullets whiz by it takes away from the intensity.
Also the soldiers were able to yell and talk to each other from long distances. Yea that doesn't happen, war is ungodly loud, you have to be screaming in a dudes ear to hear you.
When the air support showed up finally, how it was being controlled didn't make sense, but that's just me being nit picky as not many people know what the hell is going on with that.
The tactics were decent, you could tell there was some military advising for sure but some things didn't make sense. Not sure if that's how it happened or just Hollywood though.Overall if you want to watch the most realistic depiction of how the war in Afghanistan is, this is it. To all the naysayers saying this is garbage, hate the way the soldiers talk to each other, or wish there was a more clear story/mission, you obviously have never been there.RIP to all the fallen in this battle"
The Outpost,04-Jul-20,"PREMISE - The Outpost depicts the battle of Outpost Keating, known as the Battle of Kamdesh, which took place on October 3rd 2009, close to the border with Pakistan in Afghanistan. The Outpost itself was located on the bend of a river in a valley, completely overlooked by high mountains on all sides. It was simply put, a nigntmare to defend and a prime target to over run. So it would be that 300 Taliban fighters would attempt to do just that over two fateful days that October.
In addition to the harsh terrain the location had other issues. Helicopter re-supply was extremely challenging and dangerous and could only be conducted at night (A previous re-supply attempted killed 12 people, not depicted in the movie) meaning only night landings when there was no moon were possible. Due the nature of the base being located effectively in the bottom of a funnel, in-direct fire support from artillary was impossible and the nearest close air-support was thirty minutes away. Into this nightmare scenario 53 American Soldiers were expected to defend the worst position possible, so the stage was set for a modern day Zulu and one of the bloodiest close quarter conflicts of the war in Afghanistan.THE CAST - Casting here is impressive and suspiciously full of the children and grandchildren of famous actors and directors. (Jagger, Gibson, Eastwood, Attenborough) Knowing full well that it is difficult to often tell men apart in uniform during depictions of conflict on screen, we have an interesting range of faces, the most easy to spot of which is SCOTT EASTWOOD, proving to be every bit his Father's son as Staff Sgt Clint Romesha, he and CALEB LANDRY JONES both give stand out performances but the rest of the cast are solid too, special mentions to: CORY HARDRICT, TAYLOR JOHN SMITH. and the ever dependable JACK KESY. Senior Officers are played by MILO GIBSON (Whose making a good name for himself despite the challenge of having to fill size 22 shoes) and ORLANDO BLOOM, who appears to have come full circle from playing PFC Blackburn in Blackhawk Down to playing Captain Keating here, whom the camp was ultimately named after. A number of younger British actors do incredibly well and even Producer JOHNATHAN YUNGER gets in on the action!PRODUCTION - The film was predominantly shot in Bulgaria, as you would expect for a film being produced by Millenium Pictures, but the set up for the camp is convincing and adequately conveys the issues facing the defenders, although the depiction of the terrain is slightly different. The first half of the film tells the story of the various officers who were stationed at the camp before leaving the final third of the film to depict the battle. It is here where ex-soldier turned director ROD LURIE and DOP LORENZO SENATORE do a superb job of giving us a balls to the wall depiction of the final assault and place you firmly in the middle of it, making me regret I could not have experienced the sequence on the big screen. Several long takes (all the rage these days) give a very realistic depiction of following one character in the battle, then another. They also employ a clever techique of depicting the deaths of the real personnel involved, seen primarily form the third person, which felt like a sensible and sensitive approach to the issue in question. One of the most dependable sargeants is wounded early on during the firefight which has an impact on the battle morale of the soldiers whom find themselves fighting for their lives minute by minute. Enough screen time is given to depicting the local political problems facing the American officers, who did their best under extremely challenging circumstances to placate locals.OVERALL - This film is one of the best depictions of close quarter fighting since Blackhawk Down and is extremely well handled. Some of the earlier dialogue between the soldiers lets the film down a little bit. Yes, we know soldiers do talk like this from time to time but some of lines are cringeworthy to say the least and I am sure this dialogue could have easily been improved upon, but minor gripes aside the film is a pretty gripping depiction of a stupid military blunder which cost the lives of several young men, completely unnecessarily. It does seem a shame however, that the release of this film, may have torpedoed a second film on the subject (RED PLATOON) based on the book written by Medal of Honour winner Clinton Romesha (Played by Scott Eastwood) - Eastwood was not able to speak to Romesha when researching the role he depicted due to this conflict which feels a real shame. So it is possible, we might see a second film depicting the battle. Bring it on."
The Outpost,13-Jul-20,"Very much in the mold of Zulu (1964). Love the realism of being in a real war, with ammunition and bombs going off left, right and center, and soldiers forced on extreme survival skills to battle incredible odds. Some fort - surrounded on all sides by mountains. Outpost is 100% certified as a feminist-free GUY popcorn-movie. Was going to give it a 7, but, in the light of that, think I'll give it an 8."
The Outpost,05-Jul-20,"This is a great movie. Indeed there are, but there are a couple of great things about it:this was a movie based on true eventsthe action scenes are exciting and provide an engaging visual fellingthere is no sugar coating, the actions depicted on the movie real and truthfulIt follows a similar line to 13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi, which I liked a lot too. The storytelling around the lives of each soldier are built differently, but the goal here is not to explore the lives of each of them, but to understand the challenges of fighting a war in a place clearly indefensible. There are no protections against the mountains and everyone knows it, even the viewer as you get the first glimpse of the environment the soldiers were put in.I recommend this movie and I think you will like it if you also like movie based on true events."
The Outpost,03-Jul-20,"Very accurately captures how soldiers interact with one another. The trailer worried me with a few ""Hollywood"" sounding one-liners but the dialogue, action sequences and genuine experience make it very authentic. I really enjoy how the film highlights the various leadership styles and approaches from those in command. This is a great film that I hope gets more attention 9/10."
The Outpost,04-Jul-20,"I thought this would be a B movie, but it is actually really good. It is truly intense, and brings you to the outpost where you feel threatened and desperate. I really enjoyed it."
The Outpost,21-Jul-20,"There are a few war-film cliches, but that doesn't make the those scenes unrealistic. And the rest is (to this non-soldier) very real! I don't see how this could have been done better. The actors go all-out, the direction is taut, the action almost non-stop, the effects convincing. Well worth a watch if the subject doesn't simply depress you too much."
The Outpost,19-Jul-20,"This was very well made. Some soldiers that were on the battle participated as actors, giving it even more realism. All actors did an amazing job. They made me stick my eyes to the screen and not blink until the movie was over. The sound engineering was insanely good, as well as the post-production editing. I will not spoil the battle to anyone reading, but I can say that my heart was pumping like I was there.
Great job!I don't understand how this movie has less than 7 stars and also why garbage insignificant ""woke"" movies have the same rating as this one.
Wake up."
The Outpost,07-Jul-20,"This movie (despite its occasional poor reviews) is fantastic. On a film basis, the movie does a great job introducing you to characters you'd want to learn the true story of. I read the book by Clinton Romesha (depicted by Scott Eastwood) last year entitled ""Red Platoon"" and always had an interest in learning more about the events that unfolded that day. This movie, in my opinion, did the book justice. As far as filmography is concerned, it was great. Realistic action, gunfire, explosions, etc. that youd expect to see in a war movie. The added aspect of realism was the trauma that you can see in the actors portrayal of their characters eyes that can only be a glimpse into what they experienced. Watch the movie, read the book, or vice-versa. Just remember the names."
The Outpost,12-Jul-20,"I waited a while before I watched this due the negative reviews on the internet but after seen it I just don't understand thise people.Okay, maybe it's slow in the beginning and there's a lot of scene's you think well, why and how and please explain but once things go wrong at the outpost this is a hell of a movie.Scott Eastwood. in the dark, his eyes and voice are really lik eclint. Said that, back to this flick based on true events. The cruelty of war is shown, friendship and death are so close. Effects are just on the edge of goredom.If you can sit throughout the first 45 minutes then this is really a good movie.
Gore 1/5
Nudity 0/5
Effects 3/5
Story 5/5
Comedy 0/5"
The Outpost,11-Jul-20,"I didn't even know this movie was being made, but I first heard about it when it was touted as a ""pro-America military movie."" I wasn't exactly sure what that meant, but it sounded better than the alternative.I served in Operation Enduring Freedom 7 and 8, in a little Forward Operating Base called FOB Tillman, named after Army Ranger Pat Tillman who died in that area (Paktika Province of Afghanistan, a few kilometers from the Paki border). We were one small Infantry company (A Company, 2/87) in a remote area, which was populated by neutral locals and Taliban forces. The American media called it a ""hot zone,"" and it was. The similarities between the setting in The Outpost and the reality of my unit's experiences are startling. Obviously, I'm a biased reviewer.That being said: I thought this movie was incredible! There were a couple of things I questioned the accuracy of, like soldiers firing full-auto M4s and the somewhat casual behavior of soldiers in an obvious death trap; but overall this movie gets just about everything right. Down to the small details like the water bottle used as counterweights to keep the exterior doors closed, and the local Afghan elder with the red dye in his beard. Those are the kinds of details that SO many Hollywood interpretations overlook. Also, the story this movie relates is an incredible tale of heroism, sacrifice and brotherhood, which really are common in the US military. Watching this film was a cathartic experience for me, as well as an enjoyable movie-going one."
The Outpost,03-Jul-20,"Never rated Scott Eastwood thought he was a subpar actor but man was I wrong he is amazing in this movie he shines and was without a shadow of a doubt my favourite character, as for the rest of the cast they all put in an amazing performance and the movie in a whole is just excellent, I love a good war movie and this is just that, trust me just watch it"
The Outpost,05-Jul-20,"War movies tend to get it really bad, or get it really right. This one gets it right.More of a docu-drama, than a narrative film, and non-stop ""WTF"" in your face the entire time. You instantly feel for the soldiers who were based in one of the most ill-conceived camps known. The ominous sense of dread and foreboding haunts the first few minutes of the film.There are plenty of ""gotcha"" moments where you think a certain soldier is going to be with you the entire film, only to discover they are not. It's jarring and keeps you on your toes the entire time.The handheld cameras are shaky, but not overly so, and bring you right into the terror that was that fierce battle.Every actor delivers a satisfactory performance, but it is Caleb Landry Jones who delivers an Oscar-worthy performance as Ty Carter. An incredible portrayal which required careful nuance, it's one of the best pieces of casting direction I've seen in a long time.A truly incredible film that will tear you apart, ""The Outpost"" quickly rises to the my top 25 all-time war films ever made."
The Outpost,18-Jul-20,"This is a war film based on a true story. It takes place at an indefensible base in Kamdesh surrounded by mountains, They are targeted on a daily basis. The soldiers are required to be diplomats to the people shooting at them. Of course, being sitting ducks invites a major confrontation. The film was realistic. You didn't know who would live or die from the start other than Scott Eastwood and Orlando Bloom. They get paid too much to die in the first scene. The film does not make any political statements. It does show the horror of war in such a way as to question it.Guide: F-word. Male butt nudity."
The Outpost,04-Jul-20,This one was hard to watch as a combat vet. I read the book and knew what was going to happen and it still hit hard. The first part of the film was necessary to show life in Army. Yes the dialogue is not PC and civilians may think the behavior is unprofessional. Those boys were very good at their jobs don't worry. Military humor down range is far from PC and Soldiers do a good job in finding humor in almost anything. The final battle is incredible and watching these Soldiers react and make plans under incredible pressure and chaos is amazing. The acting is great and Scott Eastwood was impressive as Romesha.
The Outpost,04-Jul-20,"I've been watching war movies since the fifties and this is the most rousing-harrowing-insane-based on a real-alamo event war movie I've seen.
Which up till now was the last third of ""Come and See"".
For me, this is essentially the Afghan version of ""ZULU"".
The criticism that the movie doesn't develop the 'minor' squad members is patently ridiculous. The movie is ABOUT them. If anything, this shows why you maybe shouldn't: it hurts when the stuff hits the fan and boy does it hit hard.
A deserved heavy weight of poignance pervades the credits.
Excellent work by Caleb Landry Jones.
Scott Eastwood's DNA causes him to appear to be doing a weak imitation of Clint."
The Outpost,19-Jul-20,I seldom write reviews here but this movie deseves some credit.It was a long time since I saw such good war movie. Good story and visuals. Watch it you will not be dissapointed.
The Outpost,03-Jul-20,"Because this is made for the unison , and not the bipartisan of the audience. its a film about usa's war on taliban in afghanistan, it has a very cliched build up with loads of rough and tough language and bullying among compadres en masse. that really is going on for ssome 45 minutes.but when the heat gets hot, i guess youll experience some highraised shoulders and stiffness in the neck, because the ''under attack'' action parts a really dignyfying and deadly to say the least, thanks to handheld free motion camerawork ,so here youre in for some good moviemaking.but there are much mediocreness in the quiet and spiritual moments of the story, and that makes the grumpy old man give just a 7.but if you like the topic and genre, its among the finest made over the subject, and some of the acting are pretty good."
The Outpost,04-Jul-20,"This film shows that each soldier is fighting for the person beside them. Shows the madness of working with people that don't want you there, and the incredible relief when the battle is over. Some people may see this as a fairy tale of toxic masculinity. Those people do not know the immense joy of being shot at and missed."
The Outpost,18-Jul-20,"Hris movie hit hard to any Vet out there that has been in the thick of things, have lost friends, and has know that they may not come home from the tour. If you thought the opening of Saving privates Ryan was impressive, this is that but for 2 hours long. Highly recommend the movie."
The Outpost,21-Jul-20,"""The Outpost"" is surprisingly a well executed, well acted and intense film about the war in Afghanistan. I was hooked from beginning to end.
.
In this war drama based on a true story, a small team of U.S. soldiers battle against hundreds of Taliban fighters in Afghanistan.
.
Director Rod Lurie takes the viewers inside the outpost rarely ever showing the enemy but always showing the bond between brothers. Scott Eastwood and Caleb Landry Jones are terrific in their roles and the action sequences are pulse-pounding. I started this review off with the word ""surprising""; and being a B-movie I didn't expect much from ""The Outpost"". Turns out I was wrong and you should see this film.
.
Follow @snobmedia for all reviews!"
The Outpost,04-Jul-20,"I felt like I was playing Call of Duty for 5 hours. A mishmash of battles and irrelevant dialogue, for a basic mission. Sadly, I wasn't participating in this conflict. The realism was excellent, although heavily drawn out by a screenplay that needed to be much tighter. The casting was excellent and I felt although not all performances where great, they were convincingly real and emotional. It's not your typical Hollywood war film, but instead one of true grit war films that honors the real life soldiers that were KIA or able to return home. Your eyes will be glued to the screen, but you'll be left unsatisfied with the overall storytelling."
The Outpost,04-Jul-20,The movie portrays the suffering of young men sent to a part of world they don't understand just because someone on top was too dumb to know better .
The Outpost,20-Jul-20,"Well, I really felt so touched and the movie is so great with bravery.
However, the events were so realistic."
The Outpost,03-Jul-20,"I'm not going to discuss the political aspects of this film, as it deals with them with about as much insight as John Wayne and The Green Berets does the Vietnam conflict. This film is rather more a memorial to some very brave US soldiers who lost their lives through monumental command stupidity when a 'hearts and minds' US Military Outpost was placed (even to my militarily-untrained eye) in the most ridiculous location in Afghanistan (or indeed the entire Middle East), as was apparently acknowledged both before and after the event by the US Military themselves.
Based on a true story, the film is basically a record of repeated attacks on the outpost by the Taliban, and the soldiers' attempts to defend the indefensible, interspersed with the usual soldierly chit-chat and team-building.
I'm not entirely convinced that the real soldiers (US Cavalry veterans) who died would be entirely happy with the way their Hollywood counterparts portrayed them - for example, that no serious effort was made to secure or patrol the surrounding heights throughout the repeated attacks, even though the attacks always came from the same place. Furthermore, the soldiers are presented as chiefly concerned with the chit-chat instead of being careful - like keeping to cover, and not strolling across an IED-lined river bridge chatting happily to your mate.
For the first three quarters of the movie, the firefights are chiefly of soldiers shooting at an apparently empty hillside, and it difficult to feel compassion when someone gets killed because they are all in the same camo and helmets and you can't really tell who's who. This is something the director obviously realised post-production, as the film is heavily overlaid with titles saying who is who, and also where they are (as the location is also pretty samey). However, in the effort to be fair to all the combatants, there are just too many to remember, and the only one who really sticks is Clint Eastwood Junior, sporting a ridiculous moustache.
The barrack-room backchat is heavily-scripted, un-funny and generally pointless, adding to the difficulty in caring about the characters. It may be that this is real US army-talk - regardless, it isn't entertaining to listen to.
The firefights are confusing and, I suspect, grittily realistic. Unfortunately, this makes them unsatisfactory to watch as you, the viewer, have no more idea what's going on, where the enemy is, or who is shooting at who, than the soldiers themselves.
In summary, the film is a sound memorial to the soldiers who died and an excellent lesson for West Point in military stupidity - but as a war-film it lacks a sharp script, necessary character development, any real insight into the Afghan conflict, or the kind of close direction required for complex battle sequences to be comprehensible."
Peninsula,17-Jul-20,"Allowing this movie to air on the big screen, is an outright insult to the viewers. This is a half-assed, textbook case of milking a successful movie (Train to Busan) into a poor ""sequel"".I can write a book about the plot holes, inconsistensies and the movies being impossible for the viewers to suspend their disbelief to take it seriously.There are extended segments of painfuly edgy teen/toddler duo. Where they exchange one liners and run over infected in a ""stylish"" way. All the while they slam into other cars while drifting and grind against building/cars anime style. All the while, without sustaining as much as a scratch to the car's paint, and not even a splash of blood...Even better, nearly 1/4th of the movie is composed of these EXTREMELY poorly made CGI sections and car chases (yay?). For some reason these scenes dominate the majority of the movie.This is all so (masterfully ?) Integrated with an overwhelming amount of EXTENDED ""sad"" slow motion shots of ""dramatic"" situation about underdeveloped characters that you couldn't care less about, dying or ""almost"" dying but being saved at the last second. Rambo-style by the invincible main protagonist.This movie is utter trash, unbelievably so. I can't recall the last time where i had such an overwhelming urge, to storm out of the theater, and demand a refund.Do your a huge favour and dodge this bullet that i took for you. AVOID THIS MOVIE. Don't worry, the name aside, this movie has NOTHING to do with Train to Busan. So you are not missing out."
Peninsula,15-Jul-20,"When Train to Busan hit theaters, it became a sensational hit for the right reasons. It manages to become an enjoyable blockbuster yet with smart social commentary and emotional moments that (I need to admit) made me cry. 4 years later, Peninsula - the sequel - hit the theaters with high ambition but fail to reach the height of its predecessor as it falls into the ordinary sequel trap.4 years after the events of Train to Busan, a former marine, Jung-Seok (Gang Dong-won) must return and retrieve something at now-abandoned Korea in order to be accepted by the society outside their homeland. I really appreciate how they took a new approach to the zombie sequels with a new setting. However, bigger doesn't always mean better as the world-building lacked in the concept details of that never reach the tension felt in its predecessor.Perhaps the above reason can't be blame due to its small yet important component: characters. A large number of characters also resulted in less screen-time, making it hard to have in-depth sympathy with the characters. The characters also felt flat with its two-dimensional personality, making it hard for the characters to be likable even when the actors have given their best to portray them. As a result, it lacks emotional attachment and even scares to deliver.Still, I can't deny on how much entertaining Peninsula has to offer. Yeon Sang-ho's use of camerawork and how he directs the action sequence make the film watchable. I preferably like the first chase scene with zombies and the survival game. The survival game especially, really showcases his direction with his one-take. The visual style could be deemed as unique as well, showing abandoned Korea as dirty and chaotic yet beautifully eye-catching. Although I need to say that the CG in its car scene is extremely rough that you somehow looking more of a video game than a live-action film.Overall, Peninsula is could never reach its predecessor quality as a smart blockbuster with a high emotional level. However, its entertainment value, if almost, could still reach what it had left 4 years ago. Just don't expect too much to use your brain and have fun as you visit Peninsula."
Peninsula,16-Jul-20,"Its really really bad, it's more like a racing movie then anything else, the whole movie was done using vfx."
Peninsula,15-Jul-20,Just saying.. There is no train in this movie at all just a lot of cars..its not a sequel to the first movie just using the same pandemic that's started in Korea...This movie has a very different vibe from the first movie... it is not really a survival zombie movie like the first one..no really thrilling zombie scene compared to the first one.. more to war between humans with car racing and guns..There are some questionable facts in this movie such as a mother who let her kids riding cars like that ..and a really young girl who can drive like that is too good to be true.. a group of people survived that long but did not in anyway try to contact the outside world? But instead capture people and have fun watching them being killed by zombies..Did not really feel anything when some of the characters died.. There are some forced drama like the death of his brother in law which I don't really care.. Because not much bond can be felt between them.. There is also added drama towards the end that suppose to make me feel something but instead felt clichéd..
Peninsula,21-Jul-20,Generally it is a movie about driving skill instead of zombies.
Peninsula,16-Jul-20,"Not thrilled at all n not scary at all.
Not touching at all as well. It's becoming similar to maze runner story a bit but worst.
Too much graphics throughout the movie.
Doesn't feel its a zombie movie anymore.
Was expecting a nice sequel from part 1 which was superb well done."
Peninsula,18-Jul-20,"It's totally different from train to busan. The worst part is the plot which looks like anyhow write up. No firm structure. Feels like watching a racing or shooting scenes movie instead of zombie vs humans. It seems totally unrelated to the structure of train to busan and this movie just try to get people's attention under the name of so called ""train to busan"" film. Not worth to waste the time watching it."
Peninsula,24-Jul-20,"That should be the title. I am VERY surprised this was selected for Cannes. This movie still got the K-Drama vibe but lacked the thriller and shock value of the first one - even for a tiny bit. Nada. It's like they tried too hard to appeal to western viewers and ended up producing a film that the Hollywood fanatics themselves would stomp on. It was just horrible. But I expected too much because you know, 4 years from Train to Busan!I suggest that if you don't want anything to do with the first movie and want some human to human plot with zombies on the side then you can probably sit through this movie. I just lingered on hoping something interesting will happen but the whole miserable 2 hours just failed me. Really disappointed and sad that they weren't able to live up to the first movie. I hope we can all just pretend this movie never happened and wish they will make a part 3 which is more connected or has the feels of the first one. But I guess when you kill Gong Yoo in the movie then it's all downhill from there.The car racers who likes to scare themselves to sleep with thoughts of zombie outbreaks will probably love this though."
Peninsula,24-Jul-20,"Peninsula is an extremely fun movie to watch. It packs virtually all genres possible, the movie is way too much but very entertaining. You have zombies (although they are not really threatening and felt more like a tool used to advance the plot), you have Mad Max-like car chases, you have wild insane people enjoying the Purge, you have a hint of a comedy and a whole lot of soap opera drama. At one point I was convinced the characters would start dancing Bollywood-style!
While Train to Busan was character-driven and emotional film, Peninsula is a wild, action-packed movie which has almost nothing to do with the former. It would fit perfectly into Zombieland universe and the reviews here would be much better then. In other words, it is a bad movie if you expect Train to Busan continuation but a good Zombieland 3.
Plot-wise, Peninsula leaves even more question unanswered, if you think about characters' background or some story details you'll notice a lot of inconsistencies, plot holes and unclarities. But this movie is not made to think, so don't take it seriously, don't expect much and just enjoy whatever nonsense is going on on-screen."
Peninsula,18-Jul-20,"After watching, I felt like I was watching John Wick+Fast & Furious. When the main character talk, the zombie will stop and waiting :)"
Peninsula,22-Jul-20,"As much as I love the first movie, I expected more from this sequel but I have to admit that it was a bit boring in my opinion. there's not much action like the first one where they were being chased by the zombies. as this movie takes place 4 years after the first one, it is more about human vs human, just like how it is when u watch the walking dead. they moved on from fighting zombies."
Peninsula,20-Jul-20,"The reason first movie worked was because it had a heart. It's almost cruel how much the film tugged at your heartstrings.Train to Busan wastes no time getting to the point, the build up only takes a few brief scenes, then the madness captivates the rest. We see the outbreak from beginning, middle and end within the narrative's run time. You have time to develop empathy for each character, their backstories, and connections to one another fleshed out in small bursts throughout the film. While the human condition is in question, the narrative also explores societal themes, which are all perfectly juxtaposed with gory yet skillfully crafted action sequences.This movie on the other hand may as well be directed by Michael Bay with pointless action and explosions. It tries too hard to be like Hollywood action movies and it shows. I will pretend this movie never happened."
Peninsula,20-Jul-20,"Easy plot. Lazy storyline, more action than zombie. Final act this movie like watching fast and furious movie."
Peninsula,17-Jul-20,"This movie has changed from zombie to action/racing.It is action-packed but the chemistry between human and zombie is almost down to none. The zombies are just mere tools for the characters instead of threats. The death of some characters are also far-fetched.In short:
Action: 7/10
Zombie/Horror: 3/10
Story: 5/10
Music: 7/10"
Peninsula,18-Jul-20,"It is very slow and boring! Pace is very disrupted and it makes audience cannot connect with even one of the main characters, u won't be crying for sure !!"
Peninsula,20-Jul-20,"1st movie i had after Circuit Breaker, rating it lower than 1/10 if possible.The story plot are poor, CGI's was poor, especially the scene that 2 teen/toddler driving in such 'stylish' way (Fast and Furious seriously ?) to run over those infected, wonder who the hell teach the teen such driving skills, don't even talk about where the heck they get the petrol for car for 4 years, what a joke!The scene in Hong Kong is ridiculous and they don't even making effort to hire real local Hong Kong people, actors speak poor Cantonese who acting as local Hong Kong people/ gangsters.This is the first movie i had where i want to get out from the cinema! This movie is a big NO NO."
Peninsula,19-Jul-20,I think it's very entertaining. I found the storyline so intriguing.
Peninsula,21-Jul-20,"I liked this movie,was good & entertaining but those people not liked this movie reason comparing this movie with first part( first part was masterpiece,Authentic,Fresh story,korean style touch,potray human emotions in depth ) but this movie seems liked watch hollywood typical action movie,i hoped this movie story will be unique with authentic korean touch ,its was better if director follow korean orignality rather then hollywood style"
Peninsula,20-Jul-20,"It was okey from the start till the end, but the last part!! its just unbelievable stupid!!the slow motion, i just had to do a face palm, from that scene..aigooo!for the writer and director who wrote and direct this, you should have done better, im always been a fan of kdrama since early 2000 but this one is far from my favorite, far from the train to busan with gong yo.. Anyways enjoy"
Peninsula,19-Jul-20,"Another typical zombie apocalypse cliche movie where the bad guys are annoyingly screaming constantly for no reason. the only relation to train of busan is korean zombies. also, please hire actors that can actually speak proper cantonese/mandarin in movies."
Peninsula,28-Jul-20,"In fact, if you think about it carefully, why the first part is so successful, it is not difficult to conclude why the second part has such a tragic reputation.1. The first theme is about survival, fighting between people and zombies, while the second one is reduced to a melee between gangs. The screenwriter wants to learn the American TV drama TWD. Unfortunately, the movie can't make the American drama Negan's ruthlessness. A group of third-rate gangsters occupy the mountain as king.2. The first flight basically relied on legs. This one basically popularized off-road vehicles. Basically everyone must have a talent for drift racing. Your death can only show that your car skills are not good enough. This greatly weakens the atmosphere of terror. I thought I was watching Fast and Furious 9! It's a bit like Mad Max 4.3. The reason for the success of the first film is that the love between father and son runs through the whole story. The second one can be regarded as the role of a separate stove. It is a pity that the male protagonist has become a soy saucer, who looks like Ekin Cheng, but unfortunately there is no line in the whole process."
Peninsula,28-Jul-20,"This movie is set 4 years after Train to Busan (2016). Back then Train to Busan was hit international, everybody loves and talks a lot about the movie. That movie was like a rollercoaster, where you literally can't stop watching it until the end. Simple story, the pacing is great and the ending is good.This year, they released a sequel to Train to Busan, which is took place after 4 years, but none of the characters from the first film return. Which is completely different character but same universe.Sadly, Peninsula is not as great as Train to Busan because the story is so much like you see in Hollywood. The story is about a crime boss used Koreans as mercenary to take a large sum of money in Korea, but they failed horribly when they got ambushed by a group of survivor where they got abandoned during the outbreak.The movie slowly became Mad Max during the third act, where all the survivors are chasing the main character.Like I said, the movie lost its touch because I believe most audience come here to watch human vs zombies, not human vs human, we got tired with this storyline, man.And again, I just it 6/10 because the action sequence was good, some of the characters was great especially the main lead.Ps: the character Jane was so cringeworthy. Her acting is so unnatural, and her dialogue was literally recite from the script"
Peninsula,27-Jul-20,A child-like TV movie - think Dukes of Hazard - meets a poor Mad Max. the action is not paced and it's all very predictable/unbelievable. only watch if you are under 21.
Peninsula,23-Jul-20,"Very disappointed with this movie. Abuse tricks, too easy to guess the situation, many irrational details. The main scene is like a short version of Fast and Furious"
Peninsula,19-Jul-20,I expected more than this when i heard that the movie was taken to the Cannes film festival.
The F**k-It List,08-Jul-20,"This movie feels like it was wrote by a teenager. It is so melodramatic and self pitying, it is a disaster.The main character is just so annoying and I don't even know. The opening scene told me everything about this character. His parents had left him post it notes all over the house because he clearly can't do anything by him self. But apparently he is the best teenager to have ever graced this earth so confusing.There is just so much petulant behaviour it's so bad. He ends up loosing his places at collage because he blew up a school. There is no involvement of the police which once again is confusing. He then proceeds to record the most manic video about wanting to do things he wish he had done.This is just so bratty and spoilt. He takes no responsibility about blowing up a school because he was being a stupid child.Then when he is sad he sits and sulks in his back garden pool. I mean can he be anymore relatable.Everything is just teeny and just oblivious to the real world.The speech at the end. Jesus. It feels like it was wrote by a child who has been sent to his room after being told off. ""Mom you just don't understand me"". It's just trash.It is 100% made for teenagers but it shouldn't be because it is like telling them to be like ""drop out of college and just fart around doing nothing if you want to"" that is not a good message.In someways it's like a bad version of Booksmart (2019) in ways like he wants to do things he has missed out on doing. But booksmart handles it in such a good way and you like the characters because they are well drawn and thought out.So in conclusion watch Booksmart"
The F**k-It List,05-Jul-20,"Not relatable unless your parents own millions, I guess."
The F**k-It List,05-Jul-20,"What an interesting time to release this movie when half of the country is living paycheck to paycheck and 40 million are unemployed. I honestly don't see how anyone without a trust fund could enjoy this? O you burned your school down, told off multiple Ivy League schools and yet you still have enough money to buy a condo in a European beach city? Wow so relatable"
The F**k-It List,07-Jul-20,Characters do whatever they want and have zero consequences. They're pretty shallow with no backstory also. Reeks of privilege.
The F**k-It List,09-Jul-20,"The movie goes to show that if you are rich you can get away with anything.More importantly, characters evolve from bland to plain nonsensical. These characters take pride in their lack of self reflection. Imagine jean ralphio from parks and recreation.Do yourself a favour and just watch something else."
The F**k-It List,06-Jul-20,"Summary: a spoiled and entitled brat, with everything and everyone on his side, who has never encountered adversity of any kind on his life, suddenly decides to throw everything away because Harvard, Yale etc are not good enough for him.

The F**k-It List,13-Jul-20,"Great advice for rich kids of LA. Who needs to actually work for what you get? Just go viral one time, turn down scholarships, and instead jaunt around Europe with your crush."
The F**k-It List,14-Jul-20,"Entitled rick kids and their problems. . No one in this movie is likable. 10%ers have it so hard! Even the hot chick comes across as pathetic, unbelievable and unlikable. I just could not find the smallest spark of empathy for these rich, pampered (teens?). And of course we had to get the PC LBGQT (whatever) spot where the best friend admits he's gay, even though it had Zero to do with the plot or storyline. Wow . .this movie just sucked. After watching the excellent ""Nobody knows I'm here"" yesterday, this was just waste material. (as in TP)"
The F**k-It List,18-Jul-20,The scene with the prank gone wrong is pretty epic.BUT...If you want to see white privilege teen refuse Ivy League schools but still get millions of followers and STILL get accepted to Harvard - watch this unrelatable film.They likened the main character to Mark Zuckerberg - a very frustrating film.
The F**k-It List,11-Jul-20,"I wanted to like this movie, I did. The main character Just so hard to like... he is obnoxious and entitled like your typical gen z. He doesn't apologize or take responsibility for messing up, values social media fame over getting an education. Watch something else!"
The F**k-It List,09-Jul-20,The most self entitled set of characters I have ever seen. I am rooting for no one.
The F**k-It List,14-Jul-20,"Brilliant story about a guy, who found everything ready in life, got bored and blew everything just to have fun...
Let's just change the characters. Instead of rich white guy with wealthy parents, put a hardworking kid from the poor family.. Will he behave the same way? Easy to go wild when you drive fathers' Mercedes and live in the huge house with the pool. Screw it! Let's go crazy, not care about people, environment and other things, let's burn books, schools and other thing.
Millions of kids nowadays do not have even access to schools and sharing books as treasures. So I do not really understand the message of this movie, especially during this crisis we are going through now."
The F**k-It List,03-Jul-20,"This film promoting rebellion and stupidity for young Americans is a perfect example of why Trump is running the country into the ground and killing tens of thousands of Americans. Go ahead, take no personal responsibility, act out, die."
The F**k-It List,18-Jul-20,The main character is a unlikable entitled d bag who is constantly whining. The writing is horrible. The parents are idiots because parents are dumb. The love interest is a boring and stupid girl that wants to become a model who is prostituting herself out. Bottom line is Netflix needs to start producing some quality content or I'm dropping it.
The F**k-It List,03-Jul-20,"A 3 for the romance, a 2 for the comedy and a little bit more for the score. the actors are good at talking, but not stalking.its just one of those senior high movie-stuff, not as crazy and stupid as the main stream romcom, but it doesnt reach deep into your heart. its like booksmart, everything happens within 24 hours, and its like''the last nigt of the pranks''.it has a story of love and happiness, but it doesnt fondle above the knee of what the grumpy old man holds as a standard for these kind of movies. so if you like to learn some high school anarchistic pranks, then be my guest, for the rest its for the rainy sunday afternoon. a weak 6."
The F**k-It List,04-Jul-20,I had pretty low expectations but surprisingly it was fresh & had some genuine good moments. The coming of age or anti establishment wasn't too forceful or cathartic but it's ok. Lead actor was good. Overall breezy fun to watch if free on weekend.
The F**k-It List,14-Jul-20,"As I was watching this movie I thought to myself ""this really is a bad movie"", the acting and the direction isn't the greatest.The movie centres on a teenager from a privileged family, supposedly with a high IQ, applying to the best universities in the US. As the movie progresses I couldn't help but feel little to no empathy for his character.What a flop."
The F**k-It List,08-Jul-20,"The movie started with great pace and promise, but it slowed down towards the middle. It even felt like it was going in reverse at one point! Many of the characters were not thoroughly fleshed out, particularly the main character's parents. No way would they have been so rah-rah supportive, in such a short amount of time, of their son's newly found freedom."
The F**k-It List,02-Jul-20,"Considering the culture of the world in 2020 and how things are shaping, this movie feels like it would have been great had it been made 20 years ago. The problems the characters face are totally unrelatable to 99% of the population. It is as if the creators have been stuck in a time machine and still believe going to college and fulfilling our parents expectations are still relevant problems. They are, but they have been rehashed hundreds of times in the past.The only forgiving things this movie has going for it is it is midly entertaining. I also liked that the main character has dynamic morals and is willing to listen and learn."
The F**k-It List,07-Jul-20,"Crying about this being white privilege grow up you melts, also the film was ok."
The F**k-It List,11-Jul-20,"Just a stupid teenager who thinks it's cool to abandon a successful life that he'd been working on for 18 years, for a girl.

She's like, oh yeah im going to destroy my dads' car. like, ok i guess. then she's sad that she has nowhere to go, when the mc OFFERS TO LET HER STAY AT HIS HOUSE.

The F**k-It List,17-Jul-20,"I mean I usually am able to sit down and enjoy just about any movie I watch. This is one of the few I've ever felt so compelled to register to IMDB for just to let everyone know how much of a piece of trash this was.I don't really know how to write a movie review, but this kid and his friends blow up a portion of the school, there is some BS police investigation because of his 'movement' and then he turns down multiple opportunists from Harvard to go chase his love interest? I usually enjoy these low effort movies enough but this one was just absolute trash, don't waste your time."
The F**k-It List,16-Jul-20,"To make characters this unlikable. Not sure if the casting, the writing, the editing, the directing or a combination of them all made this movie so bad. The lead is supposed to have a high IQ? Not believable. This movie missed its mark on so many levels. It really could have been an inspirational, funny and entertaining movie however it just emphasizes how sh!tty entitled teens can be. Oh and the music? So annoying!"

After accidentally publishing a f**k-it list via social media, the list goes viral and boosts his presence into a cultural influencer.well... this movie is not the best out there, but it entails some key elements of our digital age. It is watchable if you like the typical ""coming-of-age"" flick.Other than that, there are no surprises, only cliches."
Relic,12-Jul-20,"The Babadook (2014) had an underlining meaning of a grieving single mother's struggle in raising a child in a ruthless society, all told through a horror genre. RELIC reveals the agony of dementia in a dark and twisted atmospheric visual and audio assault of the senses in a nightmarish tone.Kay visits her neglected mother, Edna, who has gone missing. Kay's daughter, Sam, tags along and they are greeted with an old large home, perfect for a haunting. Edna's home has a life of its own, as seen through effective dark visuals and eerie sounds that mother and daughter encounter. They also notice hints of Edna's forgetfulness with post-it note reminders around the home.A search begins for Edna, who eventually appears after a few days, just like coming out of a stint in the prison of dementia. Edna cannot recall her whereabouts, so mother and daughter quietly put it down to the beginning of Edna's mental disintegration.This sets the motion of conflict between mother and daughter with issues of caring and the dreaded decision making of nursing homes. Meanwhile, Edna's mental state deteriorates as she eats away at the memories of photos and buries a photo album in the forest. Just like her memories being buried by the black muck that is growing through her body.Edna's granddaughter is confronted by the horrors of the onset of her grandmother's dementia. Confused and frustrated she investigates the dark hole of the disease and finds herself trapped in a horrid maze within the nightmare realm of the home. In actual fact, Sam has fallen into the mind of her grandmother's dementia, experiencing the state of confusion and horror of the dreaded disease.Kay has been observing Edna's onset of dementia in a silent stupor. Eventually she is forced to act in order to not only save her daughter, but her mother from self-harming. Mother and daughter manage to fight through the confronting maze of dementia, only to see Edna succumb to it and become an unrecognisable empty shell, similar to a monster. Kay is unable to walk away from it and accepts the outcome of Edna's now full-blown dementia.Sam does not recognise her grandmother anymore, as is the effect of the disease. But what Sam discovers is the dark murky stain that was growing on her grandmother's body has now appeared on her mother, stating that this disease is hereditary, which is the real horror to this tale!RELIC is a journey through the mindset of dementia, not only for the victim but for the loved ones coming to terms with it. All this delivered in a highly intelligent and subliminal work of perfect filmmaking."
Relic,10-Jul-20,"I've been awaiting the arrival of this film ever since watching the trailer a few weeks ago. It had that depth of darkness and a feeling of realness to it that I look for in a good horror film. Relic explores the subject of dementia in a unique fashion that will pull at your heart strings. Especially for those that have dealt with the illness first hand.Relic is essentially a drama which disguises itself as a horror film by using a few of the classic horror conventions and clichés. The metaphors provide the real horror here.The three main actors do a great job of conveying the story and deliver a wonderful performance that will leave you emotionally gripped throughout. Where Relic lacks, is in pace. At times it can be rather dull, long winded and only finally picks up in the last 1/3rd of the film.The climax of the film will have you on the edge of your seat and is easily the best part of the film. Those that don't like thought provoking, symbolic conclusions will probably want to stay clear of this one. Still, it's one of the more memorable endings to a film I've seen in a while and undoubtedly uncomfortable.This one is worth the runtime just for the brilliant score, ambiance and composition. You definitely need a decent pair of headphones or a nice sound system to get the most out of this one. The film is very dark, visually, it can be hard to make out specific details in most scenes. Obviously this is done to expand the creepy and unpredictable atmosphere but if anything, makes the film seem duller.It's not a 10/10 movie by any means but it does serve as a mildly entertaining way to pass an hour and a half of time. Especially if you don't have anything else to do or watch. Give it a go, you may like it.My retrospective on this one: sometimes you have to discard the old version of a person you knew and learn to love them for what they've become."
Relic,10-Jul-20,"The 4 out of 10 stars is generous. The acting was great, that's it. Let me save you some trouble here. The whole movie is a metaphor for Alzheimers. I give one star because I can connect in that I had a grandmother with Alzheimer's, and it was an accurate protrayl, but my grandmother was far less boring. All the questions they ask have very vague answers, and I don't think many people could guess the answers to them. I could list 3 somewhat spooky things that happen, but why they happened? I don't know, either black mold or Alzheimer's, maybe both. This movie isn't scary, it isn't clever, and it draaaagged. An hour and a half long movie. 5 minutes of blank staring and 3 minutes of dream sequences that have little point. This movie makes me want to have Alzheimer's so I can forget I watched it."
Relic,16-Jul-20,"Another one of these films where most reviews here say a lot more about the reviewer than the film.This is quite an intelligent debut. Not a masterpiece, but obviously not ""the worst movie ever"" or ""incredibly boring""It's just a bit more original than the average Blumhouse blueprinted copycat."
Relic,11-Jul-20,"It's so rare that anyone uses the horror genre to tell you something you needed to know about life. I'm absolutely overwhelmed at how elegantly this film horrified me, how totally it drew me in, and the *work* being done by the cast.A really beautiful, touching, absolutely terrifying movie, that hit me across nearly every note. My gosh. Worth a watch."
Relic,10-Jul-20,"Honestly couldn't see half of what was going on. Greatly overrated, which is sad because I love a good Australian movie."
Relic,14-Jul-20,"I'm literally going through this with a family member and it really made me think. Is this what she goes through everyday? It's scary. More of a thriller than a horror movie, but I liked it. For all the people giving it a crappy rating, for not ""explaining"", it was explained, it was just over your head. They stepped into what she was seeing. Every rotted piece, was another memory forgotten. The walls closing in, in her mind. The way she saw her home, now. Symbolism, people, symbolism. I wouldn't say, ""it was a 10/10"", but it did shine a light on the ugliness that waits for some of us."
Relic,10-Jul-20,"Here we go again....Another attempt of a slow burn horror but the only thing that burnt out was my patience. I mean it's one thing if after all the build up made suspense we would actually get some genuine scares but here it is just not there. Nothing, Nada, not a single moment of fear.At the end of the day the movie can look good, have fine actors and possess a decent story but it would be nothing without the actually horror which turns out to be the title of the genre.Avoid."
Relic,09-Jul-20,"Greetings again from the darkness. Anyone who has a friend or relative afflicted with dementia knows it's often like living in a real life horror film. It's frustrating and claustrophobic and guilt-inducing and above all, frightening. The first feature film from director Natalie Erika James deals with dementia, amongst other topics, in the guise of a horror film. Is it a haunted house movie? Is it a demonic presence movie? Well, yes to both. The script from Ms. James and Christian White blends multiple familiar aspects of horror films into something that ends up quite original.""Ends up"" is the key, because the first two-thirds of the story moves slower than a glacier in the middle of winter. Don't get me wrong, the film looks great - the house and the atmosphere are ultra-creepy. It's just that almost nothing happens during that span, and that's an eternity for set up. Kay (Emily Mortimer) receives a call that a neighbor hasn't seen her mother in a while. Kay and her 20ish daughter Sam (Bella Heathcote, PRIDE AND PREJUDICE AND ZOMBIES, 2016) take the drive over the hills and through the woods to grandmother's house. Their initial measured walk-thru of the house tells them (and us) much. Post-it notes are stuck everywhere, including one that says ""Don't follow it"". Spoiled fruit on the counter, a favorite chair moved, and food for a pet long ago passed, are all indicators that something is off. If that's not enough, the house that grandma is missing from has mold on the walls and ceiling, and strange locks on doors.After an unsuccessful search party through the nearby woods, Grandma Edna (Robyn Nevin) reappears with no recollection of where she's been. Of course, this doesn't really improve things for anyone. We sense that workaholic Kay and her mother have never really been close, and the same can be said for Kay and Sam. Generational disconnect is on display. And poor Edna has lost her husband, her pet dog, and most of her essence ... except for the few moments when she snaps back to lucidity.Dread and impending doom dominate every scene for the first hour. Kay has dreams of an old cabin from her past, and Edna has an unexplained bruise on her chest. The stained glass window on the front door is a key, and the sounds coming from the walls are unable to be tracked down. As disoriented as Edna is, the house itself has that impact on us and Sam. Is it the house that's haunted, or the characters?The cinematography from Charlie Sarroff plays well off the stillness and unknown, and the sound design and music (Brian Reitzell) work hand-in-hand in establishing the creepy atmosphere. The three actresses are superb, and I especially enjoyed Ms. Nevin and her piercing eyes, as she is known mostly for her live theatre work (and also as Councillor Dillard in The Matrix movies). For her first feature, Ms. James has delivered a high-concept Australian horror/suspense film with a very original (and weird) ending. Others may be a bit higher on the film, but we likely all agree that Ms. James is an intriguing filmmaker."
Relic,16-Jul-20,"The movie is good in the sense that it makes you feel how does it to have a family member who has dementia illness, alzheimer.The movie depicts the feelings of being lost, and helplessness in the face of an illness that can turn a person into something else, to a different person. And it also teaches you to deal with it, you need to embrace it.Good visual scenes, and sound effects. Normally, I don't like movies like this but I liked this one."
Relic,12-Jul-20,"Apparently this one is not for everyone but I found it terrifying. This descent into dementia is both troubling and shocking. It portrays the overtaking of this disorienting madness creeping on the victim leaving them into a state of decrepitude and their powerless loved ones left to watch. It's a different kind of horror, one that suggests how a disease slowly seeps and infects everything until the inevitable end. Everything familiar gets corrupted by an overpowering darkness that parasites the afflicted until they're unrecognizable, a shadow of their former selves. It rots all identifiable elements of who they were until all is left is a bare core. A vessel submerged by a lifetime accumulation of stuff, a demented mess hunted by the only thing that remains, the sum of all its fears. It's scary because it's inevitable and the poisoned gift transcends time like a curse raking havoc and destruction throughout generations."
Relic,11-Jul-20,A young director clearly inspired by the great Aronofsky writes and directs a masterpiece about death and loss using craftily symbolisms.The movie is not for everybody to comprehend and clearly has an average of 6/10 cause most people expecting to see a cliche haunted house story.
Relic,10-Jul-20,"To start off, I've read a lot of good reviews about this movie, so I was hopeful that it would be a promising first movie by a new director, but it's just......eh. Twenty minutes in and I wanted to watch the movie sped up, it felt slow and nothing was really happening, I think that it was trying to go for a slow build-up but it just didn't work for me. I didn't care about the characters, I knew little to nothing about the ""ghost"" or whatever the whole black ash stuff was, and there was really nothing new or unique about this movie, sorry that this seems harsh but I felt like I watched a live-action version of a run-of-the-mill indie horror game. The dream sequences felt like they meant nothing and they were just repeats of the same thing, a cabin in the woods, a glass window, and the grandmother. I'm just disappointed and confused about how this movie I wasted money on got so much praise.It would've been fine as a short, indie, horror game, whispering voices, a few jump scares, and a few ""TURN BACK"" notes, and then an ending with a jumpscare. I get that it's supposed to also be a metaphor for Alzheimer's but I didn't really get to know the grandmothers past enough to feel bad for her memory loss, no flashbacks, pictures, or videos. I completely think that this movie would've been better off being a drama about a woman and her daughter dealing with the grandmother's Alzheimers instead of this weird supernatural mess. A good example of a movie that was able to perfectly do family drama and horror is ""Hereditary"", there were enough arguments and somber moments to keep your attention as a family drama and there were enough creepy moments to keep you interested in how the horror was going to play out. However, hereditary is a movie that took a lot of detail, money, and had a lot more behind it than this movie probably had, no offense of course.But the director didn't use what they had to their best ability. On a positive note, I did think that there was one good emotional moment that displayed Alzheimer's, and I kind of liked the last scene in the movie even if I didn't understand what the hell it meant. But in the end, skip this one, keep your money, or watch a better movie instead."
Relic,10-Jul-20,"I give this film 8/10 for the atmosphere and the fact that although not a classic horror/no jump scares the atmosphere is so creepy and the ending so unsettling it makes for a great watching experience.
I still have a few unanswered questions but so far this is the best I've seen this year"
Relic,10-Jul-20,"Why do these awful artsy fartsy contrived dramas keep being passed as horror when they're absolutely not. Are critics just that clueless and deluded? This plays by the numbers like so many other critically hailed ""horror"" films of the last decade. Apparently to get great reviews you can just follow the same dry uninspired formula of symmetrical camerawork and supposed dread inducing overacting. Then add a deep metaphorical message that is just as effective as an actual visual monster because "" what you can't see is scarier"". No that isn't true horror. It's drama. It's just such a miserably lazy film even though Mortimer salvages it from being truly terrible."
Relic,12-Jul-20,"Any negative reviews come from people who do not have a real appreciation for cinema. This movie was unique and thought-provoking. I wanted to start it again as soon as it ended. If you liked The Babadook, this is for you."
Relic,11-Jul-20,"...and yet so boring and totally pointless!Classed as an horror but there is nothing horrific apart from a woman suffering from alzheimer's and yet gives absolutely no insight in to that condition (last 10 minutes excluded when the film decides ohhh lets try to be an horror and yet still fails miserably - I get this is supposed to be an analogy of the former person but it doesn't work)Badly lit throughout, terrible dialogue, some off the cuff examples of losing your memory, obscure weird scenes that never connect up or seem to even have any relevance and never touched on again...the list goes onIf you want to see a film about alzheimer's then watch Still Alice - a real horror film without all the pretentiousness of this one"
Relic,10-Jul-20,Disappointed in the plot despite a great cast. No real riveting storyline and a waste of time. Generally love a good Australian thriller but this did not live up to expectations
Relic,23-Jul-20,"This is well done and I can't say I have seen anything like it. The actors are very good and the script is creative and well timed. It's a fairly slow burn but not enough to lose your attention. I love a good horror but this one hit too close to home. I couldn't handle it. That's never happened before.
When I was a teenager, my best friend and I, used to get rocked and go see movies like The Exorcist. So, when I say I couldn't handle THIS movie, that says something.
If you love a good horror and you are the target audience, this one will give you nightmares. If you're not the target audience, it probably won't phase you. For instance, if you are afraid of flying, then movies about aircraft accidents will effect you. If you are not afraid of flying you can mentally step back and not get nervous watching a movie about airplane accidents. It's like that. If something like this has even remotely touched your life, this movie will rattle your cage big time."
Relic,10-Jul-20,"The story in this movie is allegory to mental disease such as dementia or Alzheimer's. Dealing with a family member that ""transforms"" from a person you knew your whole life into ""a creature"" that doesn't remember its own name IS a horror in real life. So although idea of this movie is not bad, the execution could be better. I agree with others: it is too slow and dull. And, no, it is not really a horror flick, i am sure many horror fans will agree.
I still recommend it for home viewing.
Another spoiler: the fact that they show three generations of women in the same family kind of suggest that disease is hereditary (like Alzheimer's), that is why in the end the daughter has a black spot too, meaning it will happen to her like it did to her parents."
Relic,10-Jul-20,"A solid debut for Natalie James. This is a slow burn horror that builds with each minute, and by the third act is full blown terror. All of the acting was surprisingly phenomenal, extremely impressed by Bella Heathcote. The third act is a fun ride, claustrophobic and even a little gore. Give it a shot, you wont be disappointed."
Relic,15-Jul-20,"Hey Natalie Erika James (director), learn how to LIGHT your scenes. I gave up bothering trying to see what you were trying to show when something supposedly creepy was happening.What was truly insufferable was your actors WALKING AT A SNAILS PACE in every scene. Its been done to death, does not create any tension and you just abused it to stretch out the films running time. Not impressed. Sick to death of lame characters walking in slow mo. Hurry the F up and get on with it.A 50 year old and 20 something year old are over powered by an 80 year old, and then run terrified from her. Seriously? LOL. I was itching for the old bag to die, I really was. I could not stomach her.Constant ""mum...mum...mum....mum....mum?"" dialogue then playing cat and mouse. It truly gets BORING watching the daughter and grand daughter walk in slow mo after the old bag over and over and over.This movie is a 'The Babadook wannabe (which wasn't that great either), using pretentious metaphors for depression and Alzheimers. Yawn. Also, the tilting camera shot of the hallway has been done to death and SUCKS.The dream sequences were nonsensical and the grannys dementia materialized as an entity/whatever in the house was never fully utilized in my humble opinion.The ending? Shes a shell of her former self I take it and her sanity dead in the water. Everything that was her has gone, leaving a corpse. Again, made no sense.Also, couldn't stand Bella Heathcote (Sam). Typical millennial bore with zero charisma. Emily Mortimer (Kay) phones in her performance.An utter dog turd from start to finish. Have a nice day. Please don't make any more movies, thanks."
Relic,10-Jul-20,Just a whole film of nothingness....the annoyance of every shot in complete darkness makes it unwatchable...
Relic,12-Jul-20,"Do you know the word ""Boring"" is the worst thing you can say for any artwork ? Better say its not interesting or has no substance or not inspirational.One hour and 5 minutes into the movie and absolutely nothing has happened. I should have gone for take out food eat it have a bath and let the movie play.Im saving you 1 hour of your life. 3 women wondering doing nothing inside a house for an hour. I can do that myself. Why do I have to watch it in a movie ??Movies are made to entertain you keep you company have a good time and something to talk about. Nobody has ever talked about anything that is boring in the entire history of the world.Movie has faded colours, shot in darkness, no soundtrack, nothing happens. I have more fun relieving myself in the toilet than watching this movie.If this was a stage play in a theater there would be more people drinking soda in the lobby than people inside the theater. Probably I would throw empty cans of soda at the actors for doing nothing because I paid for a play and nothing happens.Excuse me people Im retiring to the toilet where I have more fun there. Or anywhere for that matter."
Relic,11-Jul-20,"Making movies for today's horror audience is a tricky proposition, but Relic impressed me with it's commitment to telling an emotional story that resonates with issues which you may recognise from our lives outside of the ""fantasy-horror"" tropes. The movie is a slow burn which devotes the majority of its time to establishing the central 3 characters (impressive performances), who make up 3 generations of women from an old family in an old house in rural Victoria. If you enjoy thoughtful film-making with a ""less is more"" approach, you'll be rewarded by a masterfully disturbing and shocking third act climax with an emotional kick that will give you closure but leave you thinking. It should be noted though, just the like characters in Relic, you'll have to give attention to the people in front of you to reap the rewards."
Midway,10-Nov-19,"If you want to bypass the quibbles and get straight to the meat of this review, please skip to my last paragraph.The Battle of Midway is a story that's well known to most Annapolis graduates of my generation and earlier. The battle was a key inflection point in World War II, perhaps the pivotal moment changing the course of the Pacific War.Although I loved seeing Henry Fonda as Nimitz in the 1976 version of ""Midway"" (Fonda was to play Nimitz in ""In Harms Way"" as well), unfortunately, I found that movie to be surprisingly dull, historically inaccurate, unnecessarily melodramatic, and generally not very good.Because my experience is that more recent movie renderings of historical subjects usually don't improve the historical accuracy (I'm thinking of 2001's God-awful Ben Affleck ""Pearl Harbor"" vis-à-vis 1970's ""Tora Tora Tora""), I did not have high hopes for this new ""Midway.""I was wrong.In short, ""Midway"" is a terrific movie. Not only does it get the history (mostly) right, it's a tight, elegant, and superb rendering that does the historical figures proud. It succeeds to pack way more into its 2 hour, 18 minute run length than you can imagine. It covers the attack on Pearl Harbor, the PACFLT-Washington tension & dynamic, Nimitz's ascension to command of the Pacific, LCDR Layton's contribution to the intelligence picture, Joe Rochefort's robe-wearing genius, Yamamoto's soul-searching, Halsey's tenacity, the ascendency of naval aviation, a tiny bit of the submarine contributions to the battle, and-oh yeah-the actual battle itself, to include the incredible, unbelievable jaw-dropping (but true!) heroism of our Yorktown and Enterprise naval aviators. And it does all this justice, in a superb bit of moviemaking.Can a 26-year Navy veteran like me find nits to pick on? Of course:
I saw a few collar devices that weren't pinned on right (I'm talking about you, Layton!)At least one scene that is historical legend but didn't really happenThe substantially underrepresented submarine role in the battle (being a submariner, perhaps my biggest regret)Some Annapolis grads wearing their class ring on the wrong hand (tradition has us wearing our rings on our left hand, not the right)Sailors not ""squaring away"" their Dixie cup hats the way they would have back thenI wish the Pearl Harbor officers' club was as nice as they portrayed it in the movie!They placed a non-existent cemetery on Pearl Harbor's Hospital PointKimmel didn't watch the attack from the Pacific Fleet headquarters, he watched it from his office on the Pearl Harbor submarine base (which later became my office and is on the national register of historic places)They would not have worn their service dress khaki in the Officer's Club-- they would have worn service dress whites (chokers)The band in the O-club would have been locals not sailors (they missed an opportunity to have somebody like Gabby Pahinui playing!)But the good stuff way exceeds the nits:
They got the Pacific Fleet headquarters right-- it's not the Pearl Harbor shipyard commander's buildingThey got the torpedo failures right-- torpedoes were terrible early in the warThey got the Yorktown repair in 48 hours in Drydock 4 in the Pearl Harbor shipyard right-- the shipyard rendering was near perfectThey got the code breaking room in the basement of the PACFLT headquarters right (when I was stationed there the room was being used to store furniture and I petitioned to get it on the national register of historic places)It might have been a lot of CGI, but it was really good CGI. They rendered Pearl Harbor almost perfectly. I could even make out my Ford Island house from my time as commodore, as well as a historically accurate rendering of Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard, the Pearl Harbor submarine base, and of course, the ships and planes.Something I never thought I'd hear myself say: Woody Harrelson was superb as Nimitz. He's no Fonda, but he was understated and believable, the way I've always seen Nimitz in my mind. Not a casting idea I would have thought of, but it worked!Except for the collar device issue listed above, the uniforms were exactly right for the period, from the flat shoulder boards that were being used in that era, to the beaten-up look the ship's laundry would have given Service Dress Khaki, to the way the sailors were dressed, to the way the pilots wore their wings, etc.It even brought out the fact that movie director John Ford was on Midway doing a documentary when the battle went down. The fact that Ford volunteered for the Navy, saw battle, and was injured, while John Wayne remained (in his mind) safely at home, become a point of tension between the two men, with Ford being one of the few who felt comfortable belittling Wayne for his lack of service as the years went by.I really liked the outtro mini-bios of the real characters at the end. I didn't learn anything new there, but thought they were extremely well done.In the end the 2+ hours flew by for me. It was so good, I plan on seeing it again next weekend. What a terrific way to celebrate Veteran's Day.Of course, Roland Emmerich's prior movies have been, on the whole, simpleminded blockbusters. But this time he took a risk by doing something thoughtful, respectful, accurate, and artistic. The only way to ensure movies like this continue to be made is for the public to show we care about history and accuracy, and to make this movie a success. I very much hope it does well. Then maybe we have a chance of getting the right movie made about the Indianapolis.A final thought: I've been disgusted by many of the cynical, snarky reviews written by professional movie reviewers, many of which sneer at the bravery of the warriors depicted. Yes, the dialog in this movie is sometimes simple, tired, and trite. A few of the characters are not well developed, particularly the women. It's perfectly appropriate for reviewers to criticize elements of moviemaking. One reviewer made fun of the line of dialog where Best says ""This is for Pearl Harbor."" There is nothing silly or unreasonable about that line. You can bet one of the pilots actually said something like that that day. As somebody who survived 9/11 attack on the Pentagon, when I later went to Afghanistan, you can bet if I had the chance to do so I would have said, ""This is for Gerry DeConto,"" one of my friends who didn't make it out that day. But many these sneering reviewers have gone on to say to readers that because of these weaknesses, they should not see ""Midway."" Keep in mind that there were similar elements of Spielberg's ""Lincoln"" that could be considered inaccurate and/or over-the-top movie-making (most of the scenes depicted in Congress, for example), but on the whole the events portrayed in that movie are important for Americans to understand. Same is true here. So the point I want to make is this: a movie can have elements of poor moviemaking, and yet be an important movie for viewers to watch. ""Midway"" is one such movie. It depicts a poorly understood event in American history, but one that Americans should be exposed to. The events depicted, and the people depicted, are real. They really did these things. The bravery was real. Americans need to know this, and reviewers who have likely never risked anything in their lives should have the good graces not to sneer at those who have."
Midway,29-Oct-19,"This film is a straightforward retelling of the events in the first months of the War in the Pacific beginning with Pearl Harbor and culminating in the Battle of Midway (June 1942). In between, it also touched on Doolittle's Raid on Tokyo (April 1942) and the Battle of Coral Sea (May 1942). The story was told mainly from the point of view of two American soldiers, namely pilot Lt. Dick Best (Ed Skrein) who led his dive bomber squadron at Midway, and intelligence officer Lt. Comm. Edwin Layton (Patrick Wilson) who with his code-breaker team predicted the Midway attack.Along the way, we meet other famous American soldiers: Admiral Chester Nimitz (Woody Harrelson) Commander in Chief of the US Pacific Fleet; Vice Admiral William ""Bull"" Halsey (Dennis Quaid) who led the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise; Rear Admiral Raymond Spruance (Jake Weber) who took over the Enterprise for the Battle of Midway; Best's fellow aviators Lt. Comm. Wade McClusky (Luke Evans), Lt. Comm. Eugene Lindsey (Darren Criss) and Lt. Comm. Jimmy Doolittle (Aaron Eckhart); cryptographer Commander Joseph Rochefort (Brennan Brown) and Aviation Machinist Mate Bruno Gaido (Nick Jonas).The side of the Japanese Imperial Army and their unique military culture were also given fair screen time in this film. Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto (Etsushi Toyokawa) of the Imperial Japanese Navy and the Commander in Chief of their combined fleet, was portrayed with calm and quiet dignity. We also get to meet other Japanese officers and their own brands of leadership Rear Admiral Tamon Yamaguchi (Tadanobu Asano) who commanded the Hiryu with nobility, and Vice Admiral Chuichi Nagumo (Jun Kunimura) whose controversial battle decisions had negative impact against the Japanese campaign.The execution of the critical battle scenes are the main draws to watch this film. Director Roland Emmerich will always be remembered as the man who brought us ""Independence Day"" (1996) and ""2012"" (2009). Of course, there are big explosions and massive destruction here as well. The massive scenes showing fiery exploding seacraft and aircraft were rendered with crisp cinematography and meticulous visual effects to create impressive screen spectacles. The aviation scenes, particularly the dive bomber runs by Dick Best, were excellently staged, shot and edited to elicit an exhilarating rush.For its 2 hours 18 minute run, the story of the crucial naval battles and the heroism of its real-life protagonists were front and center here in ""Midway."" There were no fictional characters or cheesy love stories like in the first ""Midway"" film or ""Pearl Harbor."" While seeing some popular young actors like Criss or Jonas can be distracting, the all-star cast generally rendered honor and respect to the heroes they portrayed. Focusing on soldiers of lesser rank allowed for some intimate personal drama in actual battle situations, perhaps with not much depth as possible. As this movie is rated PG, so do not expect to see graphic injuries at the level of ""Saving Private Ryan."""
Midway,10-Nov-19,"This is probably the first time in over 50 years Hollywood made a solid war movie without inserting a sappy, contrived romantic sub-plot, pushing some radical political agenda, or re-writing history.
The movie is good. The dialogue is believable, natural, and convincingly delivered in almost all cases.While no movie is perfectly accurate historically - historians don't even agree on much, so who is to say - the few errors here are trivial and immaterial to the how events progressed. As somebody who is a buff on this period of the early Pacific war - reading every book by Prange, Lord, and many others - I was very impressed.I went into this movie expecting the worst from Hollywood, but this was their best historical piece in generations. Even the casting seemed to echo the real people in looks and demeanor.The Japanese point of view wasn't neglected either. While I can't say whether the Japanese dialogue was believable or well-delivered, by all outward appearances this acting was also top notch. The similarity between the real Admiral Nagumo and the actor was particularly striking. They made the right call in using solid Japanese actors speaking Japanese.The accurate portrayal of the friction between the Imperial Navy and Imperial Army with Emperor Hirohito almost powerless to restrain the militarists was very refreshing. This was a very important, complex contributing factor to the war. Few outside Japan and some narrow historical circles ever learn about this dynamic.About the worst I can say about this movie is the pace was too fast. Unless stretched into an 8 hour mini-series, I can't imagine they could have avoided this. With my background, I could fill in gaps and context the movie seemed to miss. Others might be left confused. Even though not well-read on this chapter of history, my spouse followed the storyline without issue and really enjoyed the movie as entertainment.Kudos to the producers, writers, actors, and entire crew. This was a job well-done and a fitting tribute to heroes like Layton and Best."
Midway,18-Nov-19,"First, I'll agree that the filmmakers got a lot of details right: The timing of the U.S. attacks when the Japanese were caught in the rearming process. The poor performance of the Devastator TBD. Faulty torpedoes. The politics of the Japanese military. The fast turn-around getting Yorktown out to sea again. And lots more.But the errors, embellishments and omissions were glaring: The Marshal Islands attack was ridiculously inflated. The Kamikaze hit on Enterprise during that battle (complete with Nick Jonas saving the day) never took place. The complete absence of American fighter planes on the American carriers. American attackers going in and facing anti aircraft fire without having first been jumped by Zeroes, and the missing dogfights via F4F fighter escorts. SBDs blowing Zeros out of the sky. Taking the time to depict John Ford as a brave movie maker on Midway, yet not showing Marine Fighter Squadron 221, flying antiquated equipment, going out to meet the incoming Japanese attackers against overwhelming odds and pretty much getting slaughtered. Yorktown's involvement in the battle reduced to one scene where she is burning, depicted from afar. The Nautilus getting depth-charged U-571 style. The ships in both fleets in such tight formations, it's more like a photo op than a battle formation.So many worthwhile details that could have been made right in the same screening length, if they would have simply ditched the goofy Doolittle sequence. I love Aaron Eckhart, great actor, but his scenes in China had no place in a movie called ""Midway,"" if the price was cutting out major elements of the Midway battle.Maybe I'm being picky, but when they go out of their way to glorify John Ford, while leaving out a squadron of Marine fighter pilots that sacrificed themselves so valiantly, it just strikes me as typical Hollywood b.s."
Midway,27-Nov-19,"Abundant, not-quite-realistic computer-generated images make Midway look more like a video game than a depiction of real-life events. The overuse of subpar effects is the most dominant - but hardly the only - problem dogging this film. Epic war stories are difficult to tell without focusing on a few characters. This film unsuccessfully juggles too many plot threads and too many characters to keep an emotional anchor to the simulated events unfolding. Woody Harrelson is outstanding, but other cast members cannot overcome the limitations of the material and the challenges of acting on computer-generated sets."
Midway,09-Nov-19,I am a veteran and this was a hit. The special effects were good and I don't understand why people were saying it was too much. The characters were evenly played out in the movie and there was no stupid romance part that was in the last Pearl Harbor movie. It told the story amazingly and it dived right into what it's all about. You don't need too much character development to tell a story of four people during that time. It was such a great watch and I Definatley recommend it. It ranks up there as we were soldiers! It's been a long time a good war movie came out and this was it. And when you see other reviews about it's a disgrace to veterans don't listen to those reviews. Obviously they haven't been through tough times such as how these people lived. I was in live fire so I can compare. Enjoy the movie is amazing!
Midway,09-Nov-19,"This is an excellent historical portrayal of the Battle of Midway, and some of the events that led up to it. There is a lot of intensity throughout the film, and it shows how some of the decisions on both sides were truly a gamble in that time. There were no satellites, gps systems, or sophisticated radar systems. The only missing pieces to this movie, as noted by others, is the lack of US fighter planes. Maybe it is intended to focus mainly on the Dauntless pilots.
I took my wife and kids to see this movie, as it seems much of the history of this country is being forgotten. I am so glad I did. The kids had no idea that any of this happened.
As for the critics that wrote negative reviews and trashed this movie, I think attributes to a lot of what is wrong with this country today. People who decided not to see this movie, on Veterans Day weekend, based on the critics reviews, are truly missing an excellent movie.
This movie is historically accurate, with no lame love story, or fictional substories."
Midway,09-Nov-19,"Critics are trashing this film, I went into it skeptical. After, I'm not so sure why. They tell a simplified story of the events leading up to, and eventually the battle of midway. You get to see two sides of life, the Japanese and the American forces. The script is fine, acting is pretty good in my opinion as well (shout out to Dennis Quaid, he is a great salty kinda guy). CGI was not that bad, especially for fast paced scenes. Only complaint is it is a bit long, which I understand due to how much they wanted to include. But there were 2-3 times I thought it might end, but there were still a few minutes left. In the end, a solid war movie that, in my opinion, does a great job showing some brutality of war, in addition to brothership and slice of life of the time. A solid film to honor the brave men and women that died for a better future."
Midway,10-Nov-19,"As someone very knowledgeable about the subject, I was somewhat disappointed. Whether it was the wrinkled uniforms, the painful dialogue, the over-the-top dramatics and exaggerated explosions (hey, it's Emmerich!)... it was clear the film was not made for people like me who know the details and the characters very well.The rating depends greatly on the target audience. It's clear this film was made for a younger audience, and as such, it does a very good job of conveying the history quite accurately. It's a lot to take on with a 2:20 movie (complete with a 6-month summary of events leading up to the title battle) and it does a fine job of that.Correct history of this great nation tragically just isn't taught anymore, so I heartily applaud any effort to do so. I just wonder if younger audiences have any desire to learn it. So if I'm rating from that perspective, it jumps up a few points.I just wish a little more care with the details and script had been taken to leave the older audience satisfied from our knowledge level."
Midway,12-Nov-19,"I've read several of the critical reviews of ""Midway""; they seem to reveal more about the cattiness of the reviewer than any understanding of the movie, or its message.
I am part of the growing legion of American moviegoers who have pretty much given up on Hollywierd having any clue how to convince me to actually care enough about any of their offerings to part with the price of admission. I can wait a few months till they show up free on Youtube to confirm my suspicions that I haven't wasted my money.
I made the rare exception this weekend to see ""Midway"", because I'm a history buff, and the previews I'd seen showed promise that the story would be properly told. That said, I went in with the full expectation that it might fail my already low expectations.
Happy to say that it far exceeded my best hopes. Roland Emmerich has put together a gripping storyline that manages to get in all the important elements of an epic story in 128 minutes. For the story of the American victory at Midway is an epic tale that every American should become familiar with.
Few Americans today can fathom what dire straits the US found itself in in 1942: Our battleships lay in twisted ruins on the bottom of Pearl Harbor; we had four aircraft carriers facing a Japanese navy with twelve, equipped with aircraft which were far superior to anything that was then available to American fliers; those aircraft were piloted by experienced men who had honed their craft in four years of war in China. We helplessly watched as thousands of American soldiers, sailors and Marines in the Pacific Islands and the Philippines were made captive, beyond the reach of our aid.
All the Japanese had to do was to concentrate on Midway, overwhelm our inferior naval and air forces, and Hawaii and the West Coast would be wholly at their mercy.
The essayist Matthew Arnold once said, ""Have something to say, and say it as clearly as you can. That is all anyone needs to know about style."" Emmerich follows his advice. No actors involved in ""Midway"" will be nominated for an Oscar. Which is another way of saying that there are no star turns which detract from telling the story. I will say that the actors are very believable in their roles; as the son of a Marine who fought in the Pacific, I found their portrayals pretty convincing.
I'm firmly of the opinion that CGI effects are overused to distract from thin or non-existent plotlines. I credit Emmerich for using them to reinforce an already strong narrative. To those critics who found them overpowering, I inquire: How in hell do you think the shock of modern warfare registered on the men who actually faced it at Pearl Harbor and Midway? They called it ""shell shock"" for a damned good reason."
Midway,04-Jan-20,"All i can say is this : it's typical when an american history story is put into a movie it gets descent scores. This movie is not bad, but the quality of the CGI for a 2019 movie is just not good enough."
Midway,10-Nov-19,"Agree with other reviewer, this is the best war movie in a long time, it went through three historical events, attack on pearl harbor, doolittle Tokyo air raid and battle of midway linked together with a human story of a dive bomber pilot, and what a great history/story telling it was.
The beginning of the massive Enterprise aircraft carrier, shaking the theater with the Dolby sound has the feel of Star War IV Battle cruiser opening scene, and a tight story line and pace ensues. The CGI is the best, you don't see AT-6 Texan painted as Zero fighters, you don't see modern warships disguised as battle-hardened WW2 ones,from this point forward I predict we will see more movies with period-correct war machines. The movie has moments that make you sigh (dud torpedo that hit but didn't explode, bombs missed after pilot braved through clouds of flaks) and cheer (bulls-eyed on the giant Sun on the deck, and chain explosion of the littered ammos because of tactic confusions), this is Hollywood at its best in rare moments, no over lingering love story, no cliche stereotyped GIs, what you have are characters in a war trying to survive, trying to outsmart the other side, and trying but dying ... you can read about those three events before or after the movie, but for me, I enjoyed a great movie, finished till the credit ends and walked out feeling great, grateful and blessed as an American."
Midway,13-Nov-19,"Rating 4.0/10
I had high hopes for ""midway"" war between America and Japan, unfortunetly this movie goes to war of the bored. With the epic status that this movie was advertised with, it was a supreme disappointment. You will willingly sit through this movie but when it's over you'll feel like you wasted two hours. The action and special effect was okay. But the movie is somewhat claustrophobic. The acting was okay even if at times the script seemed daunted. In the end, If i had to describe midway in one word it would be disappointing."
Midway,08-Nov-19,"Midway is well made thrown back to the historical war movie epics of the 1960s and 1970s, covering a wide spectrum of elements that made up a key moment in history. It's not a perfect film, but its one of the best of its type to be made in a good long while.What MIDWAY provides us with is an ensemble piece narrative story covering events leading up to the turning point in The War In The Pacific, which was the battle of Midway. To invest us in the characters we're shown a snapshot journey of each of their lives from just before the attack on Pearl Harbour in December 1941 up until June of 1942 where the Japanese and American naval forces would try and surprise each other in what would be the battle of the films title. It's no easy feat to present us with a vast range of uniformed characters in the military, and get the viewer invested in them emotionally but the actors here to do well to make each of their characters stand out so when the film reaches its key climax we understand who is who and what their role is in the conflict. While some of the dialogue is obvious and overstated it serves the job with character dialogue scenes acting as segways from one historical stepping stone to the next as we follow the events that led up to the battle.Before I delve into the main negative, I will say overall this is a great movie which could be really enhanced by an extended edition or extra running time if if there's more scenes that were cut out covering the battle of Midway itself - and if so PLEASE PUT THEM BACK IN A LONGER CUT - PEOPLE WILL BUY IT ON BLU-RAY! This is where the main problem with this film lies. Over half of its running time is dedicated to the raid on Pearl Harbour, The Doolittle Raid and the battles leading up to and including The Coral Sea, the latter of which is told pretty much in one scene and a single VFX shot (Good though it was) - Not an issue per say, as this film is not called 'The Battle of The Coral Sea' - and while some of these scenes give much context and required emotional threads for both characters and the younger audience members alike, others really didn't need to be seen in this film. It felt as if the events surrounding the Chinese assisting the Doolittle Raid survivors was probably a condition of some VFX funding tax break for the Asian based post-production budget. An allied radio report of the raid itself, perhaps being heard by the pilots of the American carriers was really all that was needed. Whatever the reason, these scenes add little to the key story or characters involved in the subsequent battle and even though they sign post the path that led to Midway, it's not something that couldn't have been covered in a single title card at the beginning of the film. The battle of Midway itself, while well realised, is told a little too quickly. The Japanese attack on USS Yorktown is again covered in a single VFX shot with one line of dialogue from an observing carrier when it could have been such a nail biting moment. The tension that is achieved in the original movie between the Naval Commanders on both sides making the tricky tactical decisions in the battle is a little compacted here. We see the last batch of Japanese pilots taking off but we don't see the outcome of this decision nor get a sense of the damage they do to the Americans. Time spent earlier in the movie building up to events at Midway would have been better spent covering the key events of the actual battle itself, which though nicely staged, feels a little rushed at times. Although a fistful of scenes give us the Japanese perspective they don't show would have been crucial moments of drama such as the belief that their single strike on the Yorktown gave way to believed rumours that two American carriers had been sunk, and the initial spotting of the American fleet by their pilots is not shown at all.That said the stakes of the climatic battle are well realised here and the CGI is NOT poor, nor distracting as others have claimed, it is extremely well done and is far more effective and real on the big screen. You forget your watching visual FX after a point, which one assumes, is the whole idea. Where the earlier Midway film failed in its visuals of the battle, here you're really put in the seat of the plunging dive bomber or on the deck of the carrier during the numerous actions. It is a visceral experience to see these sequences on the big screen and one that shouldn't be missed.Credit too must go to Casting Director ANDREA KENYON. It can't have been easy to get such a great ensemble of actors together for one picture (the scheduling must have been a nightmare) and the scale of the film certainly demands and receives a top quality line-up. Ed Skrein is appropriately cocky as pilot Dick Best, while Patrick Wilson adds appropriate gravitas as the intelligence officer whose warnings about an imminent Japanese attack were previously ignored. They're backed up by an engaging Woody Harrelson, Dennis Quaid and the criminally underused Mark Rolston, who are all excellent playing the senior officers, while the younger cast including Keean Johnson, Nick Jonas, Luke Kleintank and Daren Criss, all do well to make the most of their parts. Given their limited screen time, credit must also be given to the Japanese cast - It says a great deal that the scene where Rear Admiral Yamaguchi elects to go down with his ship is one of the most moving in the film and creates much sympathy for the Japanese navy who were against the war with the USA from the very beginning. (Their evil actions depicted elsewhere are not spared however ,with the execution of American POWs gruesomely depicted)Director Roland Emmerich, whilst having made some past turkeys, is an extremely competent film maker who can handle both scale, multiple characters and action sequences without them turning into an unwatchable 'what the hell is happening now' Micheal Bay snoozefest. We can tell what is happening to whom and there is always a sense of where things are taking place and why in relation to the story. Dialogue is functional to mediocre so while not a flawless film, I have no doubt that several scenes were cut to make sure the film hit a manageable running time. There is a huge thirst for well made historical epics set within this time peroid and a strongly urge both the film makers and the studio to release a longer version of the film on other formats, especially if it covers more aspects of the later battle. This will push what is already a good film to the next level."
Midway,06-Nov-19,"The events of December 7th 1941 left an indelible mark on the psyche of America and became a date that truly has lived in infamy. Though historians, authors, and filmmakers have attempted to analyze the events during and leading to the attack on Pearl Harbor; there is still a great deal of interest about the attack and the aftermath.While Pearl Harbor was for many the opening shots of the U.S. entry into World War II; some would say that the stage was set earlier when the United States attempted to curtail what they saw as an aggressive and Imperialistic Japan by placing restrictions on their vital resources such as oil and the tonnage of their Navy.In the new film ""Midway"" we are given a glimpse into this when four years before the attack, when Edwin Layton (Patrick Wilson) meets with Admiral Nagumo (Jun Kunimura) who lets him know that hardline factions in his government have been buoyed by their invasion of China and will do what is needed to make sure the vital oil that is supplied by the U.S. remains constant.
Flash forward to the day of the attack and Layton who has warned that an attack was possible at Pearl Harbor is seeing his worst predictions come true. In the aftermath he is assigned to Admiral Nimitz (Woody Harrelson); who has been given the thankless task of taking charge of what is left of the Pacific Fleet and finding a way to stop the Japanese fleet.The U.S. finds themselves outnumbered, outgunned, and waging war with ships and planes that are inferior to the Japanese but they must find a way to overcome the great obstacles before them and defeat a relentless enemy.
Layton and a team of code breakers are convinced the Japanese intend to attack the island of Midway and go all in to set a trap with the goal of destroying the enemy carriers so the U.S. can gain an aerial advantage in the Pacific.With a strong cast which features Luke Evans, Dennis Quaid, Mandy Moore, Aaron Eckhart, Nick Jonas and a fine supporting cast, Director Roland Emmerich has given audiences a gripping war movie that despite the impressive visual effects; never loses site of the fact that this is a story of real people who found themselves in pivotal moments of history.The film also shows how the Japanese commanders had differing views of the Americans they fought. Some considered them to lack braveness while others admired their tenacity and were grateful that they had what they saw as inferior and outdated planes to attack them in.The film also does a great job showing the Doolittle Raid and how what from a military standpoint caused minor damage yet was a huge psychological boost as Japan believed they were immune from attack yet the American forces found a way to bomb Tokyo by the impossible task of using land based bombers off a carrier.The film is a great mix of human drama that shows not only the terrible toll of war but how a group of extraordinary individuals gave their all.4.5 stars out of 5"
Midway,09-Nov-19,"When I first saw the previews of this movie, I feared another ridiculous and distorted movie like the 2001 movie, Pearl Harbor. I was relieved it was not. It is amazing how many specific details of the early days of the Pacific War are crammed into this movie. So many that only those already familiar with the battles will be able to spot them all.Although I am a former Naval Aviator, kudos to the writers to giving the Marine Aviators and Army Air Corps their due credit in the battle of Midway, something the 1976 movie neglected. Only one minor disappointment in that the sacrifice of the three American Torpedo Bombing squadrons was underplayed.I suspect those not familiar with history will not be able to keep up with all the details portrayed, but outstanding job by Roland Emmerich for even trying.PS. To the dude below about the glaring historical accuracy, you are correct. Midway was reinforced with a detachment of B-26 bombers armed with torpedoes. One of the did make a suicide run at IJN Akagi, which prompted Admiral Nagumo to prepare for a second air attack on Midway Island, only to reverse his decision when one of his cruiser's scout plane's spotted one of the American task forces, all of which contributed to ordnance to be stacked all over the Akagi's hanger bay when LT Richard Best's single bomb detonated inside the Akagi, causing an inferno that doomed the ship."
Midway,11-Nov-19,"I'm just coming from the cinema, Midway is a worth to see movie, but the filmmakers used a bit too much CGI, sometimes you feel like watching a Medal of Honor game trailer."
Midway,05-Nov-19,A bit Hollywood but a good movie. Much better than the embarrassment of the movie Pearl Harbor.
Midway,10-Nov-19,"Seeing the trailers and early critics reviews, I expected a movie similar the 2001 Pearl Harbor- a film dominated by the sappy ""love triangle"".
""Midway"" while not perfect, did not fall into the same trap. Overall, the film focuses on the battles from the attack on Pearl Harbor through Midway.The best parts of the movie are the battle scenes, which in the end save the movie. The special effects are very good, although some are over the top, like the laser-like machine gun fire and powerful some over the top explosions.The film would have been better without the omnipresent loud background music that over powered the dialog. The acting was decent, but the scenes switched rapidly from one to the next, so few individual scenes lasted more than a couple of minutes. This lead to little character development. War movie cliches in the dialog were frequent.The film would have been better had it focused solely on the Battle of Midway- the intelligence effort to discover the Japanese attack plans, the preparations for the defense of Midway, the deployment of the U.S. naval forces, the actual battle.In the end it was decent entertainment; saved by the battle scenes. Not a war movie at the level of quality as ""Dunkirk"", but not as disappointing as ""Pearl Harbor""."
Midway,11-Nov-19,"So my boys (9) liked it... especially the action sequences. I on the other hand didn't. Some good stars but all lacking any sense of believable performance, with a script that lacked narrative, coherence or direction just lots of cliches and other words. Given the Historic event and the heroism associated with it, just how Emmerich managed to produce something so uninspiring and lifeless is beyond me. The back and forth between the front and the home is laughable. Cardboard cut out Japanese characters and superficial un-engaging American heroes were boring, the action sequences overblown and exaggerated up-to and including planes flying through wave tips and the wreckage of other planes only to emerge unscathed, combined to stretch credibility to beyond breaking point. 2hrs and 18 mins of my life that I will never get back."
Midway,08-Nov-19,This was a great flick fro beginning to end. Plane fight after plane fight. Great film. I don't understand the bad reviews I really dont. It was enjoyable and I certainly liked it.
Midway,26-Dec-19,"Oof this movie had a lot of potential and was a bigger disappointment than I was expecting. It had so much going for it too that it should have been much better than it ended up being.The movie had its good points along with its draw backs though. The cast of this film was outstanding and I was pleasantly surprised every time a new big name actor popped up on screen, I was really not expecting that. But even with all that star power the movie fell short, the overwhelming cast is really the only big positive for this film and the general historical story that it told.The movie does cover much much more than just the battle of Midway and jumps around quite a bit. That wasn't bad necessarily but it left you trying to follow lots of major events that happened during World War 2. This could be perfectly fine if done a little better but over all was not the end of the world.The two biggest things that were the downfall of this movie were the main character and the general look of the film. Ed Skrein is absolutely abysmal in this movie, his acting was bad, the depiction of a historical figure was terrible and the fake accent he was trying to do was just grating in all regards. He was such a bad choice for this film and brought down the stellar performances of all the much more seasoned and proven actors who were in this.The movie is almost all done CGI which was to be expected after all but it looks so cartoonish and bad. The entire time I was watching it I was wondering how this new film could make this all look so bad when it had been done in the past and looked so much better. The best example would be Pearl Harbor from 2001. That film used CGI as well but it looked so much better. I wish who ever had been in charge of visuals for that movie had done this one too. It took you out of the epic events that they were showing.If you are in the mood for a good World War 2 movie look else where. I have no intention of ever seeing this again and viewed it as more a wast of time than anything else."
Midway,09-Nov-19,Far better than what I thought it would be. Tense War movie. I really enjoyed this movie which is based on true life events. Please don't think this movie is anything like the pearl harbour movie because it isn't.
Midway,17-Nov-19,Overdone special effects. The story was historically accurate but the plot was pretty boring. Maybe they tried to cover too much time in one movie. The 1976 Midway was much better
Midway,09-Nov-19,"This remake of the original 1976 movie was much more historically correct. It was obvious that everyone involved researched and studied the history behind the greatest naval battle in history! Kudos to all the actors, directors and producers for making an entertaining and quality movie!"
Joker,10-Sep-19,"I was a person that saw all the hype and claims of masterpiece as overreacting and overblown excitement for another Joker based film. I thought this looked solid at best and even a bit too pretentious in the trailer, but in here to say I was incredibly wrong. This is a massive achievement of cinema that's extremely rare in a day and age of cgi nonsense and reboots. While this is somewhat of a reboot of sorts, the standalone origin tale is impeccable from start to finish and echoes resemblance to the best joker origin comics from the past. Joaquin bleeds, sweats, and cries his every drop into this magnificently dedicated performance. Heath Ledger would be proud. This is undoubtedly the greatest acting performance since Heath's joker. The directing and writing is slickly brilliant and the bleak settings and tones are palpable throughout. When this film was over the place was blown away and every audience member was awestruck that they witnessed a film that could still transport them into a character's world and very existence. Believe the hype. This is going to be revered as a transcending masterpiece of cinema."
Joker,03-Oct-19,"Every once in a while a movie comes, that truly makes an impact. Joaquin's performance and scenography in all it's brilliance. Grotesque, haunting and cringy. Hard to watch at times,... but so mesmerizing, you won't blink an eye watching it. Tragic, but with seriously funny moments. Emotional rollercoaster - sometimes, with multiple emotions popping-up at the same time.this is far from a typical action-riddled predictable super-hero movie - it's a proper psychological thriller/drama, with the single best character development I have ever seen."
Joker,07-Oct-19,"This is a movie that only those who have felt alone and isolated can truly relate to it. You understand the motive and you feel sorry for the character. A lot of people will see this movie and think that it encourages violence. But truly, this movie should encourage each and every one of us to become a better person, treat everyone with respect and make each other feel like they belong in this world, instead of making them feel isolated."
Joker,01-Sep-19,"Truly a masterpiece, The Best Hollywood film of 2019, one of the Best films of the decade... And truly the Best film to bring a comic book so chillingly and realistically to real ife.
Remarkable Direction, Cinematography, Music and the Acting.
Some people are surprised to find it DISTURBING and VIOLENT, but it's a necessity and message.
It's about society and reflects those underappreciated/unrecognized/bullied people, proving they can do something too.
The way it shows class difference, corruption and how rich and talented rule others around them is not exaggerated and that's what makes it different.
It's BELIEVABLE.
There could be multiple JOKERs living in our society that could shake those around them in much bitter way than the film shows making people uncomforting people.
Consider this a wake up call, a message, but first a film. A PERFECT film."
Joker,01-Sep-19,"Joaquin Phoenix gives a tour de force performance, fearless and stunning in its emotional depth and physicality. It's impossible to talk about this without referencing Heath Ledger's Oscar-winning performance from The Dark Knight, widely considered the definitive live-action portrayal of the Joker, so let's talk about it. The fact is, everyone is going to be stunned by what Phoenix accomplishes, because it's what many thought impossible - a portrayal that matches and potentially exceeds that of The Dark Knight's Clown Prince of Crime"
Joker,04-Oct-19,"Most of the time movies are anticipated like this they end up falling short, way short. Joker is the first time I was more than happy with the hype. Please ignore the complaints of ""pernicious violence"" as they are embarrassing to say the least. We haven't seen a comic movie this real before. If we ever ""deserved"" a better class of criminal - Phillips and Phoenix have delivered. This is dark, Joker IS dark and you will fall in love with the villain as you should. The bad guys are always more romantic anyway."
Joker,04-Oct-19,"Let me start off by saying if Joaquin Phoneix doesn't get his Oscar for this movie. Then the Oscars should be cancelled. Phoneix is amazing as you might've heard from every review ever! But Todd Phillips. Is at his best here. The story lines he takes and visuals are just breathtaking. The score!! Omg the Score! Every time that score came on, I felt very uncomfortable, like something horrible was about to happen. It was GREAT. The Inspirations from Taxi Driver and King of Comedy are there, and add so much for the movie. And I got to be honest. There are scenes that are very violent. And its disturbing. But I honestly expected it to be WAYYYY more violent from all the controversy going on. Overall this movie was GREAT. Come Oscar season, it needs to be nominated for Best Picture, ScreenPlay, Cinematography, Actor, Score and Director"
Joker,03-Oct-19,"I get why some people hate this . It's because of the political message and how some people think that you need get empathy for Arthur's madness. But come on that is not the point and it will never be. Enjoy this masterpiece because Joaquin Phoenix and Todd Phillips overdid themselves with this movie . The acting,music and cinematography are just amazing ! Please enjoy the movie without overthinking it."
Joker,01-Sep-19,"I have seen Joker yesterday at Venice an early ill-fated screening. We had some trouble with audio that lead to a near-hour delay, but it definitely was worth it.Joker deserved to be presented at Venice Film Festival, an event that regards cinema as a form of art, because this film is far from a blockbuster or a mere entertainer movie, as most films in the genre are.It focuses on the psyche of the main character, as it slowly crumbles under the pressure of society. And thus, Joaquin Phoenix does a wonderful performance, earning almost surely a nomination at the oscars at least.
It's a take on the Joker that differs from Ledger's, but I'd say that both are equally as good. The main difference might be that Ledger's joker is a rational that acts insane, while Phoenix's is insane to the root.Despite being a movie about a superhero villain, Joker is much superior to most of the movies of the genre (I'd exclude the Dark Knight Trilogy only, but Joker is easily as good as Nolan's movies, or at least very close). It is a small-scaled film, with a distinct style and cinematography (that cannot but be appreciated) and a set of very cinephile references that however do not feel too forced or overly opressive. (most notable are the similarities to Scorsese's 'Taxi Driver' and his 'The King of Comedy', but also Chaplin's 'Modern Times' is somewhat referenced).I am eager to see more non-comedic efforts by Todd Phillips. This movie was so far probably the best of 2019 (at worst contested so far only by Dolor Y Gloria or Once Upon a Time in Hollywood), and that should be very convincing."
Joker,01-Sep-19,"It's sad that Joaquin missed Oscar for 'The gladiator' as he was very compelling Villain. But I am quite confident he will win it for the 'Joker'. Damn what a movie !!! Keeps u on the toes all the time. Unpredictable storyline and really a deep interesting plot. Did I forget to mention acting ? Damn Do niro and Joaquin teach u what really is 5 star acting.
To enjoy this movie, get a wine in your hand, close the curtains, turn of ur cellphones and put do not disturb sign on ur door. Best Dark thriller suspense movie you will get to experience."
Joker,01-Sep-19,"I have just watched the Joker in Venice and I will say if Joaquin doesn't get an Oscar this year then something is wrong with this world. This perfomance is just jaw-dropping, it glues you to the screen and doesn't let go till the end. Story is very good and has some interesting connections with Batman lore(especially one you can't guess from trailers). There are some scenes that are so tense ,well-acted and imaginative that push this movie to 10. Cinematography and direction are great, Todd has proven himself as a director. Robert is also good in his ""small"" role. Will definitely see it again as soon as it out in October."
Joker,15-Oct-19,"There is no doubt that the movie was well thought of - from the plot to execution. I must praise Phoenix's superb acting. He managed to portray very believably the awkward social reject and also the crazy murderer that he became. I really think it's a role only few could do. It was also very interesting to watch how he deteriorated mentally and little by little gave up on trying to fit into society. Gotta hand it to the script writer - the plot was unpredictable.But...There wasn't anything too complex about Arthur's mental state. No deep psychological analysis, or a web of many deep factors that created a one of a kind psychotic maniac. Could it be that I was expecting too much? Very possible since I came with very high expectations after reading some reviews.
What doesn't have anything with expectations is that at the end he didn't remind much of the original Joker. He felt more like a simply society reject that went completely crazy and started killing people. Not that much different from many other serial killers or mass murderers. He didn't have the master mind that so much designated the Joker and made him different from a simple murderer.
Another thing is that there were long parts of the movie that felt very dull.
Also I found it hard to buy the reason behind the riots in the city and the role the Joker played in them. Even if taken into account that the poverty and anger was cooking for a long time in that society, it still feels somewhat absurd that killing three people in the subway made the joker so notorious.
In conclusion, I can identify with the character which gave me a lasting impression of the movie, and this movie could have been very great if it was a movie about how a person that's rejected by society turns slowly into a serial killer. But as a movie about the Joker I felt it was lacking. Lacking the things that made the Joker actually the Joker, and not just another crazy murderer."
Joker,04-Oct-19,"This movie causes the audience to consider many topics on morality, particularly the poor choices made by the Joker. The Joker is more relatable in this movie than antagonists usually are. I think this gives a more realistic view of ""bad"" people, who are not usually 100% bad in all ways as society often judges. It is important to know when to sympathize with the Joker (towards the beginning of the movie), and when he needs to be identified as a threat (when he begins making certain bad choices). This movie is only suitable for adults who are willing to pick it apart and think critically about it. It isn't for light amusement. That substance is what makes it so good.If you aren't able to ponder underlying themes on your own, and you have to be handed all your thoughts to you, then this isn't the best movie for you."
Joker,05-Oct-19,"The movie affects you in a way that makes it physically painful to experience, but in a good way."
Joker,06-Oct-19,"The acting, cinematography, sound design, and the script itself is phenomenal. This movie is a triumph. Joaquin Pheonix deserves an Oscar win for this tbh."
Joker,02-Sep-19,"Need I say more? Everything about this Movie is Masterful in every single way! Joker isn't just an awesome comic book movie, it's an awesome movie, period. It offers no easy answers to the unsettling questions it raises about a cruel society in decline. Joaquin Phoenix's fully committed performance and Todd Phillips' masterful albeit loose reinvention of the DC source material make Joker a film that should leave comic book fans and non-fans alike disturbed and moved in all the right ways."
Joker,03-Oct-19,I will stop watching movies if Joaquin Phoenix is not awarded Oscar for his tremendous acting.
Joker,06-Oct-19,"I quit relying on critic reviews years ago... I noticed for this movie that the critics ratings were low but viewer ratings were high. That being said, what is the point of a critic when for this movie, they are oh so wrong.
I went and saw this tonite with my mom. I went in skeptical and w some what low expectations. I knew not to expect your typical super hero movie.
What we got was a masterpiece. I went in expecting sheer boredom and I was instead on the edge of my seat the whole time. Not action edge of your seat, it was a fear of what he may do or say next edge of your seat. To see this character evolve into what we all know as the #1 villain of Batman was beyond genius and Joaquin Phoenix is a true master at perfecting the art of consuming himself into this character. I may be all over the place with this but I don't care. This movie, the story, the acting, directing, effects, everyone brought their A game and JP definitely deserves a nod and win for this role. And no, there is no comparison here to Jack Nicholson or Heath Ledger. Each actor took on this character and different levels, different story points and different points in time, so any comparison would just not be feasible or fair to any of the actors as they embraced him and made him come to life in their own genius way!"
Joker,04-Oct-19,"Joaquin Phoenix IS the joker. Phoenix gave a performance that felt like a mixture of Heath Ledger's joker, Jack Nicholson's joker, and Alex in A Clockwork Orange:Overall, this movie was a trip to say the least. Cinematography was very good, and the soundtrack set the perfect mood for the film for the most part. The acting and plot are what sold it though. Phoenix made me forget that the character was one I had seen before in other movies. His performance mixed with the overall feel and plot of the movie made me leave the theater feeling like I too had just taken a descent into madness.I've never been a very big fan of superhero movies so I was a little weary going into the movie, but this had absolutely nothing to do with anything superhero related other than the characters. I loved this movie and will definitely see it again. It was just what I hoped it would be."
Joker,23-Oct-19,"I went into this film expecting an all-time classic based on the reviews I had read & what I ended up watching was just a decent film overall. Phoenix is outstanding...so he definitely did his part. But I feel like if you've seen the trailers you've seen the movie because the best way I can describe this film is it feels like a 2 hour version of the trailer. At 2 hours it's a relatively common runtime, but it felt a lot longer...which isn't good. I'd say this is much more of a rental than a theater movie. Kinda just....eh."
Joker,06-Oct-19,"I thought this film was good but I just don't get the hype personally. The acting was amazing and the film was good overall but I think 'masterpiece' and 'film of the year' are a bit overused throughout the reviews. In no way did I dislike this film, I thought it was really good, just overhyped. I feel as though a lot of the 10/10 reviews are purely based on the fact that it already has amazing reviews and so people want to carry the praise further and that it is about the joker. If this film was released and was about some random guy in the same situation, I don't think the reviews would be as high but maybe that's the point."
Joker,09-Jan-20,"Do not really understand all the tens here. Sure, a good movie, good acting, nice shooting. But the plot is not so intriguing. At times it is really long and somewhat boring. I needed to double-check the genre to see if this is a drama or what. Crime, drama, thriller it said. I would put it maybe 90% in the drama and rest in thriller.I miss more dialogue, more depth, more substance. The plot is really not more then a somewhat crazy person becoming a bit crazier. Sure there is an undertone in that it is society and the system and the mean character of people that is bringing him down and creating the evil beast which later wants to destroy everything. Absolutely, but I think it is not intriguing story and plot and dialogue enough to give this a ten.Worthy of watching, yes. But not amazing"
Joker,01-Dec-19,"Joker is directed by Todd Philips and stars Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck, a man disregarded and thrown out of society.We live in an era in which formulaic comic book movies are more and more common. Joker not only proves that you can make a comic book movie without a villain but also proves that comic book movies can be used as psychological studies reflecting on how our society views and treats mental health issues of certain individuals.If I had to describe Joaquin Phoenix as the Joker in one word it would be mesmerising. His take on the iconic comic book character is filled with emotional depth to the point where it's almost painful to watch and flawlessly realistic making it one of the best performances of the decade.The cinematography is also something to note. It is full of gorgeous shots with a beautiful colour palette making it's shot composition and structure heavily differ from most comic book films.The score is very minimalistic but every time it comes on it feels unsettling and haunting which adds to the suspense of the story.My biggest and only issue with Joker is that it's too inspired by Scorsese's King of Comedy and Taxi Driver making the majority of the film predictable. However, making it predictable didn't take away much from its quality and only made it more unsettling because we can see the degradation of Joker's mind before it happens making this film more depressing.I wouldn't really call Joker a comic book movie. Yes, it's based on a comic book and depicts arguably the most iconic comic book character of all time, but it stands alone among dozens of its predecessors as a psychological drama that reflects on society and its issues rather than a fantasy world.Overall, Joker is a brilliant take on the character, however, it's not for the faint of heart or narrow-minded and prejudiced people.Final Grade - 9/10"
Joker,25-Oct-19,"When I heard everyone saying that this is the film of the year and all the reviews flooding in with 10's, I was quite hyped and excited for this movie. When I walked out of the cinema, I felt hollow and empty.Before I continue writing, let me say this, This is NOT the film of the year nor is it a real masterpiece. The cinematography is excellent and the acting is incredible, that's just it. The side-characters are bland and overly dramatic. The plot heavily relies on plot-twists and the film is so harsh that it actually falls flat on it's face.Are there no good points though? Phoenix is phenomenal and the score is great. The cinematography is also incredible but the plot is not that great at all. It even has plot holes and scenes that left me empty.Film of the year? Nope."
Joker,20-Oct-19,"I know this is an unpopular opinion, but honestly this movie is overrated and boring. 2 hours felt like 3 and a half.I don't buy the whole thing where he is invited to the show. The meta ""standup"" he made was extremely dull and boring. Then gets allowed to broadcast for that long without being interrupted, also being transported in the most shitty police-car ever after that, it's just not believeable enough to me.He also acted the same when he was on meds aswell as off, so that part didn't make sense either. The police must also be really not catching this guy faster after the homocide.It has some good parts but they can be boiled down to maybe 5 minutes.
Is this a movie I would watch again? Probably not."
Avengers: Endgame,24-Apr-19,"There is no way that I could describe my emotions for this movie. I'm totally speechless. I haven't laughed (even cried) this much in Marvel movie or even in any movie. I'm fully on my emotion, there are so many tears of joy and loss. Amazing story, the acting is outstanding, epic action, great CGI, the best storytelling ever told in a superhero movie, amazing performance. I love it more than 3000.Happiness, sadness, pure joy, excitement... I'm gonna miss this moment in my whole life because let's face it- it's been awhile movies can bring such a big enthusiasm like this.It is such an experience you'll gonna remember it forever. People are clapping, laughing, crying, full of a state emotion. It's 3 hours long but it went by like a finger snapping by Thanos, and now I'm thinking I'm actually in Quantum Realm because it felt like 5 seconds. Even though you know where the story is gonna bring you because it's still a 'superhero movie' but it left me speechless. It's not just a superhero movie, it's more than that.**SPOILER ALERT**Even some characters that you didn't like before, you will love them in this movie. Like Captain Marvel. I didn't like her before in her own movie but in Endgame they showed how powerful, how strong and how capable she really is. And now I kinda love her! But Marvel should really be careful of her line though, I didn't like some of her line like ""I'm the strongest"" and ""You didn't win because before you didn't have me"" duh. Also not gonna forget Hawkeye. To be honest, in Avengers I really didn't like Hawkeye because he's just a 'guy' with an arrow and just randomly showed up in any scene but actually he's character is so BADASS! Everything that we need, what we want is here.Also I don't get it why some people can not accept that Thor is fat or treat him like a joke. I mean, this movie might be trying to give us a message about no matter what 'shape' are you, you can be a hero and save the world. To be honest, I like what they did to Thor, that man is depressed and taking the most responsible after he missed the shot to kill Thanos in Infinity War. Even though he already did killed him but it's not gonna bring back his people of Asgard. Also he's God of Thunder for god sake, he could slap his stomach with thunder and got his abs back.I'm so happy too for Captain America. Finally he could do his dance with Peggy and I didn't expected that we could see the fight between Captain America with his own self. Also when Tony met his father really warm my heart, and we can see the 'real-life' Jarvis - I didn't expected that too.When the whole superhero arrived it is so EPIC! The whole person in theater are screaming and shocked. Gives me a goosebumps and still left me speechless!This movie is absolute perfection. The ending of this movie is we and the characters deserved. It gives a perfect balance for all these past 10 years. Epic and perfect ending, I was not disappointed at all. This movie was completely emotional and visually stunning. Now I get it why the Russo Brothers told us to do a Marvel Movie marathon before watching Endgame because this movie had everything to accomplish what left behind before all of this.Ready or not, whatever it takes.Go watch it for yourself."
Avengers: Endgame,26-Apr-19,"I have to say, my first reaction walking out of the cinema was that it was great. Probably an 8/10. You know there's so much fan service in this movie and I particularly loved the ""I can do this all day"" CA line from one CA to another. It was almost Toy Story 2, enlightened Buzz to naive Buzz banter.I loved Clever Hulk, found Thor hilarious, though a bit annoying at times, and loved the references to past movies. Cap swinging Mjollnir around was beautiful.The deaths in this movie were also pretty surprising but I agree with some of the more balanced reviews in here that it was bizarre that so much time was spent on Hawkeye - does anyone really care about him? Not really.Killing off Black Widow was a surprising touch, but I, like many others, probably felt more of an emotional reaction to Banner's relationship with her and not Hawkeye (because no one actually cares about him). Renner, as an actor, just doesn't cut it much, unfortunately.The real problem with End Game, is the time travel. I don't know why any movie franchise would ever want to deal with time travel knowing how much grief it creates. Sure they try to explain everything with their hilarious conversation about movies, but in the end, there are just too many questions left at the end of the day, particularly when they already try to explain it through the Ancient One.The most glaring one of these is, if they change the past, they're changing another timeline, so how selfish is that? If Tony Stark snaps his fingers and kills Thanos, what happens to that original timeline? If he sent Thanos and everyone back, how does he magically know not to send Gamora back who is now stuck in 2023 - and so does that mean 2014 Quill never meets Gamora?!? What the hell? Essentially erasing the entire 2014 GOTG franchise in that universe. If Captain America goes back in time, he will inevitably change history in some way or another, so that is another timeline, right? So while everyone else's timeline is meant to stay the same in the present (as said by Stark) how does Cap end up sitting by the same lake as everyone else.There are also way too many questions about new timelines created - but perhaps that is intentional, such as the Loki TV show. But this is why I hate it when they bring time travel into any movie and just add stuff to it to make it wrap up nicely in their own universe.Also, don't get me started on how impossibly strong Thanos suddenly is without an infinity gauntlet? Even WITH the IG he couldn't stop Thor's Stormbringer, but now without the IG can easily defeat Thor with Stormbringer AND Mjollnir, Iron Man and Cap??? How convenient.I also think Marvel made a serious mistake creating Captain Marvel, how is she brought in as a convenient deus ex machina and yet doesn't really stick around to show off all her abilities, and she can't even defeat Thanos single handedly? Pfft. That was rich. She can barely prevent Thanos from snapping his fingers, yet in Infinity War, Cap was able to actually hold off his hand too? Bizarre parallels.So okay, sure, it was enjoyable to watch, but I just feel that there are too many plot inconsistencies creeping into End Game. There should have been better ways to get the infinity stones back, and I think someone stupid just thought time travel was the best way to do it,."
Avengers: Endgame,25-Apr-19,"After Avengers Infinity War, we waited for the Avengers Endgame. We wondered how the story would go on, how our heroes would turn back, what would be the end of Thanos. Many theories related to this have been put forward. Avengers Endgame was undoubtedly the most anticipated film of recent years. Normally, the higher the expectation, the higher the probability of disappointment. But this is not the case for Endgame. Whatever you're expecting, you find much more in the film. This means that the biggest concern about the film has disappeared.On the other hand, another comparison comes up. Is Endgame more successful than Infinity War? We can comfortably say it Avengers Infinity War is just the beginning of the story. Endgame was the finale of the story. So we shouldn't think of these two films as two separate stories. There is only one story divided into two parts.Avengers Endgame is, above all, a great homage to the ten-year history of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The story highlights the original Avengers team. Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye are at the center of events. No character comes in front of them. Of course there are many characters that play an important role in the story outside the original Avengers team. Everyone's concern was that Captain Marvel, who was included in the Marvel world, overshadowed other heroes. We can say that this certainly did not happen. What is important in this struggle is not how strong you are, but how good you are. This comes to the fore in all areas. It gives good message about being a hero and a family.Of course, Avengers Endgame has some critical aspects. For example, is the three-hour period necessary in terms of the story? It can be discussed. The head of the story moves much slower than the rest. It also drags the heroes into an emotional predicament. Then the tempo is rising and the heavy scenes we are watching are getting more meaningful. The last 45 minutes of the movie is fully action packed. But the last 45 minutes goes so fast that you don't even realize it. Action and battle scenes are really successful. There is not even a slight distress about visual effects. There are also slight logic errors in the film, but in general the story is so successful that these details become meaningless and insignificant after a certain point.Lastly, Avengers Endgame doesn't have a movie end scene. Because after the film's final, there is no need for another scene. The Marvel legend Stan Lee appears with a small stage. But this is the last surprise scene in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Moreover, there is no clue about Marvel's future. This makes us wonder more about Spider-Man: Far from Home. 10/10"
Avengers: Endgame,24-Apr-19,"If you're going to watch this movie, avoid any spoilers, even spoiler free reviews.
Which is why I'm not going to say anything about the movie. Not even my opinion. All I'm going to say is:The crowd applauded 3 times during the movie, and stood up to clap their hands after. This I have never witnessed in a Dutch cinema. Dutch crowds aren't usually passionate about this. I checked the row where I was sitting, and people were crying. After the movie, I was seeing people with smudged mascara. That's all I have to say about the movie."
Avengers: Endgame,25-Apr-19,"Unpopular opinion.
Let me start by saying that Endgame is not a bad film. In fact it was a decent film. But nothing more. Maybe I was expecting a masterpiece like Infinity War due to all this hype.
The first 2 hours of the movie are really boring. They try to build up many emotional moments only to destroy them with a joke the next minute. And there are really MANY jokes that feel out of place.
Endgame uses the previous marvel movies to give you a good story, without building it itself. It's like the writers didn't care to give us a proper story. They just filled it with many dramatic moments. Also, there was no action in the first 120 minutes.
Plus, I did not like the way they treated Thor at all. They made him a comic relief in the worst way possible. I wonder how Thor fans feel after watching this.
The last battle was epic and beautiful but that's all I really enjoyed. The cgi was top notch.
Also, the way they ended Cap's story, meh... Yeah we got it, you want to make people cry and give us the end of an era, but at least do it without creating dozens of plot holes.
The 3 hours went by fast, but I wouldn't watch it again in theaters (I had planned to watch it at least 1 more time).
This could be so damn good... Disappointed.*edit* Also, all of you fanboys who downvote all my reviews because you got angry because I gave your beloved Avengers a 6, you are just amusing and pathetic. Get a life."
Avengers: Endgame,04-May-19,"I've just come from watching Endgame and I must say that I am disappointed.I loved Civil War and I loved Infinity War. When I came out of those films, I knew immediately that they were great and that I wanted to see them again. With Endgame, I'm not sure.I respect how they were prepared to show the consequences of what Thanos had done but by killing him off so quickly and then them having to do their own stone quest (hadn't we already seen Thanos doing this in IW) it felt slow and lazy. Worse still was that it felt very self-indulgent and attempting to be clever for clever sake.Like how Back to the Future II considered itself clever for showing the events of the first film but with Marty flitting around behind the scenes to ensure that it all still happened. I know it's meant to be fan pleasing but it really felt like a gimmick and lacking in confidence. Almost like it was saying 'Hey guys, this will make you smile'. If you want to make me smile, concentrate on maintaining the quality of your product rather than directly trying to make me like you.But the trouble with messing around with timelines and bouncing around is that it makes the audience start asking questions during the film. The linearity that we'd seen in IW and the imminent fast approaching threat is replaced in Endgame with a lack of direction and characters that are earlier versions of who the audience have seen.In IW we were shown Thanos. He was written to be sympathetic or at least a character that we the audience could understand. He believed in what he was doing and this made him more rounded. But in Endgame, that version is dispatched quickly and we are supplied with a 2014 (?) Thanos who isn't the character we know but is just a token bad guy.This Thanos hasn't made the sacrifice at Vormire, he isn't the guy that would empathise with Scarlet Witch for what she did to Vision. He has suddenly become a token cut out evil bad guy that needs to be defeated. Hell, the writers even manage to forget their own time loop by saying that this Thanos has learnt that he doesn't want to wipe out 50% anymore because they are too ungrateful. How does he know this when the 2014 Thanos has only just literally arrived in the post wipeout Universe? How has he had time to form the opinion that his previous quest for a 50% cull isn't worthy?Is this a case of the writers being terrified that they had created a bad guy that people related to or was it a fear that they'd written themselves into a hole? Why go to the effort of creating that character in IW to suddenly kill him off at the beginning of Endgame just for a dramatic punch?For me, the time travelling and stone gathering wasted time to create unimportant scenes that fundamentally undermine the films that came before.
In my opinion it would have been better if they had shown the remaining Avengers preparing to do some Avenging and maintained the single minded linearity of IW of battling towards and reaching a post click Thanos and somehow reversing his work.The more I think of the film, the more plot holes and frustrations manifest themselves. Thor's drinking and man child antics might have been initially funny but one begins to realise that they are deliberately doing this to clip his wings. Likewise with Hulk, his primordial desire to smash and destroy has been removed to think it out and he has become an embarrassing shadow of his former self.The thing that is meant to be amazing about the MCU is the world building but inconsistencies have been appearing and there are so many in Endgame that it makes you question whether these two films are written by the same people.In IW, Thanos is a dangerous and credible threat because he has the infinity stones. He takes on half of the Avengers, Strange and some of the Guardians on Titan and smashes them and then takes on the other half on Wakanda and smashes them. Yet it is Stormbreaker (whose creation we have seen been hard earned by a motivated Thor) that has the power to take down Thanos even when he has a full complement of Infinity Stones.Yet we roll forward to Endgame and we have literally all the good guys together in one place, Cap with his shield, Tony fully powered up, Scarlet Witch p*ssed and vengeful, Capt Marvel who can seemingly do anything and Thor wielding both Mjolnir AND Stormbreaker and Thanos NOT in possession of the gauntlet, yet they can't defeat him.It's like the fights in IW were so amazing because the good guys were taking on an unbeatable foe yet here he is now seemingly defeatable by the 'rules' that the writers established . A good example of this would be in IW when Cap is the last man standing before Scarlet Witch and he grabs the gauntlet. You see the look of admiration/respect on Thanos' face that Cap is holding open the gauntlet before he punches him to the ground yet now that scene seems pointless.The writers for Endgame seem to have been driven to undo everything they did in IW. All the tension, all the sacrifice, all the development of Thanos discarded for well, I don't know what. It makes no sense.IW had two incredible scenes that used to choke me up. When Cap appears in the train station, the Avengers theme kicks in and Falcon and Widow take down the henchman in a wonderfully choreographed scene. In just that one scene it shows them coming to the rescue, it shows how intuitively they work together and it showcases their heroism.Likewise when Thor creates Stormbreaker and makes his entrance on Wakanda, I felt it for the journey that Thor has been on. He's had to contend with loss and defeat and humiliation and this is his redemption. Here is a character that has earned his game changing weapon and when he arrives and demands to face a character that everyone else is running away from, I want to punch the air.But in Endgame, that feels like it has to be corrupted. We can't have Thor being dominant, let's break him and make him a fool. We can't have Thanos being complicated and relatable, let's make him a cut out bad guy. We can't have Hulk being rage fuelled and smashing stuff up, let's make him more sensitive and talking stuff out. We can't have Cap being stoic and heroic, let's have him ridiculing one of his own iconic lines in a silly gimmicky fight with himself and commenting on his butt. We can't have a powerful female character that we're invested in look sexy AND be able to take down Thanos, let's give Scarlet Witch a small part but focus our attention on a female character that hasn't earnt our admiration or desire for revenge.To be honest, the 'rules of engagement' had been set so well in IW that when in Endgame Thanos massed his ranks against the Avengers and then ALL of the good guys showed up, I was almost expecting the camera to pull away and not show the fight given that it was so obviously going to be an easy win for the good guys.And as for the big fight scene, it did reek of what DC always manage to do which is just throw everything into an end battle and bludgeon you with CGI and pyrotechnics so that you aren't really sure what is going on.In the many fights in IW, you knew what was going on, you recognised the combatants, you understood the stakes and you identified the geography of the scene. In Endgame we got one big massive fight where everything was thrown in the pot and it was just assumed by the directors that we would be happy with all the flashing lights.
And I have to say that considering that Steve and Tony fell out so hard, and that Tony's criticism of Steve was so unfair, that I really had hoped for more than just a handshake, a muttering of 'no worries' and 'here's your shield'. These guys wrote and directed Civil War, they created the line 'we fell out hard' and hence I had hoped for something deeper and more touching than a handshake.Steve wrote Tony a letter telling him that when he needed him he'd be there but once again the Iron Man bias had to creep in and once again Tony was the victim and the ultimate hero.But I think my biggest problem is how the convenient time travelling undermines everything. When a franchise starts retrofitting stuff (like Fury's eye being from a space cat), it's then hard to consider the previous stories.Having 2014 Gamorra means that all the evolution that we saw her go through in GOTG 1 and 2 is wasted. Having Cap marry Peggy means the pain of his sacrifice, him seeing her in Winter Soldier when she is suffering from Alzheimer's, hell even his blossoming relationship with Sharon Carter is kinda irrelevant. Having seen Thor at last step away from his two weaker origin films into the entertainment of Ragnarok and the redemption in IW leaves us now with a bumbling buffoon.We know that what makes Captain America what he is, is the serum that makes him a super soldier. That he was transformed from a weakling to a superhuman. Sam Wilson is not a super soldier and he didn't take the serum. He is Falcon. Now maybe in the comics he becomes Cap but Bucky is a super soldier. Is the new Cap going to foil an evil plot and be defeated with a tazer or a knife to the chest? Consider the beatings that Steve has taken and the physical strength that he has shown we can recognise that Sam Wilson does not have that.I'm sorry to say but the Russo's have dropped the ball. Themselves and their writers have succumbed to their success and their desire to be engineers of political correctness and social change. I thought Endgame would be the high soaring end to this 10 year run of impressive movie entertainment but in the end the writers got carried away, the directors over reached and the studio sacrificed the integrity of their product for a chance to 'educate' us all. A real shame and a wasted opportunity.Infinity War is clearly the highlight of the last 10 years but even now I fear that repeated viewings will render it pointless considering how the makers decided to fundamentally damage it."
Avengers: Endgame,27-Apr-19,"First of, Infinity War was the greatest MCU movie ever made IMHO.Of course, following it up was never going to be easy, and it's sheer greatness and the impact of the 'snap' was something that the Russos just couldn't navigate a way out of. However, plot difficulties aside, there was really no excuse for some of the poor character treatment and pacing issues that they had.Positives:
RDJ's actingNatasha and Hawkeye's last interactionsCGINegatives:
Abysmally poor treatment of Thor, reduced to a comic relief sideshowAbysmally poor treatment of the Hulk - One of the strongest characters of the MCU didn't fight more than 10secs in the 2 supposedly landmark movies of the MCU??Completely ruined Thanos - reduced to a caricature 'bad guy' after an excellently built character in IWPoor re-introduction of the vanished Avengers - seems most of the team wasn't even paid and they just used some stock footage from previous movies for their blink and you miss appearancesWasted potential of Capt Marvel - why introduce a character so powerful, and then not use them for >95% of the movie?Pacing - all over the place. Could easily have trimmed the fat and achieved a much more coherent productMore of a Cap+Stark movie than an Avengers movie.Time travel plotholes - hellloooo. I was OK with the main plan of stealing, snapping, restoring the stones. Hell, I am even OK with Cap getting the happy ending (assuming he stays in hiding his entire life and Carter's life decisions are not affected by the guy in her basement). But as soon as Thanos goes to the future and dies there, Uh Oh - did we just lose the entire Infinity War?? Maybe I am too dumb to understand this...In the end, while the homage to the movies and characters was fine, I really wanted to have a movie I would rush to watch again (Like I did with IW). Sadly, they couldn't deliver this time."
Avengers: Endgame,20-Aug-19,"This is the saddest review I have ever had to write. After the culmination of all the films and the Snap at the end of Avengers Infinity Wars they blew it. Fat Thor was funny for about 5 minutes then was just annoying, the Hulk was reduced to a joke quite frankly with none of his anger just stupid glasses. Most of the characters didn't get a look an and the first half of the film was just annoying. When the final fight does happen it is so unrealistic, with characters having bonding sessions as aliens and superheros were fighting all around them. Captain Marvel was in the film for about 10 seconds and destroyed the aliens so easily she made the rest of the characters redundant.
If the Russo Brothers had spent less time trying to get their friends and family cameo roles and more time trying to make the film we deserved it would have been a good thing. I am so disappointed in this movie it has left me heartbroken at the untimely end to what was one of my favorite film series ever.
It is a mess, the time travel was nonsensical, action was limited and the trademark humor was missing.
I have no idea what the writers and directors were thinking.
Oh and Iron Man dies"
Avengers: Endgame,06-Aug-19,"What have they done wrong with this movie ""everything""
They have turned Thor & Hulk into joke characters the whole movie feels hurried and confusing the CGI is poor on more than one occasion a lot of MCU characters are more cameos than necessary.I enjoyed the early Marvel movies but the most recent ones are ruining the franchise how they made so much £££ out of this is baffling it only gets more confusing the longer you watch it.I am not sure why so many cameos were necessary as Captain Marvel was all that was needed."
Avengers: Endgame,01-May-19,"Thanos original purpose was to give his bride The Dead itself, the half of universe´s lives, as wedding gift. The evolving thing was too sense as a goal for a mad cosmic being as Thanos, anyway none care about it. The old comics are covered with dust and oblivion.I couldn´t stand the Captain America having the power of lightning and masterfully using Mjolnir, like he was expend training all his life with it. Totally sickining. ""He is worthy"" well he just need it to throw it, and wield it, just like that.Hawkeye the forgoten advenger was in a crazy rol, who cares? Where were Adam Warlock and Magus and even more The Living Tribunal?Why name this movies ""Infinity war""? with the excuse of the alternate filmic universe, very powerful plots are crumbling, one after another.Maybe that happens when you expect that new things overcome the old ones, or even that match just a little."
Avengers: Endgame,14-May-19,"Endgame is a much less interesting and visually engaging movie than Infinity War. I don't understand all the crazy hype and 8.8 on imdb is stupid, this is why I'm giving it one star, to mitigate the stupidity.As everyone expected, remaining avengers use time travel to try to fix things, yet even for a marvel movie the time travel science is confusing and ridiculous, as well as shown in a very boring way. I've seen low budget movies that had better grasp on the scientific, logical and visual aspect of time travel.The whole point of endgame is to resurrect the fallen avengers and other trillions of creatures across the galaxy, yet while doing it avengers end up losing irrevocably even more important members of the team, and the whole thing looks ill-conceived.A lot of time is spent on meaningless conversations, while the devastation Thanos caused across the galaxy is barely shown, negating the past and current sacrifices of avengers.I left Infinity War wanting to see how the story ends.
I left Endgame feeling that I should've waited for it to come out on Netflix."
Avengers: Endgame,28-May-19,"What they did to Hulk and Thor was disgusting. The best action Hulk had was handing tacos to Antman. They turned him into taco Tuesday Hulk with no redemption or rematch for Thanos.Fat alcoholic self pity Thor was not funny and for a demi god he turned out to be league bowler from crap town Ohio. Appalling and gross! Oh, support group Cap was another miss. They turned the women into men and the men into women straight up Hollywood style. 👎👎"
Avengers: Endgame,12-Aug-19,The worst of all the avengers sequence. Boring apart from some cool action scenes. Stupid scene when CA lifts thor's hammer wtf. Also we were expecting Dr Strange to show his real powers and see him more in the movie as he is the most powerful
Avengers: Endgame,30-Jul-19,"It was normal movie but captain marvel ruined it. She was, very overpowered and she was strongest character. Adding her in this movie was very big mistake plot was coll tho but it wqs ruined by capitan marvel"
Avengers: Endgame,03-Jun-19,"I want to start out saying I love all the Marvel movies leading up to Endgame. I loved Infinity War because it seemed to be setting up a terrific conclusion to the original 6 Avengers story arc's. I was very wrong. Let's start with Tony's Arc. In Ironman 1 Tony is told you are a man who has everything and nothing. In Ironman 2 we find out his dad was distant and cold to him, and in ironman 3 he is getting panic attacks because he thinks it's up to him to save the world from all threats. So in Endgame he finally gets everything that's important. He becomes a Dad and husband and... was proven right by having to die saving the universe himself? Why? Because we are supposed to believe Tony can't retire? Of course he can. Didn't he say to Steve in AoU ""isn't that why we fight so we can end the fight? So we can go home?"" Tony wanted to retire. Tony's arc should have been about being a good dad like his father never was and finally becoming the man who has everything important. He should have learned that he doesn't have to do it all on his own. Team work should have won the final battle. What's the point of finally getting all the Avengers together if it's left to one man to sacrifice himself to save everyone? Tony's ending was not satisfying and it was not the end they have been building towards from the beginning. Now let's talk about the real tragedy in this movie. Steve Rogers character. We know he is a good man who always does what he believes is right. He calls Home the Avengers facility and says he can't ignore a situation that's headed south. He loved Peggy but found out she had gotten married and had a happy life and he tried moving on with her niece. This storyline was ignored which was ok because most of Steves storyline in the MCU has been about saving Bucky. You remember him right? Steve didn't seem to for the entire movie. Instead of thinking about Sam and Bucky and all the people they are going to save if their plan works when they find Thanos in the beginning of Endgame Steve's just looking at the Peggy compass that he hasn't looked at in at least 3 movies. Why? So we can all forget about his actual character development and think it's a great ending when he goes back in time to be with Peggy. I'm just going to ignore all the plot holes associated with Steve going back in time and just focus on the character assasination this commits. This means the same guy who says he can't ignore a situation headed south, who never ran away from a fight, who said I'm with you till the end of the line"" to Bucky is just going to live out his life in the past never saving his friend from being a brain washed assassin, never saving his other friends parents from being killed by his best friend, never stopping any of the thousands of bad things he would know are going to happen? That's not Steve. The writers never let Steve get a personal life. He never found someone after Peggy and he never had anything except the Avengers. He was the one that was set up to die. The final battle starts with what is probably the most epic scene in comic book movie history but fizzles our soon after. Doctor Stranges plan makes no sense. How was this the only way they could win? Why couldn't Captain Marvel snap? Why couldn't captain Marvel just fly the gauntlet to another galaxy? Why couldn't Doctor Strange open a portal and drop the gauntlet on some random planet? In Infinity War why didn't Doctor Strange use his portal to go to Wakanda and tell Thor to aim for the head. The characters powers were very inconsistent for the first time in the MCU. Why was Thanos with no infinity stones able to fight Mjolnir and Storm Breaker but Thanos with all 6 stones would have lost to Storm Breaker if Thor would have just aimed for the head? Why can Captain Marvel fly through a huge spaceship 10 times but she gets knocked out after one punch from Thanos? Why does no one attack Thanos at the same time as someone else? Where's the big team up? You would think getting everyone together for the first time would have been the only way to defeat Thanos, but you'd be wrong because it's all about Tony stark. Even Steve picking up Mjolnir means nothing really because it has no affect on the end of the battle. Thor and Steve could be taken out of this movie and nothing would change. They do nothing of importance. This movie seems so disconnected from Infinity War that it's boggles my mind how this movie has the same writers and directors as Infinity War and it was filmed at the same time as Infinity War. How can you get one so wrong and the other so right? It seems clear to me that the writers and directors decided that Tony was dying and Steve was going back to the past no matter how much their story suffered from doing it. It's like they had a check list of things to put in the movie without actually making a good story that fit in with the rest of their movies. This is by far the most dissapointing ending to anything I've ever looked forward to."
Avengers: Endgame,20-May-19,"Too bad there isn't a zero star rating. I am not the target demo, was dragged to the movie theater by my young son to see it (he thought the movie was OK. I didn't.1. Lots of nothing much happens
2. Lots of melodramatic music
3. The movie at 182 minutes is about 82 minutes too long
4. The Thor character ceases to become comic amusement about a third through the pic
5. Incomprehensible and repeated fight scenes
6. Exceptionally poor dialog in the screenplayVisually the only star turns were Brie Larson and Elizabeth Olsen. The Scarlet Witch, one of the stronger themes was barely in this - Olsen should get her own movie.I was three hours of my life back plus $68 bucks spent on tickets and popcorn at AMC."

Avengers: Endgame,21-Jun-19,"This is a movie where one term could be used to describe it, and that term is ""tedium."" I've always had a begrudging attitude towards Avengers movies because, as with a lot of entries in the MCU, it's a lot of scientific nonsense with the action thrown in as an afterthought in order to justify its existence as a superhero movie. But I thought I would give Endgame a fair chance. After all, having all those superheroes on one screen should be fun, action packed, and entertaining, right? Wrong.I cannot express how terrible this film was. The two redeemable parts were Tony Stark's daughter and Ant-Man. They were the only entertaining parts of the film. I pay money to see movies that are entertaining, not ones that are so full of characters that you get lost.There are a lot of reasons that I hated this movie, but I'm going to focus on two in particular here: the story and the action, or rather, the lack of action. First, the story. This entire film was built around a needlessly complicated plot surrounding time travel, even though the time travel was completely pointless in the first place. Bruce Banner says, point blank, that traveling back into the past won't change the future. So, why do you do it, then? Why on Earth would you commit to such an exercise in complete futility? I'll tell you why, because you need more science fodder for all the Marvel super fans, so that they can leave the theater and point at someone who looks confused and feel superior.Everything was poorly written in this movie. When your forced obscenities are being spouted from the mouths of the people you're supposed to cheer for, while your villain speaks in Shakespearean soliloquies, then you've clearly gone completely wrong with your script. Also, the part where Stark's daughter swears and we were supposed to find it cute? Yeah, I didn't. I found it grossly inappropriate and wrong to show a 4 or 5 year old child in such a manner. It wasn't innocent and sweet, it was rather demented. Meanwhile, Thanos speaks in these long, grandiloquent speeches that never seem to have an end. It was all just one big pile of dreck.Thanos was another problem I had with this film. His motivations were never properly spelled out. They tried, but they failed rather miserably. It seemed like he just wanted to destroy the world because it was ripe for the taking, I guess? I don't know. He was weird as well, because he said he was going to build another universe, but he seemed to have a nihilistic outlook on everything, so that would mean his other universe would be completely pointless. Anyway, it was really terrible.But this movie's main sin was its lack of action through the first two-thirds, and the fact that it hardly showed the Avengers doing anything heroic. They never stopped a bank robbery, they never helped an assault victim, all they did was do their pointless time travel stuff to attempt to stop Thanos, even though Bruce said it would be completely futile to do so. The movie couldn't get out of its own way and it suffered because of it.Then the last third was all action and it blew my mind, but not in a good way. I left the theater with a physical headache due to the poor pacing and cinematography on the final battle sequences. They were overly long, started and stopped way too many times, and attempted to tie up every loose end from the entire MCU in one big bang. It was just terrible! You have to allow things to flow, and this movie didn't flow at all.A movie that was boring, poorly paced, poorly written, and just a terrible excuse for film definitely deserves a spot on my worst of 2019 list. Hopefully, Toy Story 4 makes up for it!"

Avengers: Endgame,29-Jun-19,"Cheap dialogs, non sense violence. The only thing the movie has to offer is explosions. Is it really that hard to make quality superhero movies?

Avengers: Endgame,20-May-19,"The last Avengers ended with a philosophically valid dilemma. Stop the overpopulation of all worlds by halving the population in the universe in order to save humans and other species. The only mention of environment in Endgame was Captain America stating ""a pod of whales was seen in the Hudson, if you want to look at the bright side"" to which Black Widow replies ""I will throw this sandwich at you"". Yup, that's as deep as that conversation went. Immediately they were back to the tired old 'save humanity from evil Thanos' plot. The world is portrayed as a complete shambles with Thanos' reduced population measures. It would have been far more interesting to show the positive changes of having fewer people in the richness of the planet, thriving of other species as well as our own. But no, that is completely ignored and the ecosystem crushing population returns. Very generic plot, disappointing."
Parasite,18-Oct-19,"It's not really a review but my attempt to explain how I interpreted the movie to those who complain that the film is overrated, especially if the reason is that they didn't like the second half of it.It's much easier to understand the message of a movie when the 'good guys' win or the 'bad guys' get punished in the end. I'm not saying that all Hollywood films are so naive in their portrayal of moral values. But still, I believe that Parasite is much more subtle than most other movies that people are accustomed to watching in which there's a character with a clearer 'moral center' whom audiences can easily relate to. So, I think it's no surprise if the message of this film had failed to register for some of the audiences.Some complained that they don't understand Ki-Taek's motive for killing Mr. Park. But to fully appreciate this, you need to understand the meaning of a recurring expression in the dialogue which is, ""crossing the line"".It's a deliberately ambiguous phrase that can either read as one should respect other people's privacy or as one should mind one's own (social) position instead of meddling with the affairs of those in a different position. If interpreted as the latter meaning, it can serve as another image that emphasizes the subject matter of the narrative, along with more easy to notice the metaphor of the two families' respective dwellings.It would probably have satisfied such audiences who expected more lighthearted drama if the movie focused on an underprivileged, but more likable family exploiting a cold hearted snobbish family in a comical manner. But the movie would have lost all its genuine charms if Bong Joon-Ho chose such a path, and he is too good a director not to see such a danger.Instead, he chose to make Mr. Park a reasonable enough character, despite his occasional hints that reveal his true nature. He seems to treat Ki-Taek fairly enough at first, but he also warns the latter not to 'cross the line' if Ki-Taek attempts to pry into his private life.At first, it seems that it's quite easy for Ki-Taek and other members of his family to sneak into Mr. Park's house in various roles and mingle with them. Ki-Taek even compliments how nice Mr. Park's family is, but his premature admiration soon gets challenged when he overheard, when he was hiding under the table, what Mr. Park really thinks of him - almost a different species of the human being who doesn't even smell like him.Ki-Taek's final disillusionment came when Mr. Park cringes from the smell of the dead basement dweller and shows much more concern for his son's shock while virtually ignoring Ki-Taek's daughter's status who's dying on the ground, spurting blood from the stab wound.That moment, Ki-Taek realizes how Mr. Park sees him and his whole family as not an equal human being, but something much more insignificant.And he also realizes the 'line' that separates the two families is not just that of courtesy or proper social behaviour. Instead, it is a line that can even determine the life of those 'lesser' human beings to be less important than the passing unpleasant feelings or mental shock of those 'proper' human beings.However easy it was for Ki-Taek's family to sneak into Mr. Park's house, or however they try to socialize and mingle with Mr. Park's family, their existence is no better than that of a 'parasite', which is also visualized so effectively by the presence of the hidden basement room inside the house.With such disillusionment and anger, Ki-Taek chose to kill Mr. Park, as a parasite could to its host, and like a parasite, he keeps hiding deep inside the dead host's body until he could claim the whole of the carcass and use it as nourishment for his offsprings.The tragedy was not something caused by any exceptional defect or vice of either Mr. Park's or Ki-Taek's personalities. Instead, it's a 'line' drawn by an invisible hand, separating those classes according to their respective social conditions, which can be so brutal as to be able to deprive the two families of their humanity in contrasting manners. And that is what I believe to be the message this film is trying to convey.Of course, not every movie must make a commentary on society rather than providing a care-free pastime that everyone can understand.But without if the movie didn't change its gear in the second half to shed light on a serious inherent problem of our society, it would be just another heist gone wrong type comedy, instead of a deserving candidate to be called the best film of the year."
Parasite,05-Jul-19,"I am remarkably stingy with my 10/10 ratings. I'll be the first person to acknowledge this. Of the roughly 2600 titles I've rated on here, only 34 have a 10.
Parasite is one of them. If this isn't a masterpiece, then I don't know what is.I'm going to keep it vague on the plot-front, because I didn't know anything about it going in, and was really excited to see it progress and unfold in satisfying, unexpected ways.What I will say is that this film, more than just about any other I've seen, put me through so many different emotional states during its 132-minute runtime, and did so without ever feeling muddled or tonally inconsistent. Parts of this movie were hilarious. Parts were heartbreaking. Other parts were insanely suspenseful (I'm honestly not sure if I've felt this close to the edge of my seat since the final season of Breaking Bad, way back in 2013).And it does all this while being perfectly paced, beautifully directed, and amazingly acted from every single member of its cast. All the characters are understandable and sympathetic to some degree; the amount of conflict, drama and tension derived from a narrative with no clear heroes and villains is staggering. You come to care for just about all of them.I'm stumped to come up with any flaws for this movie. And sure, I've seen many movies that are hard to fault, but it's rare that a movie appeals to me on a gut level and excites me to this degree while also being so close to technically perfect. It's extremely entertaining, thoroughly moving in so many different ways, and as icing on the cake there's a ton of social commentary and some heavy themes to chew on once the movie's over (and this one's not going to leave my head for a while, I can tell).Catch this one when you can and believe the hype. Joon-Ho Bong has made many great films (and so far no bad one's), but this even manages to stand head and shoulders above all the others.When it comes time to consider what the best film of the 2010s was, this one will surely be up there."
Parasite,06-Oct-19,"I can't remember the last time I saw a movie that contained as many genres as 'Parasite'. The movie starts out almost like an 'Ocean's Eleven' heist film and then expands into a comedy, mystery, thriller, drama, romance, crime and even horror film. It really did have everything and it was strikingly good at all of them too.I love a film that respects its audience. There are so many details in this movie that are crucially important and yet the film trusts its audience to notice them and acknowledge them without ramming them down our throats. There are a lot of layers to this film and I suspect for this reason its rewatch-ability factor will be very high.The film was incredibly entertaining too. I can't think of a boring scene in this movie and yet on the surface for large parts of the film you would say not a lot is happening, at least in terms of action. Fascinating characters and brilliant dialogue are what create this. I had a great time with 'Parasite' and I think most that give it a chance will too."
Parasite,25-Aug-19,"In a meritocracy, success and fortune are reserved for those who deserve it--those who develop solid plans according to their talents and abilities and who execute those plans through hard work and determination. Anyone can rise to the top, and for some lucky Cinderella, plucked from the cinders and gussied up in gowns, the meritocracy represents the heights of perfect egalitarian society: ""I started with nothing and ended up with everything I ever desired; you, too, can achieve you dreams, if only you try.""The promise of unobstructed sunshine at the top of the mountain becomes justification for bitter competition, backstabbing, deceit, and callousness. You climb the crooked ladder until you make it to the straight one, and then, perhaps, when you at last feel secure, you can afford to be kind and confident and generous. ""It's easy to be nice when you're rich,"" the mother in this film (Jang Hye-jin) at one point observes.But it's a very long and very crooked ladder, and sometimes the rungs give out beneath your grip, and sometimes they've been dangerously greased by those who climbed before you, and sometimes the ladder itself is simply kicked down--either by those above you or, just as often, by those staring up from the ground below. There are a lot of people trying to climb that one ladder.But in a meritocracy, you can't blame the ladder or the other people trying to climb it. Nor can you blame the fact that all the good stuff is kept so many stories up instead of down at the ground where everyone can easily reach it. No, you must blame yourself. You should have tread more carefully. You should have climbed more quickly. You should have used a firmer and more precise grip, anticipated disasters, and known just when to leap. If you fail in a meritocracy, it's all your fault. You should have tried harder. Better luck next time.Kim Ki-woo (Choi Woo-sik), the young man who is the main character of PARASITE, several times refers to ""metaphors,"" and the film itself is, of course, a metaphor. On a surface level, viewers are treated to a very thrilling, engaging, well-paced and well-plotted crime story. At all times, however, bubbling up from beneath the slick surface of this genre film, there are deeply personal, meaningful truths that should resonate with almost any viewer. These insights are rarely foregrounded. They are so subtly interwoven, in fact, that if you're like me, you may be completely surprised when the final shots of the film roll and you realize that you are emotionally devastated by the intimate, humanist story you've just witnessed. Bong Joon-ho's filmmaking is so extraordinary here that he'll make you fully invested in the lives of his characters without you even realizing he's done so.I want to avoid spoilers here, but suffice it to say that PARASITE is a masterpiece--beautifully lensed, enthrallingly edited, superbly acted, and intimately involving.South Korea has a population that is one sixth the size of the United States, and that population is stacked into skyscrapers in an area slightly smaller than the state of Kentucky. Higher education is widespread, so parents with means try to make their children stand above the pack by hiring them tutors and signing them up for extracurriculars and afterschool programs. I lived in Korea once, and the children I taught there were sometimes engaged in learning ten to twelve hours a day, six days a week--public school, English-immersion private school, piano class, soccer team, taekwondo, math camp, chess club, and so on. I routinely worked sixty to seventy hours a week on salary, but at bars I would meet young men my age who were expected to work far more than that, who slept at their desks so that they did not need to pry themselves from work for too long. As the father (Song Kang-ho) in the film at one point says, this is a country where fifty young men with college degrees apply for a mere security guard job. One can't afford not to struggle.The themes of this story are not just localized to Korea, however. They are the story of global capitalism, and the specter of American materialism (and imperialism; note the ""Indians"") looms heavily over the film. Meritocracy makes cannibals of us all. It's nice to dream, and sometimes the dreamers who plan and struggle well enough can indeed climb out of the basement and into the sunshine, and how nice an ending it is when they do. But the film also makes it clear that sometimes all that planning and dreaming may be, maybe, just whims and fancy. More often, it seems, our pipe dreams are content to leave us with nothing more than the whiff of spewed sewage."
Parasite,28-Dec-19,"Parasite was directed and written by Bong Joon Ho and tells the story of the Kim family and their life-changing involvement with the Park family.Parasite can best be described as astonishing, astounding, stunning or any other synonym of amazing. It is so far my favourite film of the year and one of my favourite films of the decade. The very idea of the plot is simple but incredibly hard to execute and that's, why it's editing, is pitch-perfect and leads to an unexpectedly shocking and brutal ending.The biggest forte of Parasite is the screenplay as it impeccably mixes comedy, drama and horror featuring flawless pacing, breath-taking cinematography, a beautiful score and a brilliant cast making it a masterpiece. Parasite also perfectly presents the subject of classism, showing us how both the working class and the upper class view each other and the people around them. Themes of capitalism can also be felt throughout the film, but Parasite shouldn't be mistaken as a pro-capitalism film as it doesn't support or hate anyone or any side; it's ambiguity also contributes to this factor.Taking everything into account, Parasite is a true work of art and a rare and extraordinary masterpiece that should be viewed by everyone at some point in their lives, especially film lovers.Final Rating - 10/10"
Parasite,19-Aug-19,"This movie is a gosh darn masterpiece. It will make you belly laugh, it will chill you to the bone, and it will make you shed a tear. This movie will stay with you long after the credits are over.If you plan on watching this movie, AVOID SPOILERS AT ALL COSTS."
Parasite,04-Feb-20,The most original film of 2019 and it is wickedly funny and darkly disturbing all at the same time. The narrative and the actors were excellent. One of the better endings of a movie in quite a while. Class warfare at its best.
Parasite,09-Feb-20,Most of the time when my opinion does not jibe with the majority I am confident in my assessment. With this one I am not so sure for some reason. That being said I think it is ridiculously overrated. I just really did not find it to be anything special. I thought the Japanese movie shoplifters was infinitely better.
Parasite,01-Mar-20,"I came to this movie with an open mind, despite the hoo ha around it. Stylistically yep, I can see the hoo haa. The same goes for the acting, once again exceptional . The humour was also done really well. It's just that past the halfway mark it becomes a bit 'meh'. Kind of similar in a way to the film 'us', once it did it's core 'reveal'. It's good that western audiences will watch it and hopefully realise there is a film industry outside of the west..but this film just an ok for me"
Parasite,19-Aug-19,Well written and performed also technically shines cinematography & bgm are too good and there's not even a single lag it's perfectly edited. Probably the best experience in recent times. Its pure art resembles the modern society the emotions they had shelved are insanely exceptional a layered masterpiece. If you like dark thrillers then you shouldn't miss Mr. Bong joon-ho's Parasite. Definitely tops the list of best movies in 2019.
Parasite,04-Jan-20,"Here's how i rate a movie the fast way, i ask myself two questions.
Who am I gonna recommend this movie to ?
Am i gonna remember this movie a year from now ?Beside the somewhat chaotically random events happening in the movie, Parasite wants to be way too many things at the same time, a deep serious movie with a message, a comedy, a drama, and a thriller, the mixture left me feeling confused and not really sure what to feel once it ended.It wasn't too bad, some scenes were super intense and enjoyable for thriller lovers. But I don't see myself recommending it to anyone who wants all these genres crammed in a single movie, nor do I feel anything from the story was amazing enough to stick with me in the future."
Parasite,12-Jan-20,This is a well written and well perfomed original film. With a lot of repetitive cinema these day i felt this was something new. I felt connected and engaged with the character throughout the film. There are several well directed tense moments throughout the film. A popular topic of class struggled well portrayed. Its always nice to see foreign language films having worldwide success.
Parasite,29-Mar-20,"I find it somewhat odd that some people have interpreted this film as anticapitalist. It shines a very narrow light on poverty but it is all conveyed in a very surreal scenario which makes it quite difficult to emotionally engage with the situations that transpire. However, that's not the only reason.The main characters are not particularly likeable, which I'm sure defenders of the film would describe them as morally grey, given the prevailing cultural obsession with the moral ambiguity.It's this morally ambiguous narrative that intends to blur the line of what is good and bad. Nevertheless, this blurring as well as the general surrealness didn't compel me to emotionally engage with the film's story as much as I would've liked. As a result, I found that it really lacks something. It feels like it has rattled out of someone's head, unedited."
Parasite,18-Feb-20,"I'm sorry but I must be living on another planet - I can't understand why this film won an oscar and why some are rating it a 10.
I felt a little bored in parts and I felt uncomfortable. Reading some other reviews after the film, maybe there were some aspects I hadn't analysed and worked out intellectually. But then still I felt it was totally over hyped."
Parasite,05-Nov-19,"Do you want to see a movie that will have your stomach in knots, anxious during many scenes? Do you want to see a movie that will have you conflicted on who you're rooting for? Regardless of your answers, see Parasite.
Parasite ticks along quietly until it is booming in your ears. The symbolism varies. Sometimes it is obvious, Bong Joon-ho might as well have made the subtitles spell it out. But other times it is more subtle, and you might realize a connection or symbolism days or weeks after. Bong Joon-ho is a master at that.
The conversation that it sparks is worth the $13-20 it costs to see the film. Parasite has made me think more than most films I've seen. Give it a watch, see it with friends or family and the dinner table will have a conversation overflowing with opinions and realizations."
Parasite,02-Jul-19,"As a film about a family imposing on another, and keeping dark secrets hidden beneath the surface, Parasite achieves what Jordan Peele set out to do with Us: tell a multi-layered story in a widely entertaining manner, but without sacrificing the believability of its central narrative.That's not to say that Us is an ineffective film by any means, but when it comes to crafting weighty social commentaries under the guise of lighter fare, writer-director Bong Joon-ho is in a class of his own.The film follows a lower-class South Korean family as they slowly integrate themselves in the lives of an upper-class family and their lavish household. As their entanglement is spun out of a web of deceit, the lowly family find themselves skating on thin ice when it comes to keeping up appearances.It's a twisty satire on social-economic disparities in South Korean society that swings broadly in tone, and sometimes threatens to tip over the edge, but never feels less than meticulously calculated in its tonal shifts.However, to reveal anything more about the story would be to take away from the overall experience, as each act is marked by a major plot twist or revelation that keeps the film one step ahead of the viewer at all times. Go in blind if you can and expect an unforgettable ride."
Parasite,26-May-19,"Parasite (Gisaengchung), the 2019 film by Bong Joon-ho, taps into the tensions caused by the widening gap between rich and poor around the world.The film, delivering a strong social commentary that can be interpreted at a universal level, follows two families on opposite sides of the social and financial totem pole. It is a darkly entertaining and suspenseful look at a poor but incredibly cunning family living in a filthy basement and the rich Park family, the polar opposites of our protagonists. The film makes you play a guessing game of which of the two families are the most rotten.Winner of the Palme d'Or at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival, Parasite shows the extent to which we go to in order to live a comfortable life. The devil is in the detail in this grotesque critique of social inequality and the psychology of money."
Parasite,28-Mar-20,"Just won Oscars cz concept was new, but this itself doesn't make it a better movie than Joker. Over hyped, Mediocre and people reviewing it in mob mentality. Nothing against Korean movies."
Parasite,27-Feb-20,"There are a few suspenseful scenes and a decent plot, along with comedic dialogue, but that's it. It's not a ""metaphorical masterpiece"" that some critics and users are saying. I feel as though too many people are trying to be expert critics like on that episode of South Park where the entire town writes crazy yelp reviews for all the restaurants."
Parasite,07-Jan-20,"The film is ok but that's as far as I go. It's worth a watch but only a score of 6 for me. It's not a masterpiece, it's not film of the decade it's not even film of the year. I don't understand how people can give it 10, 10 is a perfect score. 10 is unachievable in my opinion as nothing is perfect."
Parasite,15-Oct-19,"South Korean director Bong Joon-ho (""Okja"") says that he always tries to overturn viewer expectations and hopes that his latest film succeeds in this way. Palme d'Or winner at the 2019 Cannes Film festival, Bong's Parasite (Gisaengchung) does indeed thwart expectations, but the question is - to what end? Defying any strict genre classification, the film is a conglomeration of comedy, drama, satire, crime, horror, and anything else you can throw into the mix. Bong sees the film as a statement about the ""ranks and classes"" inherent in capitalism that are invisible to the eye, and says that the film ""depicts the inevitable cracks that appear when two classes brush up against each other in today's increasingly polarized society."" Unfortunately, the characterizations are filled with so many stereotypes that the lack of any realistic human dimension leaves Bong's statement without much impact.The film looks at class differences between two families - one well-to-do, and the other n'eer do well. For the Kim family, life is a struggle. They live in a cramped bug-infested basement apartment without many amenities except for a toilet built on kind of a shelf. The father Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho, ""Snowpiercer"") has failed in business and has accumulated many debts. His son and daughter Ki-woo (Choi Woo-sik, ""Train to Busan"") and Ki-jung (Park So-dam, ""Cinderella and Four Knights"" TV series) have repeatedly failed college entrance exams. The mother Chung-sook (Hyae-jin Jang, ""Adulthood"") along with the two children fold boxes for a delivery company, but cannot even get that right. Not to worry, they leave their windows open when the fumigators come around to get some free extermination and steal free Wi-Fi from the next door coffee shop.On the other hand, the nouveau riche Park family has all the advantages. Mr. Park (Lee Sun-kyun, ""Jo Pil-ho: The Dawning Rage"") is the CEO of a high-tech company and the family lives in a spacious, modernistic home protected by sturdy concrete walls. He has an attractive somewhat fragile wife Yeon-kyo (Jo Yeo-jeong, ""The Target""), a teenage daughter Da-hye (Jung Ji-so, ""The Tiger""), and a hyper-active young son Da-song (Jung Hyun-jun). Being wealthy and somewhat elitist in their attitude, for Bong, they are ideally suited to be torn apart by ruthless grifters. With the aid of a friend, Ki-woo is hired to be a private tutor for Da-hye. Of course, he has to forge university documents to convince the trusting Mrs. Park of his competence. With that conquest out of the way, the cunning Ki-woo concocts a scheme to secure jobs in the Park household for his entire family.Convinced that their young son is a budding Picasso, Mrs. Park hires Ki-jung as an art teacher, then falls for invented stories impugning the character of their driver and housekeeper to provide some more employment opportunities for the Kims, this time for the deadbeat dad Ki-taek and his wife Chung-sook. Bong said that ""Sometimes with the characters in my films, I look at them cynically, but most of the time I have a lot of compassion for the characters, even with the villains."" This compassion, however, does not seem to extend to the loyal, hardworking household workers, their work scammed out of existence. Without going into detail, the whole escapade backfires in a twist that is over-the-top unsettling even though utterly implausible.Worthy of a Mack Sennett comedy, a sweet family drama turns into a tumultuous melange of hidden chambers, revenge, bloody violence, a torrential rainstorm, people hiding under beds, and any other mayhem that may come to mind. To be clear, Parasite can be very funny and some of the satire is sharp-edged, yet it is hardly, as one critic described it, ""a masterful dissection of social inequality."" When asked what he wanted viewers to get out of the film, Bong said, ""I just hope that it gives audiences a lot to think about. It is in parts funny, frightening, and sad, and if it makes viewers feel like sharing a drink and talking over all the ideas they had while watching it, I'll wish for nothing more."" Enjoy the drink. In a little while, you may have trouble remembering what the film was about."
Parasite,04-Nov-19,"This movie is so masterfully written and presented with a large cast that older audiences will realize how rare movies like this have become. Its enjoyment comes from getting to know the members of two extremely different families, one very poor, the other very rich. How their lives come together is the wickedly enjoyable first half; then, in the second half the house of cards begins to shake and finally collapse with a fury we both dread - and perhaps even enjoy. Though our enjoyment probably has as much to do with the movie-making skills than with the nasty turn of events in the violent final scenes.
If you see only one foreign language film this year, this should be it. Exciting and provocative throughout, it is wonderfully acted and packed with significance for all who live in a polarized society where so many live in luxury, while others live in comparative squalor just a few blocks away. Deserves all the accolades it has already - and surely will continue - to receive."
Parasite,15-Mar-20,I watched this movie. it's a good movie but i couldn't understand how it won the best picture. i think this movie doesn't deserve that for sure.
Parasite,17-Aug-19,"What an amazing film! Clearly an essay on the class divide. Writing lovable but nasty people is tough, but perfectly executed here.They quite clearly cross the line, and when I mean ""they"" I mean bother the working class and the upper class.
You could easily argue that ""parasite"" refers to one family trying to suck another family dry. Or that the upper class is draining the labour of the lower class, and expecting them to be grateful about it too!
There is also something about the American Indian theme, a metaphor for dying cultural traditions which are being replaced by modernity? Nature is dog eat dog? Or is it a homage to an ""idyllic"" past where Native American culture was relatively classless?Either way a must watch if you can handle subtitles!"
Parasite,28-Dec-19,"There is no shortage of films that depict the injustice of social inequality but originality is scarce. With a large proportion of its population below the poverty line, it is noteworthy that a filmmaker from South Korea has produced a work that has attracted almost universal acclaim. Parasite (2019)generates a great deal of conversation but be warned: it is not a film for everyone, especially those averse to gory endings.If you step back from the story's twists and turns, the narrative premise is simple. A family of petty crooks living in abject poverty get lucky as, one by one, each tricks their way into being employed by the same heartlessly wealthy family in roles like tutor, driver, and housekeeper. The gullible family is easy to deceive, while the crooks manufacture various scenarios to their own advantage. The occupation of the luxurious home by the crooks adds a new meaning to the concept of home invasion. However, the plan comes un-stuck when they find a secret dungeon that leads to horrific consequences.The film takes too much time in developing the central premise and various sub-plots, and more descriptive prose could be offered here about what actually happens. But that is not the point of the film. Director Joon-ho Bong paints an intricate portrait of the normalisation of poverty and class privilege, with both sets of family never questioning their place in South Korea's social order. This acceptance and its destructiveness of the human spirit makes change impossible and condemns Korean society to moral bankruptcy.There is more to this film than political discourse. As a black comedy, it is sprinkled with funny although improbable moments and the filming style expresses the polemic in obvious ways. Juxtaposing the world occupied by a smelly cramped underclass with the opulent world of the rich is low-hanging fruit. One can also find elements of magical fantasy, as it requires an unequivocal suspension of disbelief to accept that a family of losers can so easily dupe a family of high achievers. The acting tends towards wooden, and it is difficult to warm to any particular character. The film's climax offers little other than an ambivalent balance between hope and nihilism, leaving viewers to decide which family are the parasites.For many, the critical pendulum swings towards the 'masterpiece' label. But it is perhaps closer to reality to describe this as an original, engaging, and disturbing tale of endemic class tension, oppression, and helplessness. Although tenuous, the message has universal relevance."
The Kissing Booth,26-Jan-19,"Realistic and uncensored (i.e. non-conformist) teen movies are rare, but this is one. It is something different and as an adult I enjoyed it.Don't judge by 1930s standards. Be open to advancement and a truthful movie made to be fun to watch"
The Kissing Booth,25-Dec-18,"It was cutesy and fun. I know girls like to fantasize and probably watch it as girls-only, but if you have a good relationship in the family it is fun to watch as a family to see what girls dream of and also to have some fun."
The Kissing Booth,01-Dec-18,And I am a grown woman. I do have to admit that I watch teen movies because they are fun. This one was fun and sure the man-boy was a hunk.
The Kissing Booth,31-Dec-18,It is a pure teen movie but even if I am not a teen I had fun watching it. It is in the same league as Mean Girls.
The Kissing Booth,28-Mar-19,"Girl can be a teenage girl and boy can be a teenage boy and like the old teen movies they can have feelings, be imperfect and experiment with love, emotions, sexuality and mostly freedom. It is fun to watch. There is nos ex scene, but isn't sex and sexuality nature?"
The Kissing Booth,02-Feb-19,".... but I could not stop watching. I admit.I mean here comes another girl who of course falls for the muscular hunk. What is with women loving only beefcakes?Oh well, at least he is genuinely interested in her and really cares and checking out her wiles we know why.
A film to watch as a family one evening and forget about."
The Kissing Booth,25-Mar-19,"This movie is extremely cliched, but that is what I would expect from a movie of this nature so I enjoyed it anyway. What I didn't expect was for me to have such a strong hope that young girls and men watch this and learn. The one reason I gave this movie 8 stars is not because acting is pretty good but because it signals that clarity and communication in relationships is important."
The Kissing Booth,19-May-18,"If you want to experience a fifteen year old girls fantasy, this is it!! :)
For that it like it, kind of. 
The acting is even pretty good, given that the writing is clumsy."
The Kissing Booth,22-Apr-19,"The girl is doing her best and performing as well as possible under duress and pressure. Dating is competitive but she is doing her best with all she has. she isn't the sexiest babe, but flaunts just a little to attract a man."
The Kissing Booth,09-Jul-18,"I really hope there aren't any young girls who watch this movie and think:
1. That's how I need to act in order to get a guy
2. That's how a typical high school is for everyone (stereotypes and all)
3. Getting drunk and stripping has only good consequences
4. If a guy gets handsy, there will always be someone to save me
5. Sneaking around and lying about a relationship means that it's true love
6. Bad boy players who ride motorcycles make the perfect boyfriends
7. If I have sex with someone, we'll fall in love.It was a cute movie with okay acting and the main characters had good chemistry, but everything just conveniently kept falling into place and I felt like it was written by a 12 year old girl who fantasizes about what high school and dating is going to be like."
The Kissing Booth,07-Mar-19,This wasfun to watch. The setting is fun and oriented on two teens with the girl getting a lot of attention from her hunk. Many inferior suitors come for the girl but she is rarely dazzled by weak men. A positive message.
The Kissing Booth,17-Feb-19,"Full of lovely scenes and lines and the messages that this movie portrays are uplifting for young girls. A guy ignores you but it's okay because he is popular and then you get to go on a date with him and you win him because that's what you want, the main guy is strong, powerful and an alpha male and borderline sexy... the only slightly disappointing factor was the relationship between the best friends."
The Kissing Booth,01-Jan-19,"Really enjoyed it. Smart girl who has determination. The man is a real Alpha male, modern relationship with a thin hot bod who is worth it, laughs and of course lots of laugh to make it qualify as a comedy. Enjoy"
The Kissing Booth,10-Mar-19,It is a pure teen movie but even if I am not a teen I had fun watching it. It is in the same league as Mean Girls.
The Kissing Booth,28-Jan-19,"SPOILER: Yes, at first glance the movie is just cute and light only. Elle and Noah are a classic girl and best friend's older brother couple, not unusual and not too sappy. But here's the real triumph: Noah is an alpha male and has a lot of love in him - before they're even official. He adores her and expects her to be protected by him. We already know he cares when he tells her not to go to parties, takes ownership and gets into fights over her. So romantic! There is one scene in particular where he fights someone over Elle's honor and then he is visibly upset. This is a good relationship for young girls and good to feel wanted and loved. How many men care enough like he does? We should carefully consider how our current media affects young minds in the formative stages where every film has too-cool-to-be-in-love-kids. Not here. I want more kisses!! number two please."
The Kissing Booth,11-May-19,This is not a old people's movie. The adventure is quite innocent. What this is a coming of age movie that has both nostalgia and strong gender roles. One can be beautiful and strong at the same time. One can be a girl at school and in love at the same time. One should not be ashamed of the human body and so on. Good film.
The Kissing Booth,07-Apr-19,"I can't say that i did not enjoy this film. It was fineand it is difficult not to fall for Joey Kings manliness. Yet the movie sent some strange signals because he is fighting for a butterface. Yes, she is thin and has feminine hair. It shows the second a girl shows skin she gets attention and the boy she wants, which is all true, natural and good. Also it is obviously one of the oldest cliches in life about a girl falling for the hunk."
The Kissing Booth,03-Feb-19,"It is a great type of message to girls that she should be true to her feelings and also be happy with her body and proud of herself, her body and her own thoughts. Good film to watch with parents so they can deal with reality."
The Kissing Booth,23-Oct-18,"It is a surprisingly complex teen love story , so much so that I couldn't believe that it ended , when it did . maybe a nice divergence from the simple streak of rom-coms . story is fresh-ish , acting nice , well the movie ain't bad"
The Kissing Booth,27-Jan-20,"Think nature, normalcy, Britney Spears video...What type of message does it send to girls when she has to strip several times to gain Noah's attention? One of power and control of course. The female body is powerful and the message is treat your body well and become attractive and you control men.A feminist message."
The Kissing Booth,11-Dec-18,The sequel please!!! a funny movie ... the actors gave everything on the set !!! We all want more about noah and elle ... we need a second one please!
The Kissing Booth,28-May-18,"I'm 28 and went into this movie knowing full well it's aimed at teenagers. I enjoy fluffy teen romance though so have no problem with cheesy storylines and characters, and this film is full of them! What I did have a problem with is the way relationships between women and men are portrayed in this film. It seems to start out ok: the leading teenage girl (Elle) has a male best friend (Lee) and their relationship is pretty cute and I thought it was quite progressive to show a girl and a boy who really are just friends without all the usual sexual tension you get in movies like this. Lee has an older brother (Noah) who is unremarkable except he is very good looking. Things then start to go a bit wrong. It turns out Noah is pretty controlling of Elle, even telling all the other boys at school they can't date her or he'll hurt them. He frequently gets into fights with other boys when he sees them talking to her and beats people up. In one scene he's shouting at Elle to get in his car and even slams his fists down on the car bonnet aggressively whilst telling her, which made me feel really uncomfortable. There's even one scene where Elle has a minor accident and cuts her face, and Lee asks her if Noah hit her! That scene is then never followed up by any explanation - why would Lee immediately assume Noah beat up Elle?!Meanwhile, Lee, who is portrayed as Elle's loveable and affable best friend controls her in his own way, by freaking out when he finds out she's dating Noah, asking her if she's having sex with him (none of his business?) and only accepting her back as a friend when she is no longer seeing Noah, despite her being obviously devastated about breaking up with him. In one scene he insists to her that breaking up with him was the right decision (he didn't really leave her any choice though did he).There are also a couple of weird scenes where Elle strips off to the delight of crowds of boys, once when she was so drunk she had no idea what she was doing and everyone just stood there and allowed her to take her dress off. Another time in the boys locker room. Both scenes were odd and again, made me feel uncomfortable. Other strange elements of the film are Noah being portrayed as a bad boy who gets into fights all the time, yet the reasons for this are not even explored one tiny bit. And even weirder, despite him being a bad boy who is presumably troubled, it's revealed that he's really randomly got a place at Harvard. This was weird because at no point during the film was it suggested that he was academic or even remotely ambitious, yet you don't get into Harvard without trying! There's also a summer montage of Elle and Noah together which is basically them having sex anywhere and everywhere. It felt a little yucky because she's a high school teenager and I thought it was an irresponsible message to send teenage girls out there. A really funny part is when the kissing booth is immortalised at their prom as a memory that touched everybody's lives and Elle's all emotional because she was ""part of something"". REALLY? A kissing booth?! Then, after sitting through all of this, Noah goes off to Harvard at the end of the movie and you're very much left with the impression that's the end of their romance. So I didn't even get the feel-good happy ending I was after. So basically, this movie is really awful and if you have a daughter, I'd actually advise extreme caution allowing young girls to watch this movie because it really does send out the wrong messages about relationships and sex."
The Kissing Booth,14-Apr-20,"But really not enough to be free and coolThis is clearly a good attempt to make a sequel for John Hughes films. They had the right ingredients. Bunch of so-so girls (need to be more naturl and flaunt) and guys, losers fighting back the status quo, a main character who starts from 2, goes to 9, loses everything to go way back to 0 and then goes back to... 9 'cause she shouldn't have it all, it would be too cliché right?"
The Kissing Booth,19-May-18,In all honesty I don't get why people are rating it 1/10 or 2/10. I loved it. Super cute story line about a thin line between friendship or falling in love with her bff's brother. Definitely recommend!
The Kissing Booth,19-May-18,"I saw reviews that said the film was poor,
however personally I thoroughly enjoyed the film and will be watching it again. it's comedic, emotional and sweet all at the same time. the actors have amazing chemistry and the plot is very well planned out and full of twists.
wouldn't recommend for 12 and under however.
amazing film!"
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri",29-May-20,"Is kinda rare to see a female and male character fit so well on screen, Frances McDormand and Sam Rockweel perfomances are amazing, Woody Harrelson is also great, in fact everyone in this film is great, even the characters with short time on screen, that's great writing, direction and acting.McDormand show extremely well the terrible weight and pain that her character is suffering, she is also shows a lot attitude in the things she does and says, the way she walks and looks to someone is like she's going to war.Rockweel also give the best performance of his career so far, he balanced being funny, dumb, racist, violent, weak and strong, he does all that extremely well.Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is a very good film and can become a classic on character development."
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri",04-Dec-17,"""Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri"" marks a milestone for writer/directer Martin McDonagh and is an idea piece on a mother's struggle with her town after posting billboards containing a call to action in regards to her murdered daughter. With outstanding screen writing and near perfect editing, this powerhouse of a film is easily one of the best all year and is driven with force and intensity by its lead, Frances McDormand.What begins as a narrow and focused drama, gradually escalates to a film with big themes and ideas, relevant social commentary, and much more subplots than anticipated. ""Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri"" is packed with questions and a few answers about anger, revenge, violence, and kindness. The story shows people in a realistic light I've never quite seen before. We're presented with characters and their genuine emotions. Nothing feels sugarcoated of fluffed but it never lacks emotional impact either. The movie balances its seemingly contradictory tones beautifully by crafting a dark comedy that feels heavy due to strong subject matter, while at the same time, utilizing comedic moments that feel completely natural to the character's motivations. It's obvious great care was taken into this script and the method in which it's constructed. One of the most talked about elements to this film are the strong performances; particularly by Frances McDormand and Sam Rockwell. Rightfully so, this is some of their best (if not their best) work these eyes have beheld and they steal the show in every film they're in. That's not take away from Woody Harrelson and Lucas Hedges, as well as the entire cast who give memorable performances and paint shockingly believable characters that we feel we know personally. If there is anything that might turn audiences away from this film, it might be its harsh subject matter despite none of it every being depicted as well as its language and execution with the material. Personally, this has a strong impact and I wouldn't have changed anything about it. It's a highly recommended film with a lot to ponder at the end and is definitely a contender for best movie of the year. Definitely don't miss this one."
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri",17-Feb-18,"When you think about great cinema, you often imagine some grandiose epic setting which all that greatness builds upon. The likes of Gone With the Wind or Godfather or The Shawshank Redemption, such films span through decades or cover the major historic events.But a great story isn't necessary grand on the outside. Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is like a tiny rabbit hole size of those three wooden screens, but stick a head in - and you'll see a huge empty space laid with people's sorrow, guilt and regret. And that emptiness sucks you in and leaves no way to stay untouched.But there's also hope. Hope for justice. Hope for retribution. And maybe even hope that it's still not too late to change something, or to change yourself. That nothing is absolutely black and white. That even in the darkest moments of our lives there's some room for a sense of humor, maybe a sad and bitter one but still one worth a warm smile.This world is a crooked place, where crime often goes unpunished. And Peter Dinklage's small role in this film, as a reference to another not so pretty world where the ""happily ever after"" way doesn't quite exist, is a stinging reminder of that. TBOEM does not, however, try to pull the magic sword out of the stone and go crush the wicked and protect the righteous. Instead, it shows that sometimes, crumbling under the weight of the evil things that fall on us, we lose our own limits and become those who sow evil ourselves. Anger does beget even more anger.And maybe the reason that makes America great indeed is that, with all the messed up stuff happening without and within, it's in your culture to value forgiveness, something Christianity teaches everyone but not everyone tends to listen. To suffer without guilt, yet to offer a helping hand to your offender when he's down and wounded. To break the circle of evil and help each other wake that yearning for decency that everyone has inside them, albeit dormant sometimes. Forgiveness is tough, and, just like revenge, it doesn't bring back the things - or people - we've lost. But at least it helps to hold onto what could still be here.Yeah, it's just a movie, and most people aren't as deep and philosophical as the movie characters can afford to be. But if some unrealistic complexity (and sometimes even wisdom) of the simple people could make some real regular people on the other side of the screen stop and think over their own real regular ways, maybe that's exactly what we need from time to time. Because life is still here, and so are the multiple choices it gives, And which road to choose today, we can still decide along the way."
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri",04-Dec-17,"Frances McDormand is, without question, one of the very best actresses of hers or any generation. Wow! And like most of the greatest she goes for characters who don't ask for sympathy. The truth is in her eyes, always. So, naturally, I followed her every inch of the way. She is surrounded by a fantastic group of actors. Woody Harrelson is just extraordinary but perhaps the biggest surprise is Sam Rockwell making his one eighty not just believable but very moving. Martin McDonagh's writing is the magic potion that keeps everything together and when I say everything I mean everything. Humor and horror as if it were practically the same thing. The dialogue is brilliant and Frances McDorman deserves the last paragraph. Her face is a wonder. Superb performance. Don't miss it."
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri",30-Oct-17,"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is a dark comedy that has an a-list cast with names like Frances McDormand, Woody Harrelson, Sam Rockwell, John Hawkes, and Peter Dinklage. It centers around Mildred Hayes, a woman whose daughter was raped and killed, and who believes that the local police have not done enough about it. In reaction, she erects three billboards outside of her town that send a message to the sheriff about the state of the investigation.Writer/director Martin McDonagh (Seven Psychopaths, In Bruges) has outdone himself with this one. In my opinion, if this isn't one of the top Oscar contenders come awards season, then Hollywood has officially lost its mind.Basically everything about this film works: from the acting, to the writing, to the direction. Mcdormand gives the performance of her career here, giving us humor through all the pain clearly shown on her face. Rockwell also gives his best performance here as a cop who isn't that bright and is more than a little racist. Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is probably the most unpredictable film of the year, and that's coming from a year that includes films like Baby Driver and Logan. There are scenes where you think that you know where the plot is going, but then midway through it completely flips the script. For the entire run-time of this film, I was invested. It has the perfect run-time; it ends exactly when it needs to and there is not a scene that feels out of place. It seems like one of the hardest things to do in film nowadays is to balance comedy and drama. However, this movie does it effortlessly. Each scene has just the right amount of comedy and drama, and sometimes, despite the fact that you're laughing, it's easy to forget that jokes are being made.Also, the message that this film gives off resonates very powerfully with you after the film finishes. It makes you see the good side in humanity, despite our flaws. No character in this film is a cliché one-dimensional shell of a person. Everybody has a reason for being there, which is more than some films recently have offered.Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is easily one of the best and most enjoyable films of 2017, and it will make you laugh, cry, and think all in one sitting. There are not any clear flaws with this film that I can find, but I am still searching.I give Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri an A+."
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri",18-Sep-17,"Having recently won the People's Choice Awards at TIFF, Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri is very easy to see why it won.Three Billboards is a dark but also funny and heart-felt story about one woman's quest to get justice for her daughter's rape and murder. After Mildred Haynes buys three billboards with words written on them accusing the town's well-liked sheriff of having not found her daughter's killer, it sets a series of events that turns the citizens and the cops against her.The thing I can say about Three Billboards without going into spoilers is that it is wildly unpredictable. One moment you think things are going one direction as expected then it takes hard left turn that only adds to the dynamic between the characters. As the pressure within the town builds and anger is pointed towards Mildred, we see many of these characters evolve in order to deal with tragedy and grief and learn to find peace. And the movie goes through a roller-coaster of emotions. One moment you are laughing your butt off from the hilarious dialogue then you feel like someone just punched you in the gut. With every victory you think this story brings you feel like it was taken away from because of the world's unfairness and injustice. In lesser hands the mixture of dark and comedic tones would not work, but director and writer Martin McDonagh knows how to balance them to perfection.The performances here just through the roof. Frances McDormand delivers a performance that will for sure get her into the Lead Actress awards race at the Oscars. As Mildred, McDormand just cuts loose with her performance with every line of hate, cynicism and cursing towards everyone she feels doesn't truly understand the internal pain she is going through. But McDormand does now and then show a soft side to Mildred. It shows that Mildred is just person like everyone who has her own way of dealing with the tragedy of loosing her own child. And Sam Rockwell also gives one of the best performances of his career as the flawed and very misguided cop Dixon. The character of Dixon is short-tempered, volatile, and not bright with some baggage of his own that the locals accuse him of. But Sam Rockwell brings his charm and sincerity to what could be a rather unlikable character. And in the latter half, you see Dixon go through a tremendous arc of learning to care about others rather then just being angry towards them. Other great performances that should be called out are Woody Harrelson, Peter Dinklage, John Hawk and Caleb Landry Jones.Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri is easily one of the best movies this year and is worth seeing once it comes out in wide releases."
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri",07-Dec-17,"Frances McDormand is a grieving mother who puts up ""Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, Missouri"" in this 2017 black comedy directed by Martin McDonagh.Mildred Hayes (McDormand) is disgusted that the police haven't found her daughter's rapist and killer, so she takes out billboards asking why the chief of police, Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) hasn't done anything about the case.The billboards set off anger, violence, and revenge motifs in this small town. Things become worse when a pent-up police officer, Dixon (Sam Rockwell) becomes enraged and starts acting out.Lots of swearing, lots of violence, and lots of laughs to be had in this film. It was strange to watch as I had just seen another film, Past Life, that focused on the subject of anger and pain, and how it can eat a person up and destroy them. This film is yet another good illustration of that, as Mildred stops at nothing to make a point.The one-liners are amazing, and Mildred's speech to the priest who comes by to ask her to remove the billboards is hilarious. The movie is filled with strong performances and equally well-developed characters. We see all of their sides - violent, kind, vengeful, angry, sad; we finally realize they're just people driven in some cases to extremes.Harrelson's performance is touching -- we're prepared to dislike him but his sincerity and humanity come through. As Dixon, Rockwell seems like a monster, but once he acts out, he's able to focus his energy a little better.And then there's McDormand, a powerhouse. She's not good ol' Marge in Fargo. She's a tough woman with a broken heart who takes out her anger any way she can. It's a beautiful, multilayered performance. Highly recommended, asking the questions of where revenge and hatred can take us, and deciding when and if it stops."
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri",28-Dec-17,"Pretty cool cast, and interesting premise muddied by oddities, implausibilities, and a juvenile sense of story. Is this a film set in a world where crazy stuff happens as a matter of course, or a normal every day world where crazy stuff happens every now and then? In this film, I see pretty normal people doing normal things and having normal things happen to them, so why is it the writer/director chose to litter what could have been a very good film with SO much bizarro bs? And with literally ZERO character development? Three giant billboards THAT close to the road and THAT close together - I've driven all over the country and never saw that. Billboards in rural areas tend to be smaller and definitely not that close together for obvious reasons. WHO is this woman, Mildred? We know literally nothing about her beside the fact that her daughter was murdered. Eventually we find out she's divorced and has a son who lives with her, but if one is to care about the protagonist, character development is crucial. As it is, it's interesting to watch her do and say crazy stuff, but I couldn't care less about her.WHY is it, two male characters directly related to the protagonist have a girlfriend & wife 20+ years their junior? Do they live in a part of the country where such a thing is commonplace? What are the odds of that? Probably about the same as if your dentist won the lottery but then your mailman did also. Yes, possible, but very, very odd and distracting.Why does Willoughby's wife have an English accent? Was he in the military and met her while overseas? Is it common for a small town in Missouri to have British accented residents? If there was ANY character development, maybe we'd know these things. As it is, it's distracting and elicits questions that shouldn't have to be asked. $5000/month for three previously forgotten about, decrepit billboards on a road people don't use anymore? LOL. For someone who is supposed to be a savvy, tough, non-nonsense older lady with the wisdom of the Buddha, that's pretty dumb.A cop smashes office windows, assaults a man and throws him out a 2nd story window with no jail time. Really?! Why does Willoughby have fatal cancer? Seems as no more than a cheap device used to heap more disdain on Mildred. Yawn. Dixon ends up in the same hospital room as the man he assaulted? Is that supposed to be ironic? And again, what are the odds? Mildred firebombs the police station, nearly kills a cop, and then just says ""I didn't do it"" and that's the end of it?! Really? Some creepy stranger visits Mildred in her store and harasses her, THEN is overheard in a bar talking about committing a crime, maybe the crime in question, but alas even after Dixon cleverly retrieves dna from the guy, it turns out he's not even a local, and wasn't around when the crime occurred. Why then does the creepy guy know so much about the crime in question and WHY is he harassing Mildred!?!?!?! WHY?Then to top off ALL that nonsense, Dixon and Mildred decide to go murder the creepy guy anyway, LOL, how profound."
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri",16-Oct-17,"It seemed that the pregnant police detective Marge Gunderson from 'Fargo' would forever be the most memorable character of Frances McDormand's acting career. But now I'm not so sure. Mildred Hayes, the heroine from 'Three Billboards', is a serious contender. This might well be her best performance ever.The part of Mildred Hayes was written with McDormand in mind. Hayes is a divorced single mother, living with her son on the outskirts of a small, remote town. She had a daughter too, but the girl was raped and killed on a quiet mountain road not far from home. Frustrated by the lack of progress of the investigation, Hayes decides to rent three dilapidated billboards, publicly accusing the local police chief of incompetence. By doing so, she attracts the attention of the media, angers almost the entire town and causes a succession of increasingly violent actions.Although the film is about grief, anger, revenge and violence, it is extremely funny. Above all because of Mildred Hayes' stubborn character and her ability to verbally humiliate people by her extremely sharp tongue. The monologue she delivers when a priest visits her house to tell her she has gone too far, is priceless.Apart from McDormand's performance, the screenplay is another great feature of this film. The story is full of unexpected twists, gradually shifting the positions of the main characters towards each other. None of the characters are one-dimensional: they all reveal surprising parts of their personalities as the story moves forward.And then there is the overall, almost Coen-esque atmosphere of a small town full of colourful characters. There is a racist cop, a friendly midget, a smart advertising guy and a pretty girl who is so dumb she doesn't know the difference between polo and polio.It is hard to mention something negative about this film. 'Three Billboards' is, from start to finish, a great movie. I can't imagine anyone not enjoying it."
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri",25-Nov-17,"I will say that I enjoyed this film, mostly due to Frances McDormand's performance. It was surprisingly funny given its subject matter. But after thinking about it for a few days after watching it, I have to say a few words about the writing, because it seems everyone is raving about how ""Oscar worthy"" the writing here is, and at first glance, I thought so too. But thinking back on it, I'd have to say the writing is actually pretty sloppy. There's a lot of stuff here that doesn't make a whole lot of sense, and I mean a lot. I can't explain this without revealing spoilers, so be warned.--Most strikingly the (deputy?) Chief Dixon violently attacks Welby, busts his face with his gun, throws him out of a window and proceeds to kick him while he's down, all in eyes view of the new Chief Abercrombie. Sure, he gets fired. But not arrested? Not even sued?--And as for Abercrombie. He shows up the morning after the previous Police Chief died and declares that ""they"" sent him as a replacement. They who? Is there some force outside of Ebbing that dictates who their police chief is? That part really didn't make any sense to me. Also, replacing one of the main characters halfway through the film, a character we're starting to get to know, with a stereotype that we don't know anything about, was rather odd.--Someone lights the billboards on fire. But apparently only the paper on them burns, not the old wood that's been sitting there decaying since the 80s, because they are able to paste duplicate posters to the existing structures without any problems. That's laughable. That old wood would have been a pile of smoldering cinder.--Mildred is portrayed as such a tough-ass, assaulting a dentist, kicking children in the crotch (with no repercussions I might add), storming into the police station spouting vulgarities, but when she's confronted by a guy who suggests he's actually the one who killed her daughter, she freezes and seems helpless. One might say the fact that she didn't go psycho in this scene is what makes this screenplay original but someone else, like me, might argue that it's just out of her character and doesn't make a lick of sense.--Chief Willoughby for some reason is an old geezer but has a young, attractive Australian wife. He also has two young girls. Yet he's completely vulgar around them. While instructing them about a game of fishing he invents, he calls the blanket they are sitting on the ""god-dam blanked""--twice--to little four or five year old girls. He says to his wife later that it's her turn to ""clean the horse *hit"" out of the barn. OK, I actually have quite a bit of experience tending horses. It's not called ""*hit"" it's called manure and you wouldn't even call it that--you'd just say ""clean the barn"" if you really owned horses. The writing of his character, other than the scene between him and McDormand while they were sitting on the swings, was actually horrible.--Mildred burns the police station down, throwing 5 Molotov cocktails out of the still broken windows of the advertising agency across the street (not boarded up by then?). And the new Chief just accepts the explanation that she didn't do it because she was with James. No more investigation. Ho hum. Police station burned but oh well. And then a few scenes later, Dixon is apparently in the suppose to be burned down police station sitting there having a conversation with the new Chief.--Dixon is a complete jerk to the bone. He gets a letter postmortem from the now deceased Chief. Suddenly he's a good guy. Yeah right.I could go on and on with this but I'm afraid my word limit here is going to expire soon. I'll still give this film a 7 star rating because I DID enjoy watching it, but the writing here is really not all it's cracked up to be. It does feel like it's a big novel with a lot of twists, but in retrospect it's more like a parody of a big novel with a lot of twists, and the twists don't make a whole lot of sense."
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri",03-Dec-17,"The actors are superb, but the script fails in several ways. My immediate reaction, seeing the opening shots, was that this was not Missouri. I guessed it to be the southern Appalachians (where I have spent a lot of time), and so it was. The characters did not behave or speak the way real Southerners speak or behave. Martin McDonagh has written his fantasy of what he thinks Southerners are like. He got it wrong. He works in film sort of the way D. Trump works in politics--he shocks, he amuses, he appeals to our base instincts. But he doesn't tell a coherent story. The central characters are not sympathetic, and indeed they are borderline sociopaths, including Frances McDormand's character. Sam Rockwell's ludicrous cop character would not be tolerated, even in small-town South. Viewers are left to wonder why Woody Harrelson's wife is a much younger luscious babe with a foreign accent. (Also a real Southern man, even a lout like Harrelson's character, would not use foul language in front of his two small daughters.) The period was not clear; observing the cars in the film it seemed to be the 1980s or 90s. Yet there were no computers seen in the police headquarters of the advertising company office. Yet near the end McDormand uses her cell phone. Other reviewers have noted the recurrent racism of the screenplay. I kept wanting to get up and walk out, but stayed for a simple reason. As with any whodunnit, I wanted to find out who did it. Guess what? McDonagh never lets his audience know who did it. As author he must know, yet he keeps this information to himself."
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri",16-Feb-18,"First, let's all just accept the premise that police beat up random black people for no reason whatsoever. Also, police are inept, because they can't find someone to arrest for the murder and rape of your daughter, even though there is zero forensic evidence. Next let's take a moment to reflect on the time you told your daughter ""I hope you get raped on the way too"". Now it's time to start lashing out at the world because you are angry. Start by committing 2 felonies against a dentist. It's also a good idea to go into a police station and tell them what horrible people they are. When your signs get set on fire, climb onto one of the burning signs and stand at the top of the flames. Next, fire-bomb a police station, because you are still mad, even though there is still no evidence or suspects. Finally, if you can't find the actual person who committed the crime, instead go murder a complete stranger on a hunch. This is all very profound and heart-wrenching...can't you tell by the music?The police chief isn't so bad though, because he has cancer and is spitting up blood. He thinks it's best to leave the hospital, because what do doctors know about dealing with cancer. He doesn't want his wife and kid's final memories of him to be slowly dying in a hospital, so instead their final memories will be of him blowing his own brains out in the barn. Thankfully, a streetwise black police chief came in to take over for the inept and racist white police officers. Now things will finally get done."
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri",12-Feb-18,"I can understand how one can adore this film. Of course it had some very interesting ideas and tried to make certain points, but in the end it was a tonally indecisive mess. Here are some of my main reservations: - The script is overexplanatory and relies too much on coincidence, while it plays down the consequences the main characters would have in real life, when acting nuts. I dare you to go burn a police station down, remain at the scene (regardless of the fact that you are virtually the only suspect) and tell me what happens afterwards. Yes, I know McDonagh would have argued that we shouldn't take the movie at face value, but there are too many -and too important- plot holes to forgive (and this is not a buddy cop comedy for god's sake). - In a cringeworthy flashback scene, we see the mother and daughter quarrel about Angela going out, only for them to prove their precognitive skills (Angela said she hoped she would get raped on the way, and Mildred agreed with her). Well, I'm positive there were more subtle ways to show why Mildred is filled with remorse. - I thought Rockwell's character to be too cartoonish at times. McDonagh said that they had to cut a lot of material because there were tons of moments with Rockwell's character that were too comedic, but there are still many way over the top moments left in the movie. - Willoughby is portrayed as a genuinely decent guy. Honestly, I don't get how can a Sheriff let his racist officers deal with black people the way they did and still qualify as a good person. Supposing he was an ignorant, illiterate redneck, I would be much more willing to excuse this kind of behaviour."
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri",10-Feb-18,"Seriously, any critic that says this movie is somewhat good, should chance his job. Is the acting great? Yes
Is the story-idea great? Yes
Is the execution great? No way. It almost never happens that i yell at a screen in anger because a storyplot is so unrealistic that it hurts. But here it happend. The scene where Officer Dick throws out the advertising guy of the window and then just sits within his station, nobody arresting him, not even the new Chief that clearly saw it and fires him would arrest him - well, this is just not even in the united states of police brutality realistic and just ruins the whole movie for me. From there on, the movie was just a pain. And im almost never not on the line of critics...dont understand it."
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri",12-Jan-18,"This movie is so obviously trying to be edgy & artsy, it might as well have had someone walking out with a sign at key moments- ""laugh here"" ""gasp here"" ""tear up here"". I love the actors, the characters were super colorful & the movie wasn't boring. Other than that, it felt like someone took a template of a dark comedy & then just left out the realism. Going out on a limb here but I'd say people don't normally use the F word & C word that often. Policemen don't act like that ...and still have a job. Assault, arson or attempted murder are causes for arrest (even for cops)People don't let their friends do jail time for the sake of leaving signs in the street (that was a friend, right?)That 19 year old girl would not be attracted to the exMaking fun dating a little person might have been funny 20 years ago (and then his enlightening 'look in the mirror' speech as he left the table was ... meh) Also, that was quite a 180 for the vicious, racist cop who throws people out of windows. Too many unrealistic situations & reactions. And why did that random suspect guy come into the shop in the first place? Did he rape someone in Irag? And throw a turtle in there while you're at it.Sorry, love the premise, love the actors but sometimes I think critics just have a checklist they go by."
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri",15-Feb-18,"This movie I went into almost blind, but I came out of the theater with it probably being my favorite film in the last year. This film is so smart at being able to keep you at the edge of your seat from simple things that they plug into the film. Heartbreaking and tense situations in the first half of the film come back in some shape or form that leave you questioning what is going to happen. There was genuinely no predicting what the characters were going to do and how they would react to certain events. This unpredictability doesn't just apply to situations, but possibly more notable in character arcs. Without giving to much away, there is a character in this film that does everything possible for you to hate them in the first half, and by the end of the film you are rooting for said character. There's times where the characters that you cared for are becoming real and dis-likable in certain scenes, but to the point of more so being genuinely worried about how their choices will affect them.Every actor in this film did so tremendous as well. I really can't think of an actor or actress that outshines the rest. But if I had to pick favorites, Frances McDormand and Sam Rockwell were just that. But a lot of that just has to go into the writing of the characters themselves. The cinematography in this film allows the actors to take advantage of facial expression. There's a scene relatively early in the film that is mostly sitting and staring but the actors have such convincing movements and gestures, it goes to a point where you don't need dialogue to tell what they are feeling and what they are thinking about.Really the only issue I have in this film is some scenes felt a little unnecessary. Can't give away too much without spoiling, but in a film where every character goes through in arc, there's one character that is just there to break tension and crack personally unfunny jokes. But this character did not affect my score and they were barely in the film.I highly recommend checking this out."
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri",22-Nov-17,"The good: performances by Caleb Landry Jones, Sam Rockwell, and Lucas Hedges (despite not having much screen time.) There were some moments that were pretty cool and did some new things, but overall this film isn't worth much. It is basically a string of mean people going along and doing mean things, to no end. Nobody learns anything, the little growth that does occur is quite forced, and a lot of it doesn't seem very grounded in reality. The tone is confused, bouncing back and forth between Nickelodeon comedy and a dark drama, making it hard to take seriously. Woody Harrelson seemed to care so little about his voice-over work in the middle of the film, but that's understandable when the writers didn't seem to care much either. The editing wasn't great and offered unclear communication at times. I don't know who picked Abbie Cornish for this, or anything, as she is an exceptionally poor actress. I think we're supposed to be emphasizing with the main character, but that's hard to do when she's a callous wrecking ball. Making a film about a parent dealing with trauma of this nature is a great premise, but there's a certain humanity lacking. I disconnected with this film when she didn't take the billboards down the moment her friend got arrested. I assumed it was a given- how could you let your friend rot away in jail while this futile ploy of yours is the single cause? And how was the friend OK with that upon being released? This is not a strong person, this is a petty and immature person who is seeking solace purely for selfish reasons. It is also completely overlooked that she is harming her still-alive son throughout the course of all this. Finally, we have one scene with Mildred's daughter, who is the cause of all events that take place in the film. Not only was the actress incapable of carrying this scene, but it was also hard to believe she was the daughter of Mildred. Overall, an unaware film that seemed to try to be catering to the current political climate."
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri",05-Jun-18,"The drama of Martin McDon, known primarily for his ability to violate the foundations of modern drama, can easily be considered one of the best in the outgoing year.In the center of the picture is the mother of the deceased girl, seeking justice and justice in a rather cynical manner and the unquenchable hope for which is the meaning of life, along with a single son and a worn blue overall.""Where is the cliche?"" - I thought, and already on the 10th minute of the movie I stopped speculating about the development of events and trying to predict the replicas and actions of the characters. This unpredictable plot was not in my memory for a long time, considering that all the events taking place for nearly two hours (and there were an unlimited number of them) surprise with their surprise and sometimes absurdity.The non-linear structure of the film makes the viewer systematically ask the question, ""What will be the end?"", But ""What will happen tomorrow?"". The same question is asked to themselves and all the characters: the divorced mother Mildred, who is already desperate to find justice, ultimately lives by today and actually loses the intelligible for herself and for the surrounding purpose, humiliating the policeman and accusing them of racism, sexism and other "" "". Sheriff Willoughby, who learned that he has cancer, does not know what will happen to his reputation after his death. The sheriff's widow does not know what will happen to her daughters. The assistant to the sheriff Dixon sits up his pants and reads comics, having no motivation, no prospects, nothing.The appearance of three billboards in Ebbinge literally leads this small town into a rage. The hunt for Mildred is accompanied by violence on the screen, both from her side and from her ill-wishers (scenes in the dentist's office, as well as in the advertising firm). Even the church involved in the scandal gets gets on the forehead of Martin McDonagh, who calls her ""a criminal group"" and ""lovers of little boys, and in general, boys."" The whole town shows all the dirt, like a fish, rotten from head to tail, stinks of hypocrisy.Thus, the unyielding willpower of the heroine Francis McDormand and her motivation, which at some point is questioned, makes the actress, perhaps, the main nominee for the Academy Award. And the abundance of all sorts of characters (including the hero of Sam Rockwell), well-designed, but sometimes fantastic scenario and satire on acute social problems (racism, sexual harassment, police lawlessness, etc.) make the Three Billboard reflect modern disgusting reality and valuable ( if not the most expensive) coin along with Bruges and the Seven Psychopaths in the treasury of the talented Martin McDonagh.Bravo, McDonagh!"
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri",15-Sep-17,"What a movie and what great acting. Frances McDormand has done amazing job and deserves awards for playing Mildred Hayes. Although a very serious subject, this movie is a comedy.The punch lines are to the point and absolutely hilarious. I went to the Toronto International Film Festival to watch this movie and boy, do I consider myself lucky to have decided to watch it.The story, screenplay, direction are amazing. After The Grand Budapest Hotel, this movie comes as a breath of fresh air."
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri",02-Dec-17,"I really wanted to like this film. But it has plot holes you could fly a 747 through. The characters do completely nonsensical things. And for the love of God, if you're going to make a place a character in your movie, at least actually film it in that state. Like maybe ... I don't know ... In Bruges?"
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri",17-Feb-18,"I went to see this movie because I hadn't seen any trailers to it. It's something I do because trailers are unreliable and spoiling, but also this case was based around the sheer number of good reviews. I can't even describe how surprised i was when i started to invest in the drama, and I really got my money worth when seeing it in the theaters. This is a movie that grips you good from the start, and holds the tension of the backstory right up until the end. The characters are phonemically written, and the actors did a hell-of-a-good job portraying them. This is a movie that could have been written off with a ""strong protagonist""-cinda-story, but unfolds to a much more deep and philosophical tone. To be honest! not much happens in this film, but because of the powerfull characters within - every little detail about their lives, becomes of great importance throughout. I can say without a doubt, that this is my favourite movie of the year (2017...Ofc.)"
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri",07-Dec-17,"I wanted this movie to be great. It wasn't. The performance by Frances McDormand is good but not great. She's very good at showing overwhelming anger, but that's all she's allowed. Her character never gets the chance to breathe. Blame the script, not her--she's a terrific actor, but this is a one-note performance.2. There is a sub-theme about race. Race is an important issue and deserves to be treated honestly, but in this movie, it felt like a side-road that led nowhere. (It actually feels like moral preening on the part of the scriptwriter. It didn't add much to the movie's meaning.3. Wonderful performances by Woody Harrelson and Sam Rockwell as a police chief and officer. Woody especially brought grace to a character who at first seemed unsympathetic. (BTW, McDormand's ex-husband has a young and beautiful girlfriend, and that relationship is treated as awkward and shameful. Harrelson's wife is young and beautiful, and that relationship is treated as idyllic.) 4. Police officers don't talk like that among themselves or to others.5. I particularly didn't like the Chief's take on racist cops, saying essentially that all cops are racist. That may be accepted as dogma by some Hollywood screenwriters, but any chief who talks about his beloved employees--or cops in general--like that shouldn't be a cop. Coming from this character, the sentiment is cheap and clunky and inexplicable.6. There are a couple of plot holes wide enough to drive a billboard through sideways. The most egregious (no spoiler here) is what happens (actually what should have happened but didn't) immediately following the window scene. (You'll know the scene when you see it.) The thing not happening was necessary keep the plot going. Everything that happened after that feels tainted as artificial and contrived. Likewise a later scene in a bar, involving a coincidence beyond coincidence.7. It's impossible McDormand's character wouldn't have been arrested several times in the course of the movie, for several serious crimes. Once again, he plot depends on that not happening, and thus the plot again is contrived.8. There's a letter delivered to Rockwell's character late in the movie which is full of Hallmark Card sentimental drivel. It can't be justified by either what we know of that character or what we know of the writer.In a world (as the movie trailers used to say) where we are awash in numbskull comic book movies and incoherent special effects spectacles, it was a small miracle this film even came to my local cinema. Too bad I couldn't love it."
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri",02-Dec-17,"Combine the quirky characters of the master of quirk, Wes Anderson, and sensibility of adolescent wish fulfillment fantasy director Quentin Tarantino, and what do you end up with? The year's most overrated ""black comedy,"" Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. It's the work of playwright by trade, Martin McDonagh, who's been quoted as saying that he prefers writing for film over theater (why couldn't he stick with the stage if that's his primary area of expertise?).McDonagh's strategy is to appeal to both liberals and conservatives but in the end he remains squarely in the liberal camp. He serves up absurd characters that appeal to the baser elements in our culture but infuses them with ""hearts of gold"" so they appear to straddle both liberal and reactionary fences, but actually exist in none.Take for example his main character, Mildred Hayes (played by a haggard-looking, one-note Frances McDormand) who puts up the three billboards outside of town, frustrated by Sheriff Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) and his small town police department's inability to catch the man who murdered her daughter seven months earlier. The foul-mouthed Hayes functions outside the law and McDonagh throws a bone to reactionaries, asking us to approve of Hayes' desire for revenge and endorsement of vigilantism.McDonagh's other rebel is Officer Jason Dixon (Sam Rockwell), a racist who tries to top Hayes in her quest to be the top-rated anti-social misfit in town. First he arrests Hayes' co- worker pal Denise on trumped up marijuana possession charges and after he learns of Sheriff Willoughby's suicide following the revelation of a cancer diagnosis, he goes after Red (the man responsible for renting the billboards to Hayes) and throws him out a second floor window (instead of arresting him, the new black police chief merely fires him! What's up with that?).Just like Hayes, Dixon finds a scapegoat to assuage his guilt over Sheriff's Willoughby's death. When Hayes finds her billboards ablaze, she naturally pins the blame on Dixon and firebombs police headquarters. It's at this point that McDonagh rather simplistically attempts to redeem his protagonists. The saintly, all- knowing Willoughby, in a letter he leaves for Dixon after his death, reassures the errant former officer that he's not such a bad guy after all, provided that he gives up his bigoted ways.After Dixon survives the firebombing at the police station where he went to read Willoughby's letter, he decides to help Hayes after overhearing a potential suspect who might have killed her daughter. During a fight with the suspect in the bar, he manages to obtain the man's DNA. In an original plot twist, the DNA does not match and the potential murderer is ruled out as a suspect in Hayes' daughter's death.With Hayes apologizing to Dixon for the firebombing of the police station (she escapes being charged aided by an alibi from a dwarf who lives in town), the two vigilantes make their way to Idaho to seek revenge on the now ruled out suspect in Hayes' daughter's death, as they are convinced he's guilty of other crimes of rape, and deserves punishment.McDonagh, however, is uneasy with the idea that Hayes and Dixon would actually go through with their extra-judicial act-so he throws in a caveat. As they're talking to one another in the car, it's probably the unheard voice of the goodly Sheriff Willoughby which is still in the air. Hayes and Dixon express doubts about actually going through with the plan-the implication of course is that they will not engage in another act of violence-that they in fact have ""learned their lesson,"" and now are ready to act as law-abiding citizens.It might be reassuring to a liberal audience that the bad guys suddenly become ""good""-that there is a measure of redemption for the two who have become unhinged by the deaths of people close to them. In reality, vigilantes remain vigilantes, and such reversals in outlook are highly unlikely. But even if one accepts the improbable Deus ex machina, McDonagh's willingness to excuse all the prior bad conduct, suggests a crack in the screenwriter's moral compass.Ultimately, McDonagh wants his quirk-fest both ways. He revels in the bad acts of vigilantism, appealing to the aforementioned ""baser instincts""; but offers up redemption for his bad actors, in the form of a martyred lawman, who like a saint from above, offers words of wisdom for the ages."
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri",02-Mar-18,"Martin McDonagh (In Bruges, Seven Psychopaths) wrote and directed this very tough but brilliant story about anger, revenge, agony, prejudice - and redemption. Every character in this dramatic tour de force is drawn with equal parts hate and anger - with a dollop of hope and forgiveness and reconciliation in the end. It is a phenomenal achievement. The language is saturated with foul/vulgar/trash type language but it fits the area and the particular character in this darkly comic drama. After months have passed without a culprit in her daughter's murder case, Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand) makes a bold move, painting three signs leading into her town with a controversial message directed at William Willoughby (Woody Harrelson), the town's revered chief of police. When his second-in-command Officer Dixon (Sam Rockwell), an immature mother's boy with a penchant for violence, gets involved, the battle between Mildred and Ebbing's law enforcement is only exacerbated. Mildred's son (Lucas Hedges) is seemingly the only stable character despite his absentee father (John Hawkes) and 19-year-old girlfriend (Samara Weaving) antics and his mother's foul pained mood. The pinnacle of angry young men is policeman Dixon (Sam Rockwell in a brilliant performance) whose movements include severely harming the sign maker (Caleb Landry Jones) as well as violating all manner of laws. Peter Dinklage portrays James, the 'town midget' whose role is also key to the denouement of the action.Rape, murder, arson and many other forms of violence fill the screen but McDonagh makes it all make sense. McDormand, Rockwell, and Harelson are astonishingly but then there isn't a weak member in this extraordinary cast. This is one of the best films of the year, despite the subject matter at the core of it."
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri",10-Nov-17,"it's unfortunate to use the word comedy, dark or otherwise, with regard to this film. unpleasant would be a better adjective. if you've seen the trailer you know what the billboards are about. if not, you'll know when you see the movie. revenge and guilt are being served up cold. deep down, apparently, every one has a heart of gold. racists, wife beaters. whatever. I did not buy it. others have."
Doctor Sleep,31-Oct-19,"Finally got to see my most anticipated film of the year and I'm happy to tell you it's everything I wished for and more. Flanagan has done an amazing job adapting the book from Stephen King and giving lovers of the Kubrick film adaptation of ""The Shining"" (1980) a cinematic sequel.
Now i read the book and while I enjoyed it for the most part, I found parts of it underwhelming. I feel in this film adaptation, Flanagan takes elements from the novel and manages to make them more darker and serious which in turn really helped address some issues I had with the book. He does make some serious changes though and while I embraced them I'm not sure how others who read the book will feel about them. ""The Shining"" (1980) to me and I'm sure a lot of you, is a masterpiece in filmmaking. I for one prefer it over the novel and with this film, it most certainly feels like a sequel to Stanley Kubrick's version and a love letter to that film. The last 30 mins or so are absolutely amazing and kudos to Flanagan for pulling it off.
Ewan McGregor does a great job as an adult Danny Torrance and Rebecca Ferguson captivates as Rose the Hat. The film sets a great tone with some stunning visuals and the score completely grabs you. How much you enjoy this film really depends on what you want out of it. There's practically no gore here and no cheap jump scares. What you'll get though is expert filmmaking from someone who you can tell really loves the source material he's pulling it all in from. Everything struck a balance for me that I was tremendously pleased with, top horror film of the year."
Doctor Sleep,07-Nov-19,"Rating 10/10
Clue from dreams. Finally i watched a good movie after almost 2 months. I went in to see this movie, mind you i had not read any reviews much less have seen any trailers. I was shocked by how good the movie was.This movie is really amazing. Great cinematograpy, great acting performance with great cgi effects. Thanks Mike Flanagan & Stephen King for making this kind of movie. I strongly suggest you guys to go watch it on the biggest screen you can get. I am sure that you wont regret what you pay for. I really liked it. Shine on Abra Stone !! Shine on !!"
Doctor Sleep,04-Nov-19,"The ever-beautiful Rebecca Ferguson and a favorite from the Fargo series, Zahn McClarnon team up to bring us some somewhat scary, but more so eerie/creepy moments in this adaptation of King's Doctor Sleep. For the most part, and with the help of Ewan McGregor who plays an alcoholic, grown-up version of The Shining's Danny Torrence, they pull it off.While Doctor Sleep is a rather drawn-out and, mostly, slowish-moving film, it still has enough to it, to not lose one's attention. The story-line is solid and engaging, although those unfamiliar with the book and looking for outright horror and gore, will find little satisfaction. There are a couple of scenes which can be construed as ""horrific"", but in my opinion, Doctor Sleep is not really a ""horror flick"" by definition. To me, it is more like an intense drama about good vs evil, with a couple of well-done 'end-of-life' scenes thrown in. :)What I most enjoyed about it, is that in this day and age where practically every story ever has already been made into a movie, this one's plot was just a bit off the beaten path and came across as slightly new and original in its approach, while still pretty seamlessly tying it in to the well-known classic: The Shining.If I had to add one con, it would be a somewhat minor one, in that, at times, the girl who plays Abra (Kyliegh Curran), who also possesses 'the shining', and who can communicate with Danny, delivers her lines in almost a stone-like manner, and at other times as if she is rapidly reading. It occurred one too many times, and I found that it took me out of the movie for just a bit.While good, the scenes leading up to the ending are a bit predictable, and the 'showdown' (remember, good vs. evil) leaves a little to be desired. For the most part, however, I can live with it, seeing as Rebecca Ferguson saves it by just being in it, and King and the creators do their best to come full circle. In short, like the entire film itself, it is satisfying-enough to where one can feel as if watching it, was time well spent."
Doctor Sleep,11-Nov-19,"If you are going into this film expecting it to be a straight up sequel to the Kubrick film with the same horror tone, you'll be disappointed, however if you have an open mind, this movie is very well directed and acted and the story is very compelling. This is more of a fantasy thriller than a horror film and I really like that about this film. It also does quite a bit of homage to the 1980 film, but takes it into a new and interesting direction with a deep underlying theme direct from Steven King."
Doctor Sleep,12-Nov-19,"This is easily one of the better film adaptations of a Stephen King novel, and also one of the better films I've seen this year.
Yet again, professional film critics have proven they mostly have no idea about the cinema of the fantastic (fantasy, SF, and horror). If you're a fan of the genre, you'll love this film - ignore the critics."
Doctor Sleep,01-Nov-19,"What a surprise... That wasn't so bad actually! Now, hear me out. When I first saw the previews for this I felt disappointed by the visual look of the film, as it was all too green-tinted and lacked the Kubrick-esque framing I want from a film like this (it being a sequel to ""The Shining"" after all). Remember, I care too much about the visual aesthetics of these things sometimes. Especially when it was clearly supposed to connect right to the iconic classic. The green tint stays throughout the film, much to my displeasure. Worked great in ""Joker"" though. But once I got what the story was and paid attention I realized I was getting invested. This is a different type of film while still remembering to pay huge amounts of respect to the legacy of the original. Once you do get to the elements that carry over from Kubrick's film it felt well earned. Interestingly enough they kind of blend well together too eventually. We delve into the supernatural aspects of what Stephen King was going after in his book, and that's completely fine. I don't mind a chilling spookie once in a while. Recently I've felt done with most of the modern day horror film tropes, so it's such a shock for me to say that I had a good time with ""Doctor Sleep"".The progression of where Danny Torrance's character goes to is a natural right step. They go for the 'father like son' kind of thing, and I was completely onboard with it. The ghost of Jack Nicholson's presence looms strongly over the story too, with Danny fearing not to follow his father's footsteps. The new story elements were able to grab my attention as well. Again, as soon as it clicked what type of plot/movie this was, then it worked. It's its own thing, and that's great. No ""Shining"" remake - except for some re-created imagery (handled with nice respect) - But most importantly: The story and characters moved forwards. Loved what they did with the character Rose the Hat. What a sinister yet oddly charming antagonist portrayed hypnotically by Rebecca Ferguson. Hope she gets the deserved credit. Ewan McGregor will always be Obi-Wan to me, but he was a fantastic choice to play Danny. He can convincingly make me believe that he's got the 'shine'. It surprises me how positive I feel about the movie! It's a neat little companion piece to the classic. Again, big props for them to go for their own thing. This is no ""Force Awakens"", if you know what I mean. You'll walk though memory lane here for sure. The difference is that it doesn't rely on the nostalgia to tell their story. It actually stands on its own. I'll say that if you're a big fan of the original, then it's worth taking a looksie"
Doctor Sleep,22-Feb-20,"It deserves a good rating because besides its slightly average story(imo), they still managed to make me watch the full 3 hours in one sitting without feeling bored for a minute and enjoying it. Good camera work too."
Doctor Sleep,31-Oct-19,"...mike Flanagan GETS IT. He feels it. Few people can translate this well from an original tale within a tale within a tale. YOU certainly can't!
If your heart doesn't beat to the soundtrack, and you don't feel those happy goosebumps several times during the film, then, history is lost on you.
After seeing this movie, you may have an awakening of sorts... and see the world's periphery in a new light...with details you may not have noticed before. At least that's what I hope for every person who gets a chance to enjoy this truly unique and amazing cinematic experience!"
Doctor Sleep,23-Nov-19,"Regardless of what Stephen King thinks about the Kubrick adaptation of The Shining, it is still fondly remembered by movie lovers everywhere. This new movie, however praised by King as being a worthy adaptation of his novel, manages to fail where Kubrick succeeded. It's more of a slightly serious take on a superhero movie than a horror movie.There is absolutely nothing scary about this movie, not even the few jumpscares it tries to pull are successful, and worst of all: everything that seemed enigmatic or mysterious in Kubrick's The Shining is quickly explained away and dealt with.In the end, it's a very in-your-face movie about learning to deal with your own fears, traumas and even issues inherited/caused by one's family, rather than a horror movie that will leave you puzzling over the meaning of things or human nature. Every single horror element is fully explained, every mystery is revealed, every (simple) analogy is spelled out for you. Nothing is left to the imagination. Even the very ""Shining"" from the first movie, an otherworldly awareness that very few people had, is turned into X-men mutant-superhero-like powers in this one. And, oh, the reason that some people have the Shining? TO FIGHT EVIL. The whole ""with great power comes great responsibility"" thing. Again. It's laughable. American culture is completely obsessed with the superhero narrative as of late, and it's seeping into what some deem to be psychological horror, yet it seems people are too dazzled by the state of things to notice and choose instead to just take it and perceive it as fine."
Doctor Sleep,09-Nov-19,"Almost four decades ago, Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining"" not only terrorized audiences, but also sparked plenty of unique reflection and analysis on its remarkable use of suspense as both a cinematic device and a tool for fostering character development of its protagonist, Jack Torrance. The film's impeccable attention to detail has also ensured that it is still studied and well-respected today. As a huge fan of the Kubrick film as well as Ewan McGregor, I was really excited for ""Doctor Sleep,"" but unfortunately, I found it to be a huge letdown.The plot of this sequel centers around an adult Danny Torrance (McGregor,) working in a clinic in New England while also trying to deal with a severe drinking problem. He must work to defeat an evil cult called the True Knot, led by ""Rose the Hat,"" after a 12-year-old girl who also has the powers of ""the shining"" gets in its crosshairs. I was never expecting this film to top the genius of Kubrick, but Mike Flanagan seems like a talented director who wanted to really honor the source material, so I was hoping for it to at least try to be meaningful.The first major problem with the film is its tedium. While the pace of ""The Shining"" was slow, it was slow in a great way, as in ""slow-burn to build up maximum suspense and dramatic tension."" On the other hand, ""Doctor Sleep"" just feels tedious. Large stretches of the film pass by with virtually no keyp lot or character development not explored in other scenes, and the film feels repetitive and like it's going nowhere after a while until we get close to the climax. The film also lacks the genuine suspense and tension of the original, since this tediousness impedes on any sense of impending dread. I also feel that the more sprawling narrative of this story as opposed to ""The Shining"" may have been somewhat detrimental to its sense of tension. It also lacks the psychological fear of ""The Shining."" Even though the True Knot and its followers are creepy, attempts to build up a real sense of terror around them generally fall flat. Ewan McGregor tried his best, but his performance is unfortunately rather bland and very limited in range. The only real positive of the movie is that it's fun to see the Overlook Hotel again, but the climax still doesn't feel fully satisfying. Not recommended. 4/10"
Doctor Sleep,11-Nov-19,"It's probably King's fault, but the bland story never seems to find its footing while slowly building up an excuse to go visit the Overlook Hotel.Ewan Mcgregor feels oddly miscast, barely moved by anything that happens and so making us not care about anything either. While most of the cast is there just to stand and talk (there's an awkward amount of standing in this movie), the lonely highlight Rebecca Ferguson is very animated, throwing everything and the kitchen sink to elevate the dull proceedings. But she only gets so far.When the action eventually returns to the Hotel, the last act barely connects to anything that happened earlier as it apparently was only there so that they could recreate the sets and scenes from the Shining. But everything is so poorly written that the Shining throwbacks come across dumb and pointless, draining the original story rather than taking it further."
Doctor Sleep,11-Nov-19,"While I don't consider it a masterpiece, I did enjoy the classic Kubrick rendition of The Shining, and I understand why it has the fan base it does. Seeing the trailer for Doctor Sleep and discovering Ewan McGregor was playing an adult Danny Torrance, I thought the concept might be interesting.Everyone acts fantastic in this film. I thought Ewan McGregor built a very nice character. If I had imagined how Danny might have turned out after the first film ended, I don't think I would have predicted it much different. There are a few intense moments with the villains (Primarily Rose the Hat and Snakebite Andi) that made me absolutely hate them (which is a good thing). I think the things they do in the film would make anyone want them to see a terrible fate.I found myself smiling at the call-backs to the classic movie, and when Danny returns to the Overlook Hotel. It's been a while since I've said to myself ""Oh wow, there it is"" that many times at a film. I will say there are a couple scenes at the Overlook that feel like they were written in to make the fan base happy rather than be part of the story, but nothing that drags on too long.As far as it being a scary film, you may jump a few times, and some scenes are a little disturbing, but by Stephen King standards, it's more of a suspense film.An advantage I'll give this film over The Shining is that even though the film is two and a half hours, it doesn't get boring. Not that The Shining was boring, but it is a very slow film. Stanley Kubrick loved to throw in very long shots in his films, and while I personally think they worked sometimes, other times they were excessive, and in The Shining, they were excessive to me.I think this film is at least worth a watch whether you're a fan of the Kubrick film or not, because it's sort of it's own film in a way. It shows enough of the classic film to have a connection, but also has a story different enough and good enough to hold it's own."
Doctor Sleep,31-Oct-19,"Major spoiler in here, you've been warned.The first 3/4 of the movie were incredible. Excellent directing and excellent acting. It kept you completely engaged. Kyliegh Curran was the standout and you'll definitely be seeing more of her. They did a great job of making you absolutely hate The True Knot. They were some of the most evil, vile villains I've ever seen in a movie. One part in particular where they kidnap a young boy was very difficult to watch.The movie falls a little flat in the third act when they arrive at the Overlook. It started to feel like one of those made-for-Youtube fan made sequels. I get that they had to reference the movie since more people are familiar with it than the novel, but they could've just done it with brief flashbacks. And the decision to not use cgi to bring back Jack was a bad one. It looked like Henry Thomas with a bad baldman cap.But all in all it was a very enjoyable movie, much better than IT 2."
Doctor Sleep,01-Nov-19,"Director Mike Flanagan had an unfathomable task. To both adapt a Stephen King novel, which is no easy achievement considering his uniquely descriptive writing style, and provide a sequel to what many describe as ""the greatest horror film of all-time"". Quenching the thirst of King's avid readers and cinephiles alike. So even without divulging my own opinion on Doctor Sleep, applause must be given for just producing this feature. That, unfortunately for Flanagan, doesn't result in myself excusing specific inexcusable filmmaking tendencies that taint, not just Doctor Sleep, but various decaying intellectual properties that have been unnecessarily drudged up again.An alcoholic scarred Dan Torrance, having endured the irrevocable dangers of the Overlook Hotel ('The Shining'), has his peace shattered when he encounters a young extrasensory girl whom is being hunted down by shine-draining monsters.First and foremost, I have not read the novel, although this should not come as a surprise. I have however, watched 'The Shining' multiple times. Now, what promotes the aforementioned horror as the best of its kind, is legendary Stanley Kubrick using the essence of King's novel and essentially making his own iteration of it. One that the renowned supernatural writer still, to this day, has mixed emotions for. So for Flanagan to introduce some faithful interpretations of Doctor Sleep, whilst maintaining the cinematic endeavour that Kubrick meticulously crafted, is as I said, unfathomable. And there's a perfectly valid reason for that. The overtly supernatural strands of the novels do not complement the genesis of terror from Kubrick's film. Which is why, with great regret, I have to report that Doctor Sleep does not work. It doesn't.A beastly behemoth that, whilst does stand on its own two legs, relies on heavy-handed storytelling techniques and nostalgia to tackle both mediums that inspired it. In tonality, they are irrefutably different from each other. But before the disappointing third act is tackled, let's address some positives first.Doctor Sleep is a shining example of depicting childhood trauma and how fragmented coping mechanisms are embedded throughout adulthood. Young Danny imaginatively designs mental traps so that he can hold the starving ghosts from the Overlook in captivity. Yet that wilful mentality does not prevent him from suffering with alcoholism, substance abuse and an insalubrious lifestyle that masquerades the trauma instead of curing it. Thematically, this is powerful, and grants the narrative a solid cohesion throughout. For the first two hours, you subconsciously warm to Danny due to the tormenting fears he has established throughout the two films. He's a pillar of ""the shining"". McGregor consistently captivated by depicting a fragile mentality through a physically demanding performance, maintaining the entranced demeanour of his younger character.The first hour, that heavily explained ""the shining"" and the intentions of the merciless antagonists The True Knot, experienced inconsistent tones due to the mass sprawl of locational change. One minute we're in a sleepy town, the next a woodland area, and then all of a sudden eight years have been and gone. The zippy nature of the editing and bloated exposition resulted in atmospheric terror being abolished. The tension was non-existent, and the imitation of Kubrick's directing style paled in comparison.Then, the second hour commenced, which is by far one of the strongest acts the year has yet to offer. Flanagan retained a surprisingly dark tone that, was so shocking, forced audience members to leave the auditorium. The mind-space of Abra, a precocious teenager who has ""shine"", produced a transcendental imaginative battle against Rose the Hat, leader of The True Knot. Ferguson, who portrayed the primary antagonist, was sensational. Equalling the likes of Pennywise as one of the most enthralling King villains ever depicted. Sinister, unrelenting and bordering on near-lunacy. Controlling every scene from just her eyes alone, she enhanced the palpable tension. She made the second act. In fact, she made the film. The interjecting gore and darkness throughout the middling act abruptly astonished me, and settled for a direction that I thought would control the underwhelming first act.The third act then arrives, and the entire story crumbles much like the Overlook itself. Plagued by an overshadowing sickness that 'The Shining' had produced. Nostalgia. Remember that time where Jack viciously chopped the bedroom door down with an axe? Or that moment where blood came hurtling through the hallways in slow motion? What about Room 237? The introductory swooping camera movement that Kubrick embraced whilst the Torrance's drove to the hotel? The typewriter? Slowly walking up the stairs in a confrontational manner? The snow-covered hedge maze? The twins? No? You don't remember? Flanagan has got you covered. Nostalgia is a powerful tool, yet it must be handled with delicacy. The difference between imitating and homaging is very fine, and unfortunately Flanagan settled for the former.So much of 'The Shining' is replicated in the third act, scene for scene, that it was a near-identical copy without the textual substance that accompanied them originally. The re-casting of the original actors, despite Essoe bettering Duvall's performance (although not difficult), felt unnecessary. Almost tarnishing 'The Shining' in itself. Danny walking through the dilapidated hallways for ten minutes whilst Flanagan incorporates identical sequences, had no purpose other than to forcefully remind you that this is the sequel. Literarily, it never progresses Danny's character or the plot. Rose the Hat staring at the blood-spewing elevators? Pointless. Danny staring at an axe encased in glass? A suitable nod to its predecessor. Do you see the difference? Between imitation and homage? The third act was littered with falsified copies, preying on the nostalgia of fans. It's uninspired. It's mundane. And it made me a dull boy.Creatively, Doctor Sleep managed to infuse the very best of its adapted novel and preceding feature, but embellished the very worst techniques when conveying the plot. Psychologically stimulating without installing dread. Extrasensory without testing the senses. Dimly shining amongst King's supernatural adaptations."
Doctor Sleep,10-Nov-19,"I didn't have a ton of expectations going into this movie but I thoroughly enjoyed The Shining (like much of the human population) so I was expecting a good continuation of the original story line. Overall I think Mike Flanagan was able to deliver.
The way the movie was filmed and edited really exemplified a typical horror movie. Doctor sleep includes a constant mist in the settings, there are a lot of dramatic slow panoramic shots, and the music is eerie and impactful.
The acting is pretty decent but in my opinion Rebecca Ferguson absolutely shined as Rose the Hat. Ferguson put in so much emotion into her character and her expressions throughout the movie were just so unsettling, it was pure perfection.
I didn't find Doctor Sleep to be very scary I might classify it as more thriller, there were a few jump scares and a few shots disgusted me but nothing really shook me to my core, which is fine.
Overall as an avid fan of horror movies and King I enjoyed this movie a lot and might even say it's one of the best horror movies of the year."
Doctor Sleep,14-Dec-19,"I haven't read the books. That being said, this doesn't feel like a sequel at all. Making a movie that's on the same quality as a Kubrick movie is a high bar to cross, I get it. But they could still try and get at least the atmosphere right. But this movie doesn't even try. Instead it is actually a cheap spin off with more of supernatural thriller stuff than horror. I wouldn't have been surprised if this one was made by marvel studio.The scenes are hastily shown, unlike the Shining where they took time to set up a scene and show stuff rather than tell directly. There's no ambiguity. The dialogues suck. It's just spoon feeding. 'Steam'. Seriously, 'steam'? Couldn't they at least put in some other name for that thing other than this corny name, 'steam'. Glad, they didn't call it water vapour. It's like they didn't edit the name after the first draft.They were trying to put in so much of stuff into the movie that the movie ends up being too long. They didn't have an idea what all to leave out from the book. So many scenes like the one where the Hat lady recruits the new girl could've been cut out. Some scenes that tell us about Danny's alcoholism could've been reduced.They just tried to turn this into a superhero franchise.What's with casting some lookalikes in the iconic characters of Shining? Why even bother bringing those characters back. Only Dick Holloran's character has some importance. But then, even his presence is for too long. His lines, acting, dialogue delivery, all these things are not even close to what we saw in Shining. Was there even a point with Danny talking with his father in the Overlook? That was nothing but fan service. Coming to fan service, the third act is one big unneeded fan service.The plot was somewhat interesting in the second act. But then soon it went into a generic path.Don't believe the hype. This is just like the countless franchise attempts they are doing nowadays that caters to a younger audience."
Doctor Sleep,09-Nov-19,"Although considered a timeless horror classic by both critics and audiences alike, Stanley Kubrick's The Shining (1980) remains famously loathed by Stephen King to this day. Despite the authors widely recognised disappointment with Kubrick's interpretation of his novel, the film has stood the test of time as one of horror cinema's greatest achievements. In 2013, King released a follow-up novel, Doctor Sleep, which provides the basis for Flanagan's latest King adaptation (his second following 2017's Gerald's Game) starring McGregor as a middle-aged Danny Torrance, still haunted by the traumatic events that took place at the malevolent Overlook Hotel decades ago. While regularly attending AA meetings, Danny secures a job at a hospice where he comforts dying patients with a little help from his supernatural abilities, soon acquiring the title of Doctor Sleep as a result of his unorthodox methods. Meanwhile, a group of quasi-immortals operating under the moniker True Knot seek to drain the steam from within supernaturally gifted children who 'shine', just like Danny, in order to retain their youth.Enter Mike Flanagan (Oculus (2011), The Haunting of Hill House (2018)) who was burdened with the insurmountable task of not only crafting an adaptation that King himself would be proud of, but also a sequel that would impress fans of Kubrick's acclaimed original. Flanagan, who stands as one of modern horror's most prominent writer/directors right now, strikes a perfect balance with Doctor Sleep. It is a film that establishes itself as a completely different beast to Kubrick's film, while also drawing just enough influence from what's come before to please die-hard fans of what Kubrick established with his own vision. Ewan McGregor is well cast as a damaged Danny Torrance, but it's Rebecca Ferguson's captivating performance as Rose the Hat, the enigmatic leader of the True Knot, that steals the show. Fuelled with malevolence, Ferguson's deranged antagonist serves as one of Doctor Sleep's most exciting performances, and she's an absolute joy to watch. Kyliegh Curran also turns in a solid performance as Abra, a gifted young girl who shares a telepathic connection with Danny.As is often the case with Flanagan's work, jump scares are practically non-existent. Instead, Flanagan focuses on atmosphere and tension to elevate the sequences of terror. During a grueling sequence that displays the True Knot's ability to drain children of their shine, Flanagan chooses not to hold back from depicting a scenario that will undoubtedly unease the most hardened of viewers. Stylistically speaking, Flanagan often channels Kubrick's visionary flairs to replicate certain shots that pay homage to the original film. Although both films are totally different from one another, Doctor Sleep serves as a terrific companion piece to the 1980 classic that fans of both Kubrick and King can appreciate. It's certainly an exciting journey with instances of some amazing cinematography (a sequence involving Rose scouring the night sky is a particularly captivating, dream-like moment), and Flanagan's screenplay is brilliantly paced, completely engrossing, and never dull. Doctor Sleep stands as the best Stephen King adaptation to be released this year, and one of the better horror efforts, too. Simply put, Doctor Sleep truly shines."
Doctor Sleep,03-Nov-19,"It makes sense that Stephen King was more happy about this film than the original. Tonally and aesthetically it has more in common with 'It' and the recent crappy sequel than Kubrick's film. In other words, it looks like most of King's writing reads - CGI laden pop-ghoul fantasy for tweens.It follows Danny as a middle-aged man plagued by horrific memories of The Overlook hotel, who discovers others with the gift of 'the shining', and those who would use it with nefarious intent...In my opinion, Kubrick's direction greatly elevated the source material of The Shining and gave it a psychological gravity and intense foreboding that is just not present in Doctor Sleep, where the simplistic dialogue, snappy pacing, bright colour palette and over-used CGI effects made me feel like I was watching an episode of Supernatural, but with a bigger budget, Goosebumps, but with cuss words and gore.If The Shining could be criticized for being too vague and open-ended, then Doctor Sleep is guilty of infantilizing its audience with wide-eyed 'here comes the aeroplane' spoon-feeding. Characters finish every sentence by spelling out exactly what they're feeling and what they plan to do. There's no room for the audience to use their brains, or interpret things at any stage.One can argue that it is wrong and unfair to compare the two films given the uniqueness of Kubrick's vision, but Doctor Sleep invites these comparisons by constantly referencing The Shining in flashbacks, in musical motif and by also relying on much of Kubrick's imagery to pedal its cheap scares.
In the finale, The Overlook hotel is revisited, but the manner in which this happens turns the entire thing into a crass theme park ride, with familiar ghosts popping up here and there like cardboard cutouts waiting to be knocked down with pellet gun. There is also a ridiculous 'Buffy-esque' fight sequence where a supernaturally charged Rebecca Ferguson takes out an axe-wielding Ewen McGregor with martial arts.It's risible stuff."
Doctor Sleep,11-Nov-19,"I was really wanting to like this movie, but it just wasn't there.
Especially after seeing all the high ratings, too many things throughout the movie had me scratching my head.
Definitely hard to follow a classic like The Shining, but this sequel could have been a whole. Lot better."
Doctor Sleep,07-Nov-19,This isn't adult fare as Kubrick's masterpiece was. As another reviewer mentioned it feels like you're watching Goosebumps most of the time. Infantile is the appropriate word.
Doctor Sleep,12-Nov-19,"When I first read that Stephen King was writing a sequel to The Shining, my instincts said it was probably a bad idea. Happily, sometimes my instincts suck. I thoroughly enjoyed Doctor Sleep. The book had me hooked with excellent characters and a small-scale narrative that actually had little to do with the events in The Shining, and certainly didn't pander to the reader in the way Hollywood loves to do (see South Park's ""Memberberries"" for more on that). I admire the way in which King handled this difficult sequel.I'm happy to say that I really enjoyed this movie as well, and highly recommend it. It is mostly true to the book, the acting is great, and the pandering is confined to the ending (the least impressive part, more on that later).The characters seemed as true to the book as should be expected. In particular, I thought Rose, Abra, Crow Daddy, and Danny Torrance were all bloody fantastic. Rose is an interesting character, presented in great yet mysterious detail in the book, and not easy to bring to life. But for me Rebecca Ferguson was flawless. Ewan McGregor makes for an excellent, likable-but-flawed Danny Torrance, and in one particular shot, I thought he channeled Jack Nicholson's acting very effectively, a startling moment.The movie contains some beautiful and haunting shots. Two highlights for me were Rose flying through the sky, looking for steam, and a certain shot of Grandpa Flick savoring the steam he's just consumed, looking like something out of Bloodborne. (The only thing I really missed was Rose's one-toothed face! Wish they had included that.) The Baseball Boy's torture scene was incredibly gruesome and hard to watch - but that, of course, is precisely its intended effect.The score is effective, frequently using the 'heartbeat' effect from Kubrick's The Shining, which produces an instant atmosphere of tension.
Now, in my opinion, Stanley Kubrick's The Shining is a masterpiece of art, and in my experience, no modern film comes close to the quality of its shots, audio, or filmcraft, including this one. But that doesn't mean that Doctor Sleep's cinematography and soundtrack aren't excellent in their own right.There are some interesting differences and similarities among the two books and films. Doctor Sleep (the movie) omits some interesting aspects of the book, such as Danny's sponsor and the love affair between Rose and Snakebite Andy. But that probably makes sense in terms of the screenplay.
More crucially, in the films' universe, The Overlook was never destroyed, thus giving the movie adaptation of Doctor Sleep the opportunity to.... Go back to the hotel.This takes us to the ending, which is the film's weakest part (the same is probably also true for the book). Going back to the Overlook and touring its key locations did nothing for me, and at that point I began to feel the movie's considerable length.But at that point I was already a satisfied customer. I got to see an excellent novel brought to life in an excellent way. Go check it out."
Doctor Sleep,12-Nov-19,"Yep. This movie turned into complete schlock for me. The acting was...meh, and the story was nearly off the rails. There was no character development past the 20 minute mark, no interesting ideas explored, and overall was little more than a fan service sequel with scene after scene going 'Hey, do you remember this part from The Shining?'"
Doctor Sleep,02-Nov-19,"If you go into this film expecting it to be anything like Stanley Kubrick's 1980s masterpiece of horror, you will leave disappointed. Let's just start there.Little Danny Torrence is now a grown man, and still haunted by the things that happened to him at the Overlook Hotel when he was a kid (understandably). Most days he drinks his hours away to silence the voices in his head. On a whim he travels to a new town and wile there, gets his life together, and meets a young girl Abra, who 'Shines' just like he does. Against his will he ends up protecting her from a group of powerful psychics, lead by Rose the Hat, who hunt young children with psychic powers in order to feed on them to make themselves live forever. In order to keep Abra safe Danny is forced to return to the overlook hotel and face his ghosts, in ore ways than one.Generally, this isn't a BAD film. It's entertaining enough. The problem is, it's following one of the most iconic horror movies ever made and it hard to forget that. There are a few great nods to the original, using both cinematography and sets and props to jog the memory of anyone who ever saw the original movie, so that's fun. But the plot is a little slow for me and lacked punch.Sadly most of this film was just...meh. It lacked the nail biting atmosphere that 'The Shining' had in spades. It lacked a lot of fear of any kind really. The recurring visuals (The naked Lady in the Bathtub for example) that were meant to be scary, by the end just induced eye rolls form me and while the acts of Rebecca Ferguson and her group of cannibalistic psychics were horrific, they weren't really scary. After the amazing experience of watching 'The Shining' last week in the theatre, watching 'Doctor Sleep' was just disappointing. I expected more.You do wait the whole film to see Danny return to the Overlook, and then when we finally get there, its anti-climactic and not really worth waiting for. Everything they do there to try and scare you has already bee done, you aren't shocked by anything you see. You can tell the director was trying to incorporate things from the first film, but his just comes off as a cheap imitation.But hey, don't take my word for it. Go see for yourself and leave a comment below."
Doctor Sleep,09-Dec-19,"The film is almost as bad as a Twilight movie, barely ok for a Sunday afternoon movie, but when inevitably compared to ""The Shining"" it's a one out of ten. It feels like an insult to a Stanley Kubrick/ the Shining film.
Mike Flanagan has been doing a bad movie after another; when it doesn't work, it doesn't work, just let the guy go flip burgers at McDonalds and make something useful with his life; making movies isn't one of does things. The acting from the child Kyliegh Curran is very poor, nonetheless we cannot blame someone that young, she doesn't have the experience, the training or the natural talent, the person responsible for the casting is to blame!
Ewan McGregor is a great actor and did some good acting in the movie; but he must be desperate to participate in a mainstream movie to accept being part of a project like this; nonetheless it is ironic , since the ""The Shining"" had a bad public reception, only after it became a classic and was recognized for the masterpiece it is."
Doctor Sleep,26-Apr-20,"I really see no reason why this movie was made. It has no real suspense and the buildup leads to nothing, its plot is cliche as they come akin to any superhero film and the whole highlight of the films seems to be references to the original movie, not even references but 1:1 remake shots of the original film, just why? why is this a thing? Great, danny is on his father footsteps, but whats the point and why should i care? you expect it to all come together but after 3 hours there is no payoff, you waster the time and money, the whole message is ""yeah, the kubrick film is cool"". Scenes drag on forever, it tries to use some of kubricks techniques but it lacks any sense of pacing and weight to it. I don't care about any of the characters, everyone is a placeholder to move the weak plot forward and you basically now how is going to play out 30 minutes in.But yeah, cool you got a jack Nicholson impersonator to remake the entire bar sequence , cool, danny is the one with the axe in the stair sequence, cool, some random character i don't care about is on the maze. I definitely needed to watch a tricicle sequence with a new kid actor, Redrum?? omg, i remember that!!! references you guys!!! that what makes a sequel good!!"
Clueless,11-Feb-01,"Director Amy Heckerling knows a thing or two about high school flicks, having directed the highly successful `Fast Times at Ridgemont High'. Heckerling put her talents to work thirteen years later for the next generation of high schoolers, writing and directing this hilarious satire of life at Beverly Hills H.S.  Heckerling takes a different approach from `Fast Times', which found its comedy in the absurdity of reality, depicting situations into which teenagers really get themselves.  Here Heckerling's comedy mostly comes from mocking the superficiality of the high school `in-crowd'.  While this is not the first time this has been done, few have ever done it with such blistering wit.  This film became the standard for a spate of 1990's high school flicks set on the west coast that borrowed many of its elements.The story focuses on Cher Horowitz (Alicia Silverstone), who is the most popular girl at Beverly Hills H.S.  Cher seems to be a superficial airhead, but this belies her conniving and manipulative skills at getting what she wants.   Superficial yes, airhead no!  In a plot derived in part from Jane Austen's `Emma', Cher works behind the scenes to arrange love matches between various students.  She even orchestrates a relationship between two teachers to improve their moods so they don't grade so harshly.  Like Emma, she is a master of love for everyone but herself.Heckerling does a fantastic job of presenting what seems on the surface to be a cotton candy story with lightweight characters, but really runs much deeper revealing subtle truths about human nature.  Her direction of the fledgling cast is superb, milking every ounce of comedy out of each scene.Silverstone sparkles in the role, which is probably not far from a reality with which she is very familiar.  She actually attended Beverly Hills H.S. with co-star Breckin Meyer, although she didn't graduate due to career commitments (she received a G.E.D.).  This film catapulted her to teen prominence with two MTV movie awards and an American Comedy Award as funniest actress in a leading role.  She plays Cher with both arrogance and vulnerability, and her comic timing is impeccable.  She also has a knack for physical comedy, with a broad range of contorted facial expressions and amusing use of body language.  The rest of the teen cast is also great, especially Brittany Murphy as Tai and Breckin Meyer as Travis.  Dan Hedaya is also priceless as Cher's work obsessed attorney father.This film is easy to like.  It is a light and funny spoof, but it still has nuance.  I rated it an 8/10.  For those who enjoy high school comedies, this is required viewing."
Clueless,17-Aug-06,"""Isn't my house classic? The columns date all the way back to 1972.""When romantic high-school comedy Clueless (1995) was released, it was immediately vaulted into cult-status and firmly stapled as one of the most original teen-flicks of the 1990s. 'Original' is perhaps a term wrongly applied since it is based on the queen of romance Jane Austen's Emma (1815) . But what Clueless did was update the classic story by coating it with high school drama, teenage girls and shopping and sprinkle it with heavy doses of humour.Emma is no longer Emma; she is Cher (Alicia Silverstone), a spoiled rich girl walking around in her Beverly Hills mansion in a bubble of stereotypes and teen-clichés -- but with a great big heart. So big-hearted, in fact, that she takes on the lost goofy new girl in her school to find her love and popularity, knowing full-well that it could destroy her own reputation. Clueless thus sees Cher and her best friend Dionne (Stacey Dash) on a mission to do good. Real good.All the detours this mission entail are captured brilliantly in the film, taking the form of love-interests, parties, shopping and misunderstandings. From Cher's grumpy lawyer-father (an hilarious Dan Hedaya) and her nerdy step-brother (a likable Paul Rudd) to her eccentric group of friends at school, Clueless is a superb ride of teenage comedy camp. Only just over 10 years old, it is still extremely dated today. But no matter, because the 90s clichés like skateboarding, Marky Mark and the catch-phrase ""As if"" just make it so much more contemporary and fun to watch. What elevates Clueless (1995) above generic high school comedy is its use of stereotypes. In most films they are unintentionally there to create a subconscious effect, but in Clueless they are made fun of to a much higher degree -- they are overblown and glorious. It brutally satirizes rich kids and their 'problems' and juxtaposes them with a classic, heart-felt love-story. The kind that only Jane Austen can write.9/10"
Clueless,21-Jun-20,"I love how the movie represent the new perspective about blonde girls, it show that you can be both popular and kind. it a bit boring but the mood of this movie is so good."
Clueless,19-Jun-20,"This is a very good eye candy film. Cher herself is very attractive. The interpersonal relationship is very complicated. Face the difficulties, be brave and resolve yourself."
Clueless,15-Dec-19,And a Cinderella story.Alicia Silverstone was really hot here. Just so thin and those legsOwn it in DVD!
Clueless,08-May-05,"This movie is way above so many of the others of its' kind. It's consumately likable, funny, sweet and sharp- the script is a killer, and the acting is fun and enjoyable.Part of the success of the film is due to the fact that it appeals to several different audiences, and on multiple levels. I first watched this movie with my mom, who loved the link it has to Jane Austen's Emma- all the main characters and the plot are direct modern equivalents to the novel. For instance, the famous passage in Emma inwhich Harriet burns all her ""mementos"" of Mr. Elton becomes the scene where Tai does so infront of Cher's gasfire. From this perspective alone, the movie is so fun and sharp to watch- even if your forte isn't usually American Teen High School comedy!But this movie works on a really dumbed down scale too- let's face it, not everyone is big on English literature. The movie has an awesome soundtrack, Paul Rudd is unbelievably cute as ""Mr Knightly"" or rather Josh- and my boyfriend leads me to believe that the same is true of Alicia Silverstone- who still sparkles 10 years later as a mid-nineties teen queen with good intentions, Cher. Her performance here is impossible not to warm too, unless you have some sort of grudge against Valley girls, inwhich case you might not like it so much. Seriously though, this film is a must see for anyone who likes some real quality comedy- I'm so fond of this film personally that I would suspect basically everyone would enjoy it."
Clueless,14-Nov-00,"This movie is another one of those feel good pictures you can't go wrong with. It's light and breezy like cruising the boulevard with the top down and it offers lots of laughs to boot.Amy Heckerling has brought us another winner with a great supporting cast. A young teenage girl coming of age in of all places, Beverly Hills. The lead character, ""Cher"" played brilliantly by Alicia Silverstone, is a self centered high school girl in the beginning of the picture who's only interests include clothes, cars and credit cards. As the film progresses, she begins to mature and actually begins to care about other people, not to mention her environment. It's worth renting anytime. Just like ""European Vacation"" it doesn't matter how many times you see it, it still makes you laugh and that's worth it all."
Clueless,30-Dec-18,"Iconic teen movie <3 brittany murphy is amazing in that movie, and alicia silverstone is gorgeous!"
Clueless,18-Jul-20,"Cher is a high school virgin who nonetheless professes to all matters of love, relationship, fashion and even wades into her father's law practice. She was named after a former singer who now does infomercials.That is where the story begins and it is a feast for the senses. There are genione funny moments, clever lines with all sorts of cultural references and the girls act all preppy an fashionable, and they are, but are not as well organized and in control as they appear.I really like the fact that they know their fashion and styles and are well put together and I really like how they make fun of slobs and people who have no sense of trying to make an effort.Watch this one."
Clueless,22-Jan-01,"""Let's set 'Emma' in a modern high school!""  Does this sound the obvious kind of movie gimmick that everyone uses nowadays?  Perhaps, but it's an inspired idea all the same.  Jane Austen's characters, and her readers, and the society in which her novels are set, like Jane Austen herself, are HEAVILY conscious of class and social standing.  No atmosphere quite so snobbish exists in the modern world.  EXCEPT, that is, in the corridors and courtyards of the right kind of high school.  And where else in the modern world would you find so many people who seem to spend all their time calling on one another?I was reminded of how well Heckerling moulded ""Emma"" to fit a modern setting when I saw the idiotic 1998 version of ""Great Expectations"", adapted by someone who somehow failed to notice how important all the stuff about class and snobbishness was.  It's clear that Heckerling understood her source. She isn't afraid to make changes - even radical changes, if the modern setting requires as much - and no character exists MERELY because they have an analogue in Austen's novel.  (The most crucial thing is that the Emma-equivalent be sufficiently charming; and so she is.)  The result is a film which is winning and satisfying, whether or not you know anything about the source material."
Clueless,11-Aug-08,"Just the other day I watched Heckerling's wonderful romantic comedy satire 'I Could Never Be Your Woman' and I thought I'd revisit 'Clueless'. The last time I saw it was 10 years ago and today I enjoyed it just as much. Heckerling's adaptation of Jane Austen's 'Emma' may appear like a fluffy teen flick on the surface but there is a lot more to it. It works on multiple levels and 'Clueless', in a way, is a social commentary as it reflects a reality that still exists in today's society. First of all, the teen life is very realistically portrayed albeit with a sarcastic tone (such as the striving for high grades, obsession with image and partying). It somewhat reminds me of 'Heathers' (another excellent teen satire). While 'Heathers' is a much darker film that looks at teens in the 1980s, 'Clueless' looks at the adolescents of the 90s. Moreover, Heckerling brilliantly uses different kid of comedies through one-liner and dialogue, situational, and slap stick.Then the class distinction too is cleverly demonstrated through the eyes of Cher. The characters too work on multiple levels. Cher appears to be a popular stuckup bimbo type lass but once Hecklerling allows us to dig a little deeper, we see that she is unintentionally manipulative and knows how to use her strength (her power of persuasion). Yet, she is good at heart and even though her initial intentions of getting the two teacher together was to get an A grade, she's happy with the outcome of her matchmaking and the acts that follow are with more sincere purpose. Tai too appears to be the dumb new girl but she is far more experienced than Cher and when opportunity strikes she makes a place for herself in 'society' (i.e, highschool).Alicia Silverstone plays the part as though it was made for her. She has the right looks, age, excellent dialogue delivery and is a total natural in performing. 'Clueless' was the film that made her an overnight star and a very promising actress however, unfortunately, her following movies have been disastrous and the actress rapidly vanished into oblivion. She is supported by an equally great cast that includes a goofy Breckin Meyer, a weirdly fashioned but still gorgeous Stacy Dash, a naive Brittany Murphy, a laidback Paul Rudd, a hilarious Donald Faison, a bitchy Elisa Donovan and a fire breathing Dan Hedaya.For me 'Clueless' is among the top teen films along with movies like 'Heathers'. Those who childishly dismiss it as a fluffy chick-flick don't know what they missed. I was watching '10 Things I Hate About You' which is an adaptation of Shakespeare's 'The Taming Of Thew Shrew' and while that film failed to engage me for the most parts, 'Clueless' succeeds in all departments because it's much more than just another teen flick. It's a highly entertaining satire and it's a nuanced teen comedy with a subtle social comment."
Clueless,23-Dec-01,"Silky-smooth, vanilla-coated pleasure about matchmaking in modern-day high school. Far from the insufferable smugness of all those '80s teen-flicks, ""Clueless"" is bright--in both senses of the word--clever, funny, fanciful and yet grounded in reality (a rich one). Alicia Silverstone is adorable, but the supporting cast is affable and seemingly carefully-picked (they all get their share of funny lines, particularly Dan Hedaya superb as Silverstone's father). Seems more inspired by Jane Austen's ""Emma"" than based upon it, with a few mean-spirited lines but plenty of lightly innocent laugh-getters. **1/2 from ****"
Clueless,25-Jul-20,"Not like all the other teen movies.
Honestly, I love this movie. Alicia was very attractive and the only misgiving it had was that the class-mate did not try to bang her, which is not realistic. The whole plot was full of cool, fashionable and well put together hotties, and being that backed up by comedy, at least for me anyways. I like Brit Murphy and that adds to the reasons I enjoyed the whole movie.
Alicia's body though: perfection!"
Clueless,29-Mar-05,"A generally quite well made, enjoyably stylish and interesting matchmaking tale aimed at teen audiences, the film manages to incorporate a number of very clever parallels to Jane Austen's matchmaking novel 'Emma' while also providing a good satire on high school life. The idea is somewhat simplistic, the plot is sort of predictable, and the young performers all look too old for their teenage characters, but these are all minor vices against this strong entry for the teen flicks genre, with a surprisingly very realistic and actually almost heartfelt performance by Alica Silverstone to top it all off."
Clueless,22-Aug-05,"I wasn't expecting much of this movie, until I started seeing it. It turned out to be quite entertaining. ""Clueless"" is about the shallow and rather stupid rich girl Cher Horowitz, who only cares about herself and how popular she is. But then she starts this kind of 'project', together with her best friend. One of the aspects of this project is about making a new silly girl of their school look as 'cool' as they are. This 'silly' girl is very well performed by Brittany Murphy. I hardly recognized her! The lead role is for Alicia Silverstone who gives an excellent performance as well. Furthermore there is another great performance Paul Rudd (who we also know as Phoebe's boyfriend in ""Friends""). Also Dan Hedaya and Breckin Meyer (Road Trip) are funny.Funny and very entertaining movie from the director of ""Look Who's Talking (Too). Definitely worth watching! 7,5/10"
Clueless,31-Aug-05,"Cher (Alicia Silverstone) is a popular ditz at her local high school in Beverly Hills. She's a spoiled, pampered little princess with all the right social connections and endless wealth. However she has yet to find a man in her life - all the Baldwins (as she and her clique of friends call guys they like) have been taken.When Cher receives a foreign exchange student, she takes her under her wing and decides to try and find her a boyfriend - ironically without having her own yet. Predictability ensues.I read ""Emma"" in early high school as I'm sure most kids did, and the movie puts a clever spin on the tale. Alicia Silverstone is surprisingly good in her role, perfectly playing a blond bombshell without a brain but a good heart - only Reese Witherspoon has done such a good job recently at portraying the west coast bimbos. (No offense to the west coast bimbos out there.) The movie's director, Amy Heckerling, has always been rather reliable on the whole and her direction is solid here - she could have turned ""Clueless"" into a crude, unfunny sex comedy with little wit or brains, but instead she takes a rather dubious idea for a film and transforms it into a well-made, well-acted, funny, inspired, lively, witty satire.Much better than expected."
Clueless,12-Dec-19,"I had seen it back when it was aired as I was a teenager, thus, the perfect target. I remembered it as being entertaining.
I then moved to England and as I found interest in English culture, I became aware of Jane Austen´s ´Emma´many adaptations, and this one was in the list. I must say that I was clueless myself. Out of curiosity, as I feel a bit ´too old for this stuff´now, I watched some extracts to try to remember what the story was about. And, yes, it is adapted to our 90´s but the clues are the same.
What makes this film different from a typical teenage one is that it is capturing the humour from Jane Austen´s book and bringing it to the 20th century. Alicia Silverstone does the perfect job of making this ´shallow rich pretty blond´ funny, vulnerable and good hearted. As to the ´teenage stories´, the extract that I watched again showed me that no matter how old we are, human nature is the same. Don´t be ashamed to enjoy it even if you are over your 20s as nobody really grows, we only evolve and this film is completey in Jane Austen´s spirit of catching personalities that will always remind us of someone we have met (or are yet to meet)."
Clueless,09-Mar-03,"I've seen this teen movie countless times, and it's still enjoyable to watch. The jokes do wear thin after several viewings, but it is still a funny film. The cast are all very good, although I do find Brittany Murphy slightly irritating. The plot isn't very deep, but at least it is there, as many teen movies lack this vital feature. I am a little worried about the characters only being 15/16 and acting extremely maturely for their ago, however that seems to be the only problem with this movie.
7/10"
Clueless,07-Jan-19,"1990s high school set version of Jane Austen's ""Emma"" is pretty irresistible, thanks to writer/director Amy Heckerling's likable portrayal of young people and even more so thanks to an incredibly endearing performance by Alicia Silverstone. Silverstone's Cher is blond, beautiful, and the most popular girl in school, and who takes it upon herself to fix the lives of everyone around her (i.e. helping a new girl get popular, playing matchmaker with unhappy teachers, etc.), even if it's to serve her own ends. What intrigued me most upon rewatching the film is that Cher is the type of character who is usually the villain of these sort of films, but in this film she's the likable heroine. ""Clueless"" is also unique in that there really are no antagonists or villains, with the possible exception of Silverstone manipulating the lives of everyone around her, but although her actions are self serving at times, she's never mean or cruel, allowing the audience to still like her character. Cher is a unique character who plays at being a cute ditzy girl, but who is secretly (maybe even to herself) much smarter than she appears, which paved the way for copycat characters like Elle Woods in ""Legally Blonde"" or Romy & Michele or even Cameron Diaz' character in ""Charlie's Angels."" One might argue that Marilyn Monroe did this in some of her film, but the ditzy blond was more of her real-life act. I'm thinking the closest cinematic predecessor would be Holly Golightly form ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" but that film was tonally very different that characters manipulations were quite different. But I digress. Likable performances in ""Clueless"" are not limited to Silverstone and extend to the cast as a whole. Two standouts are Brittany Murphy as Silverstone's Eliza Doolittle to her Professor Higgins, and a young Paul Rudd play's Silverstone's college age stepbrother, who she describes as he dresses funny and listens to ""complaint rock."" Following this film Rudd could very easily have gone down the road of handsome leading man type of roles, but instead chose a different career path, which I think made him a more interesting of actor. While the cast deserves a lot of credit for the film's easy charm, writer/director Heckerling deserve credit for not only creating likable well rounded characters, she also fills the film with endless funny banter, such as:Josh: Do you have any idea what you're talking about?
Cher: No. Why, does it sound like I do?Or:Cher: Oh look, Josh is dancing with Tai, he never dances.
Christian: I can see why.Or:Cher: Would you call me selfish?
Dionne: No, not to your face.Or:Cher: If it's a concussion, you have to keep her conscious, okay? Ask her questions.
Elton: What's seven times seven?
Cher: Stuff she knows!Besides funny dialogue, Heckerling also has some fairly heartfelt dialogue that's sincere (and still funny) without ever becoming maudlin (SPOILER ALERT!):Everything I think and everything I do is wrong. I was wrong about Elton, I was wrong about Christian, and now Josh hated me. It all boiled down to one inevitable conclusion, I was just totally clueless. Oh, and this Josh and Tai thing was wigging me more than anything. I mean, what was my problem? Tai is my pal, I don't begrudge her a boyfriend, I really... Ooh, I wonder if they have that in my size. What does she want with Josh, anyway? He dresses funny, he listens to complaint rock, he's not even cute... in a conventional way. I mean, he's just like this slug who hangs around the house all the time. And he's a hideous dancer, I couldn't take him anywhere. Wait a second, what am I stressing about? This is like, Josh! OK, OK, so he's kind of a Baldwin, but what would he want with Tai? She couldn't make him happy. Josh needed someone with imagination, someone to take care of him, someone to laugh at his jokes... in case he ever makes any. Then suddenly...Heckerling made her directorial debut with ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High,"" which was unique in it's honest depiction of teen life, and although ""Clueless"" is minus the explicit sex and drugs of Fast Times, the Clueless teens do live in a world that includes those real elements, but Heckerling makes it much more sweet and charming than Fast Times. The characters of Clueless are unique in that they are these sweet likable characters, but at the same time are not naive innocents. It's an interesting balance I realized I hadn't seen in many teen films, but I think it boiled down to the fact that the characters, while they do rib each other at times, are never mean, making the film incredible endearing. Also of note is the bright vivid photography by cinematographer Bill Pope (""The Matrix,"" ""Army of Darkness,"" ""Chasing Mavericks,"" ""Baby Driver"" etc.), who makes the colors pop and gives the film a pleasing looks and color scheme. Other supporting players of note include (now FoxNews commentator) Stacey Dash as Cher's best friend, Dan Hedaya as her high powered lawyer dad, Breckin Meyer as a skater dude, Wallace Shawn and Julie Brown as teachers, and ""Jaws"" screenwriter Carl Gottlieb as a priest. Lastly, I'm a huge fan of the General Public song Tenderness that's played over the film's finale and end credits, so it was kind of impossible for me not to fall in love with this movie. Overall, ""Clueless"" is a charming film that is much smarter than it pretends to be, much like it's heroine (how can a film that uses the ""Spartacus"" oysters and snails scene as foreshadowing be considered fluff?)."
Clueless,09-Jan-20,"Wow I remember watching this for the first time and falling in love with it. I recently watched it again and it's still a brilliant film and feels just as fresh and relevant now. Alicia is fantastic as Cher and plays the naive but loveable character beautifully. Brittany as Tai is fab and Paul Rudd as Josh is just gorgeous! You'd think you'd hate some rich, Beverly Hills girl for obvious reasons but you end up just really feeling for her as you get to know her as the film goes on. It's not crude and doesn't rely on gross or obvious stuff to get the laughs as the writing is just lovely and witty enough to not need those cheap ploys so often seen in teen movies. It really does stand the test of time. Fab!"
Clueless,16-Aug-14,"A fun teen comedy from Amy Heckerling, the director of the woefully overrated Fast Times at Ridgemont High and the first two Look Who's Talking movies. Clueless is the best thing she's ever done, in my opinion. It put Alicia Silverstone on the map. Well, that and Aerosmith videos. Silverstone is pitch-perfect as Cher, the role of her career. It's impossible not to like her in this movie. It's also pretty much the best thing Stacey Dash and Breckin Meyer ever did. Not to mention the first big role for Paul Rudd. As most everyone knows, it's based on Jane Austen's ""Emma."" For a teen comedy, it's refreshingly smart. The story may not be all that but there's lots of good dialogue rather than a string of F-bombs or Stifler-like characters. One of the few memorable '90s comedies."
Clueless,12-Dec-05,"When I watched Clueless on TV I didn't realize that it was a parallel to Jane Austen's Emma, but I began to figure it out. I find it very funny that the character that is somewhat similar to Emma's Frank Churchill is gay, which of course he is not in the novel. Also very funny is that Cher's unrelated stepbrother is a parallel to Mr. Knightley which is Emma's cousin! And instead of Emma finding Harriet's farmer unworthy, its Cher finding Tai's skateboarder unworthy. These modern updates are pretty funny if you watch for them. Overall the novel was modernized very well, especially if you have read Emma or watched the film version."
Clueless,18-Jun-20,"I had a tough time with this movie. I heard plenty of good things about it and was very much looking forward to watching what is considered a 90s teen movie classic. Try as I might to enjoy my viewing experience, I couldn't quite hurdle the barrier presented by an obnoxious and ruthlessly clueless lead character.Cher (played with tireless busyness by Alicia Silverstone) is a rich spoiled 15-year-old student who manipulates everyone in her path, occasionally to their benefit. She possesses a pathologically enormous ego that makes it impossible for her to accept criticism or even the slightest suggestion that she is anything less than flawless. In her mind, she can do whatever she wants whenever she wants, and the world should simply bend to her will as soon as she smiles and offers a flimsy explanation.Cher is meant to be bubbly and charming, but she comes across as unbearable and jarringly self-centered. She deserves a comeuppance or at least some sort of learning moment. I kept waiting for the story to weave its way in that direction, to the moment when she realizes she needs to improve as a person, but it never really happens. Instead, inexplicably yet to the surprise of no one, she gets exactly what she wants. All of it. Shortly after she comes to the realization that she's in love with a certain boy, the two get together. She wins.
Does the story have a point? Is there a lesson? Unclear. If anything, we learn that spoiled rich girls get what they want, but we already knew that.Aside from Cher, many of the other characters are fairly likable. No one jumps off the screen due to a unique personality, but plenty of guys and gals exhibit enough life from scene to scene to make me smile. There's the dopey skater boy, the guy trying way too hard to look cool, the awkward new arrival, and the teachers who tolerate all matters of unacceptable student behavior.For as much as everyone lacks self-awareness, they show a remarkable acuity for assessing others. Cher rattles off descriptions of the various student groups that make up the school. Her explanations lack depth but so do the characters, so it's hard to hold that against her too much. And Cher isn't the only one capable of these keen observations. Her best friend Dion astutely describes a college guy as going through his ""post-adolescent idealistic phase."" Though, he is later seen reading a book by Nietzsche, so his nihilistic phase probably isn't far off.If we had a different lead character/narrator, I probably would have enjoyed this movie much more. Alas, Cher put a hard cap on this movie, preventing it from rising to anything beyond a mediocre and forgettable shrug."
Clueless,17-May-20,"One of my favourite 90s teen movies! It's so much fun and I never get bored of watching it. The characters have striking and loveable personalities, the dialogue is witty, the fashion and music is iconic.. what's not there to love? The movie is not dull or bland in places as we constantly follow the main antagonist (Cher) tackle and go through the hilarity and mishaps of being a teenager in California. I think that Cher is one of the best teen antagonists to have ever been written. Although she is rich, spoilt and popular, she's actually portrayed as a nice person. Although the movie never paints her as a saint, as she makes mistakes and acts selfishly in places, we watch her learn and grow from them whilst realising her own naivety and 'Cluelessness', making her not only a fun and infectious character to watch, but also relatable and therefore an admirable person. The movie also has a quirky and lovely charm to it that never fails to put a smile on your face throughout. I love the fact that although it's branded as a dumb teen movie, it's actually very clever and funny, and has a deeper meaning rather than being about some shallow teens. In fact, it paints teenagers in a fair and real way ; Naive, self obssessed, but sensitive and full of heart. All I can say is I think some of the teen movies today should watch and learn. I'm talking to you kissing booth."
Clueless,27-Nov-18,I decided to give this movie a watch out of curiosity since I wanted to see how it feels to be a 90's high school student in California. I was so amazed at how beautifully this film showcased high school life in the 90's. I feel all good after watching this movie.Alicia Silverstone looked very gorgeous in this movie. Her character was nicely written. This movie will make you fall in love with her if you haven't already. Paul Rudd was awesome in his role. Movies like this make me enjoy teen comedies although I'm not a big fan of the genre. The 90's was such a beautiful time when people actually spent more time outside interacting with each other rather than on gadgets.Overall it's a great movie and definitely one of my all time favourites. It's a nice take on Jane Austen's novel and I enjoyed every bit of it. This movie makes me miss my high school days and because of that it will always have a special place in my heart!
Ad Astra,21-Sep-19,"I generally like slow burn psychological dramas which this movie is supposed to be. Holy mother of God is this a bad movie. They try to get you emotionally involved in the father-son drama but have one preposterous plot line after another.In order to get to Mars you have fly to the light side of the moon and then drive a car to the dark side of the moon where you are attacked by moon pirates. Moon pirates?On the way to Mars, you stop to answer a distress call, kind of like stopping to help someone with a flat tire. Of course you easily enter the distressed ship from the outside. And when you enter you are attacked by a rabid Rafiki from Lion King.Once on Mars, you are able to sneak into the rocket to Neptune even though you were standing on the ground under the rocket engines when the count down was at 10. And, for some reason, you had to swim underwater in a space suit quite a ways to get to the rocket.When you get to Neptune, you park your rocket, and I mean park, on the opposite side of the rings so you have to go through the rings on the way down to loony pops and come back through the rings with a makeshift shield that you removed from the outside of the spacecraft with no tools while wearing a spacesuit.To get back home from Neptune to Earth you are propelled the whole way by the nuclear bomb that you used to destroy loony pops' ship. The ship that was, by the way, somehow destroying the known universe.The moral of all of this is that we may be alone in the universe so we should all love each other.The End."
Ad Astra,19-Sep-19,"Saw the reviews for this and was really excited for it. But this was dreadful.
The story just doesn't make sense. Obviously radio waves just don't exist in this universe! If they did this story wouldn't have been necessary.
A guy needs travel all the way to mars to send a voice message to Neptune?? It couldn't have been sent to Mars? Brad Pitt needed to be in a sound proof room to record a message??
He's able to board a rocket as it launches? Obviously G forces don't exist either or Newton's laws of motion for that matter.
When is this set?? They had better Luna buggy's in 1970's!
A wave capable of power surges billions of miles through space but doesn't effect the source in any way!
Ridiculous character reactions ruin the acting too! The most important mission in human history and they pack pitt off on a commercial flight for secrecy?? With a geriatric?? My god.
I was actually laughing every few minutes.
If this was fantasy sci-fi fine, but this seemed to want to be ""realistic"". Baah. Space 1999 was more realistic than this.
By the end you have to ask what was the point and how are you not up for 3 counts of manslaughter?
It gets 4 stars for the visuals only."
Ad Astra,20-Sep-19,"Let me begin by saying that I'm being generous with my rating of 2 stars. This movie was a disappointment on so many levels. The science was completely wrong. There were elements of the cinematography and overall visuals that deserve some credit. But apart from that, the movie left much to be desired.As a fan of space movies and Brad Pitt, I went in expecting an epic, but left disappointed. On one hand there are movies like gravity that keep you on the edge of your seat literally gasping for breath. While this was a 2 hour closeup of Brad's face and had very little, if anything, to do with space.Here's what was wrong with the movie.
Firstly, the movie fails to show the vastness of space with skewed distances and timelines.Secondly, space, a place that requires calculations and accuracy down to the millimeter. But we see Brad eyeballing his jump thru rocks and debris orbiting neptune, while holding a piece of sheet metal as a shield, yet perfectly nailing his jump and landing on his rocket.Sneaking into a rocket from a magical airlock near the thrusters after lift-off ? Erm.... NO!Discharging a firearm in a pressurised confined space travelling through deep space, hmm... what could go wrong?Using a nuclear explosion as propulsion? Science and logic both took a major hit there.I could rant on......Somewhere between the unexplained lunar pirates and unnecessary killer baboons, the storyline just fell flat. Even an actor as amazing as Brad Pitt could not save the movie. It is nothing more than a drama about daddy issues, the setting for which just happened to be space. The backdrop could easily have been an old people's home and it wouldn't have mattered.The people who have rated this film highly are wannabe intellectuals who are pretending to understand a ""deeper psychological meaning"" that just isn't there. Don't waste your time or money on this one."
Ad Astra,19-Sep-19,"Now im a big fan of these types of films, I loved Interstellar, I loved the Martian, I really enjoyed First Man - I loved Apollo 11 (doco film) and i really liked Apollo 13.
I even enjoyed Sunshine for the most part.Now that has been outlined - i hated this movie Ad Astra - because:SpoilersOpening shot from Brad's characters shows earth spinning below - looked great - but then seconds later you see they are on a fixed Antenna, locked to the rotation of Earth - the first of dozens of really obvious and poor oversights! (How about the continuity of Moons gravity, once in the Rocket facility everyone is marching around with Earth grav - seconds earlier the rover ((based on a version 2 1969 variant?)) floated almost with no gravity influence)And the stupidity of the facility on the Moon - absolutely huge, looked about as big as downtown Vegas, but they are still driving around in open top rovers, and flying Rockets that look like last years Atlas Rocket or somethingRidiculous plot is established that requires Pitt's character to fly via the Moon to Mars to make a god damn phone call from a pathetic sound studio style booth to his dad, for WHAT!? Apparently to gain a reply, so they can locate the ship. Well they KNEW it was at Neptune (granted a big planet, but really, a phone call to a ship that hasn't been heard for 15years or something). Liv & Donald's characters should not have been in the film, these added nothing, and just added more frustration from the underwhelming utilisation of their known talents.BTW the idea that you can casually stop midway from Earth to Mars to check on a distress call was utter CRAP- they had to be going at something like 525,000mph to get to Mars in the 6 days or whatever the ship said, and the idea that they could stop, make the door call (to a ship that had rampant Chimpanzees solely there to remove the Captain character) and then get back up to that speed is pretty far reaching. The bad acting by supporting roles, such as the fumbling Co-Pilot who froze during landing, and my favourite - the lady in the check in area on Mars, who was flapping fingers on the key board vaguely like it was a 8yr olds play or something.The hilarious water manhole on Mars cracked me up - WTF and why was there a rope thing to grab?
Also - at the base of the rocket below the engines - flame pit area - there is a casual Electrical Box for WHAT?Everything that happened whilst watching this movie pulled me closer to getting up and leavingI could go on"
Ad Astra,18-Sep-19,"Movie rant. Sorry!Ad Astra. Who is saying this film is good? Are you kidding me it rates on my top ten worst films of all time list.Spoilers ahead, don't read if you're planning to see this god awful film.
Things wrong with this film.Brad Pitt was pegged as some super dude, doesn't panic, heart rate doesn't go above 80 robot until he thinks about his dad. Then he becomes an emotional wreck.On the way to Mars they have to stop and nip on board a space craft that's been taken over by angry space monkeys. The only reason this was here was to kill off the captain so that brad Pitt could land the space ship when things got bumpy (because the second in command was to scared to touch the controls?)Throughout the entire film there was no feeling of the vastness of space. In fact it made it feel like Jupiter and Neptune were just down the road.Moon pirates, what were they about? What was their goal when attacking them. Some suggestion of hostage taking which is weird cause it seemed like they were trying to kill them all?You won't get to Neptune without me? Erm I'm pretty sure they would have and accomplished exactly the same goal. Guess you didn't need to kill them all after all brad? But it's ok because when you get back to Earth all will be forgiven, forgotten, well one of them.The heroic leap from one space ship to another using a panel to deflect all of Neptune's ring rocks. Erm not sure that would work. Hold it gets better. I'm going to use the nuclear explosion to propel me home. Erm....... no.Tommy Lee Jones after spending god knows how many years on the space ship trying to achieve his goal of finding aliens going so far as to kill his crew so that he could carry on. Just leaves without any fuss. Oh no changed my mind I'd prefer it if I just floated off into space. Ok dad see you later.The upshot is this feels like one of those films that's a really slow build up with a massive twist at the end. However there's no massive twist. Nothing is really explained and all of it is really unnecessary. It just ends.I developed no emotional attachment to any of the characters. The story arc is stupid, the acts the lead character accomplish are unbelievable and his part in the story was unimportant. (They would have gone anyway, found the ship, blown it up and the unexplained thing that was going to kill us all would have been stopped)It is beyond me how it's rated so high and if anyone can explain what I missed or how this is actually a good film I'm willing to hear it."
Ad Astra,20-Sep-19,"Its basically a story of Brad Pitt having daddy and abandonment issues and issues with relationships in general, which happens to be set in space.If that's what floats your boat, go for it. I hated it."
Ad Astra,20-Sep-19,"-Moon Bandits!
-Crazed space monkeys!
-Manhole in the Martian desert
-Martian recording studio.
-Stowaway in a rocket engine cowling.
-Slingshot through Neptune's rings!?
-Star Trek has more believable physicsThis movie is ridiculous."
Ad Astra,18-Sep-19,The plot is completely ludicrous nonsense. None of the characters were developed enough for me to care. Brad Pitt is so boring in it! The science is all completely wrong. Visually it looked decent in parts (I watched in Imax) but it's mind numbingly boring and so insulting I was ready to leave after 1 hour. My wife said we should stay till the end but that proved to be a mistake. There are countless things wrong with this movie. I honestly wouldn't waste your time
Ad Astra,19-Sep-19,"Well, I hate to break out the news to you all but...Ad Astra is actually not a sci-fi film at all. It's rather more of a drama-adventure.
Even though it's set in deep space with beautiful background scenery, the true essence of the film is quite simplistic, yet very profound.Ad Astra is a man's ( sad inner child ) personal story ( first-person narrative ) about unresolved issues due to his father's abandonment at an early age and his ultimate journey ( across the universe ) to seek ""closure"" and amends with him in order to fulfill a normal life and healthy relationships with the people around him.
That's what this film is really all about.It's not about saving the world, or about quantum or astrophysics.. It's about how we take things for granted in our lives'.. it's about how we seem to think that there has to be something better 'out there' when it reality the best things in life are right here under our noses. It's about making family our first priority over everything else in life and the severe long-term and unforgiving consequences for not doing so.Towards the final scenes of the film, James Gray conveys this message to us very clearly. The protagonist's father chose to dedicate his entire lifetime to seek out new civilizations on far away planets. He discovered nothing- just barren planets with ""no love or hate"".. when in fact everything that really mattered in his life was right there on Planet Earth and there was no way for him to turn back time and find his way back. The damage was already done. He inevitably paid a dear price for choosing to abandon his wife & son...How many of us work like dogs all day and spend very little time with our loved ones... Everything in life comes with a price tag. The protagonist realized towards the end of his quest that he was doomed to carry on exactly in his father's footsteps unless he made certain changes in his life.. This is the underlined meaning of the film. It made me think a lot about how life is short and fragile, and about what really matters..."
Ad Astra,19-Sep-19,"I'm a big fan of Sci-fi movies, when they actually make sense...
As visually impressive as it might be at times, Ad Astra tries to be a psychological drama set in space. Only that it fails as a psychological drama and it's almost an insult to the space Sci-fi genre.You clearly see a movie failing when a grandiose or highly abstract topic revolves around the personal stories of a character or two, it makes it feel ""cheap"" or sloppy (yes, I'm thinking Interstellar also). If you place the main story in any other setting, some details change but the main idea can be left untouched, so is this a Sci-fi movie? Is this a space movie? And if it's not, why is it wrapped up like one?As some reviews describe, the main story is unconvincing at best, with a very sloppy script. Decisions feel forced for the sake of suspense, the journey totally predictable, there is no depth in the character construction.
However the worse part, which I consider almost an insult to the genre, is the message that can be read between the lines: ""believe and do not question"". It's almost like a bored priest in the Vatican decided to sabotage a Sci-fi movie.
I gave this a bit of thought and I can't remember any other Sci-fi movie being as anti-Sci-fi as this one.It gets 3 stars for the visuals and Brad Pitt's effort, but it could have (should have) been so so so much better!"
Ad Astra,20-Sep-19,"If you have trouble sleeping, watch this movie. The slow and boring storyline will put you to sleep."
Ad Astra,21-Sep-19,"Movie was just a drama flick....with so many unnecessary plots.
OK!!!.... So its space drama but at least get some science behind it. You don't fly around space with shield in ur hand like super hero... Overall terrible!!!!"
Ad Astra,19-Sep-19,"Where do I begin?Not an action movie although many action scenes. Not a psychological thriller although many attempted ""deep and philosophical"" monologues and constant ""psychological"" assessments. A family adventure? Ha!This, similar to Gravity, is a cinematographic delight wrapped in an awful plot, terrible script, some really jarring technical flaws (to be discussed later) and some totally ridiculous scenes that were thrown in as an afterthought to try keep us from falling asleep at Brad's constant monotonic narration about nothing.The ridiculous scenes:
* Raging space baboons
* Space pirates hell bent on destruction but without reason
* A military convoy of buggies with only a few hand guns in a known Warzone
* The crazed father hellbent on staying but leaves without a whisper
* Giant neon Marlboro Man visible only to space pirates...
* Rockets land in one place and take off in another in the middle of nowhere
* Underwater tunnels in the middle of nowhere that lead to the rocket
*Brad sneaks through said tunnel to climb aboard said rocket during launch... OMG
The list is endless..The technical flaws:
* A sky high Tower within the Earth's gravitational field built from Meccano sets of infinite strength
* Brad happens to be wearing a parachute with his spacesuit
* Astronauts who playfully release liquids in zero gravity amongst life critical electronic equipment
* Brad never grows a beard or hair in 79 days of space travel on the way there but grows just a bit on the way back
* Cosmic waves that increase in power the further from the source
* The source is a massive unexplained disc on the side spaceship. What was that built for?
* Brad's all environments self repairing light material spacesuit
* Dozens of cheap plastic Casio calculators stuck willy nilly on every bit of equipment
* Airlocks, or should I say none..
* Climbs aboard a rocket 2 seconds before launch and survives the g-forces just standing inside the door
And the list goes onSome fantastic cinematography. Truly worth seeing in IMAX as I did. You can almost understand why Flat Earthers believe everything is fake as the imagery is so real! Amazing.But...Overall, a mess of a movie!"
Ad Astra,21-Sep-19,"Rating 2.5/10
""Let me go Roy .. Dad"" I've waited a long time for an Ad Astra. Unfortunetly it turned out not to be worth it. I tought this movie much better than First Man, but i was wrong. Honestly, this movie really badly mad, has no entertainment value and gives no feeling at all. Very disappointed as this could have been better. It is just painful."
Ad Astra,19-Sep-19,"I went to see Ad Asta yesterday evening. After the superb images in Gravity or Interstellar, I was curious to see what 2019 brings.
I wasn't disappointed, the movie is very well shot, the Space images are well made, deep sky, the Planets, the Moon, really nice.However, I think the movie was ruined by its screenplay which lacks of coherence. The story is really weak and undeveloped. There are many fractures in the reality of space travelling,You almost have the feeling that the screenplay was written to have a support for the images, nothing more.So yeah, I give this movie a 6 and I'm sad to see how a possible epic movie is ruined by a weak screenplay."
Ad Astra,19-Sep-19,"It's a very bad movie. I don't know why it is rated so high. Firstly, it's a space opera but the character development and exposition and is sub-par at best. The motivations and behaviors of the characters are absurd. Don't even get me started on the scientific explanations. It is a big budget movie. They could have hired someone to make legitimate explanations. It's just massively insulting that they didn't even try. Story is just not good.The visuals are beautiful and the VFX look good but honestly, they could be so much better. Looks like the director intentionally didn't want the movie to be about the visuals but rather about the characters. But the characters are uninteresting and not developed well. It's just disappointing. There is one action scene. A space fight on the moon in lunar buggies. Yet, even THAT, an space fight on lunar surface, is boring and very uninteresting."
Ad Astra,19-Sep-19,"A completely pedestrian journey AWAY from SOL - A string of skits along the way from Earth to Moon then Mars and Neptune. Devoid of technology that could have made the progress more believable eg Space Elevators and Lunar Electromagnetic payload propulsion.The special effects, costume and set designs were perfectly executed but this can not hide the fact it seems was written by someone with no actual enthusiasm or technical background for the subject. It is 51 years since 2001: A Space Odyssey yet the only progress in film production since then is a better rendered lunar rover experience. The great visuals are the slight of hand to cover a weak story. This is not The Expanse you might be expecting.When you run out of ideas plucked from the obvious in the genre; 2001, THX1138, Genesis II, Total Recall, Event Horizon, mix in some baboons from Wizard of Oz and an uderwater scene from Trainspotting?. Try and make it critically credible by reworking the ending from Gravity and convince viewers it was all a journey about humanity, depression and relationships.Last week I saw Apollo 11 and spent the first 30 minutes fighting back tears. Halfway through Ad Astra and I was closing one eye in hope my brain would view something half interesting.I can only feel this was rated highly by people with no actual life or film experience ie. born this century."
Ad Astra,15-Jun-20,"'Ad Astra' was a film I knew nothing about going in, and i'm glad I went in blind. It was visually gorgeous with nail biting set pieces, but the story hit me in just the right spot. It takes a good script for you to hear voice over in lieu of dialogue and not feel like you're being cheated, and this script was, in my mind, excellent. It's a vibe-y film that spends a lot of time in silence, and if you're like me you'll really appreciate the time it takes to develop the emotional and visual severity. On its surface it's a space epic, but in its heart it will speak to victims of depression, as well as anyone who's ever spent years feeling like they didn't belong. It takes a journey greater than most are wiling to take to find your deepest demons and confront them. Absolutely loved it."
Ad Astra,21-Sep-19,"Visually, well done. Technology and cinematography have blended into creating art with limitless capabilities and beauty, however.......the producers must think their audience are imbociles that will swallow any garbage that is thrown at them as they unshamefully take your time money after they con you with the trailers and star power. Empty & shallow plot and storyline. Kindergarten level science and physics. Unbelievable scenarios. I was truly rooting for everyone to die and the earth to explode.
Did they not watch the final product or test screen?"
Ad Astra,20-Sep-19,"Just finished watching the movie feel like one of the most boring movie of the year, I feel if someone is suffering from sleeplessness they should better watch this movie instead of take sleeping pills.Bad script, Bad direction and what a bad ending.This is one of the worst space movie of all time."
Ad Astra,17-Sep-19,"Disclaimer: Ad Astra is a masterful psychological drama disguised as a gorgeous sci-fi epic. This is not the next popcorn space adventure flick some were desperately waiting for. In fact, it is way more than that.Driven by some of the greatest acting Brad Pitt has ever produced, James Gray's most ambitious film to date is a total treat for the eyes. Here, cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema is reaching new heights of creativity in his artistic vision, which easily differentiates his present work from the likes of Interstellar (especially those scenes with Ruth Negga are spectacular). Special reference must be made to the beautifully generated special effects, which really make this movie a contender for the most realistic depiction of space (as Gray himself had in mind). Camera doesn't shy away from taking a closer look at its protagonist, using angles that elevate every aspect of his skillfuly understated performance. As the story moves deeper in space (and Roy plunges deeper into the hidden wounds of his psyche), Pitt's exceptionally well-executed facial expressions, eye movements and mannerisms reveal fragments of instability to an almost frightening extent, given how much of a calculated, calm and disciplined person the leading character seemed to be on the outside. You can virtually see Roy's deconstruction and recontruction throughout this epic journey into the abyss (of outer space and human soul).Questions are raised, and answers are not always easy to digest. A life devoted to achieving a ""greater"" professional/scientific (but not necessarily noble) goal can lead to alienation and eventually abstaining from life itself. And it's not like it's always a rewarding journey. It often just leaves behind severely traumatized souls, as Gray's depressive, introspective space drama depicts in the most touching way.If there are any negatives to be pointed out: Perhaps a little too many references to Apocalypse Now (at least I found them a bit distracting).p.s.: Many haters will desperately try to discredit this film. The easiest path is to rant about the screenplay and overly focus on supposed ""plot holes"", taking the plot at face value despite the movie's metaphorical approach. Sadly, they are missing the main themes along with every point it tries to make. It's actually very absurd, since most of the scepticists are obviously fans of Interstellar, whose ending is a plot hole the size of a... black hole! Don't let these hateful attacks distort the experience of this thrilling journey into the soul."
Ad Astra,25-Sep-19,"Let me start off by saying that the movie's pacing is unusual (think of the pacing of Interstellar; constant progress), but unlike Interstellar, this movie's climax is not as strong- but that's not a bad thing.The whole movie is about how Brad Pitt is calm on the outside, but inside he is a storm of feelings. This can be a metaphor for space itself- always quiet, but is very complex inside.The end of the movie (without spoiling it) also works with that logic- there is no loud Inception horn, in fact, seemingly it's pretty relaxed, but you can still sense the tension and emotions going on.Now that's what I call ""show don't tell"""
Ad Astra,19-Sep-19,"It seems like James Gray is the man of one movie and has nothing left to say outside of the Russian community of New York. Like the lost city of Z, Ad astra is intensely boring. There is no rhythm at all in the succession of pointless events. At no moment we feel remotely concerned about what is happening. No character building, no tension, ridiculous inconsistencies, not even great images of space. A total an absolute failure"
Ad Astra,22-Sep-19,"I was hoping to really like this but the plot, dialogue, and overall storyline for Ad Astra were at best, mediocre. The film was over-cast. I was fooled by big movie production folks. Brad, why did you allow this to happen to us?"
Ad Astra,03-Jul-20,"So, reading reviews is not always the best thing to do. Sure, the movie is not fast nor continuously sensational, but it really is a solid slow burner. A powerful story that asks the right questions and gives beautiful answers. An intelligent movie you might say. Great acting too. It reminded me a bit of Apocalypse Now, where a fallen hero/monster needs to be stopped and the protagonist, while taking on the quest, finds himself on a journey of personal growth. Sure, the science is probably ridiculous at times, but so it is in Star Wars. If you can get past that it is definitely worth your time. Enjoy."
Extraction,24-Apr-20,Finally Netflix has finally produced a action movie that is fast pace. Chris Hemsworth does not disappoint at all.
Extraction,24-Apr-20,"The action scenes are really good. Close combat with extremely long shots in tight spaces. Sometimes it has a shooter video game feel to it. Hemsworth and the stunt team really showed of their skills. This movie is really more about close combat scenes, than crazy Hollywood stunts a la mission Impossible. Other than that, all the story is already in the title, which is fine for this type of movie. The actor, who played the boy was a wonderful casting choice. He was carrying the whole emotion of story. We'll be seeing more of him. Other characters were not drawn out. This movie is not for everyone, it is not well rounded, it's all action and no story. I personally enjoyed it though. I recommend this for viewers that like close combat action and martial arts movies."
Extraction,26-Apr-20,"""Extraction"" is fast, vicious and simple. With a death count that's approaching John Wick 3 levels of bullet ballet, the movie hardly pauses for breath.Chris Hemsworth is excellent as the haunted mercenary Tyler Rake. This is a very physical role and Hemsworth delivers in spades.8 out of 10."
Extraction,28-May-20,"Tyler Rake (Chris Hemsworth) is tasked with extracting the son of a druglord amids an all-out drug war. Battling hostiles and a troubled past along the way.Thank you Jon Wick for upping the game for action films! Extraction excels in its action set pieces. Long, gorgeous takes with brutally grounded fight scenes, showcase the vicious nature of warfare. Hemsworth carries this entire film on his shoulders and has the daunting task of elevating the paper thin narrative to an acceptable level. Thankfully, he succeeds. Thor can act darn it, and in this film he proves it yet again.Like Jon Wick before him, seeing Hemsworth kicking ass in amazingly choreographed fight scenes, is exhilarating. The film is unapologetically honest in its depiction of violence and its consequences. Riding on fantastic sound design, every impact, bullet wound and car crash pulls you in deeper and deeper in the film."
Extraction,10-May-20,"Negative reviews have focused on the alleged shortfall in the depth of the plot. Really? Most action movies out there... how many have a plausible plot? At least for this movie, the plot is plausible, the action, obviously a stretch. But those critics railing on the movie forget what a movie is supposed to be all about. Entertainment. It's not a real life documentary, not an ensemble boring drama piece. When it comes to wham-bang entertainment, this movie delivers on all cylinders. The movie is probably more analogous to a version of masterful The Raid than an Oscar drama piece. Live with it. Watch it. Enjoy. It is a movie. It will keep you glued. Though the squeamish may need to take a break."
Extraction,25-Apr-20,"I'm not much of a writer, so I'll keep the review short.The plot is nothing new, but is interesting enough. However, Chris Hemsworth knocks it out the park with his performance - I really didn't expect that from him, but he is awesome in this.The action scenes are great, and some of the camera work and filming techniques are fantastic.The film is a 6/10, but I gave it a 7/10 for the action scenes and Hemsworth's performance."
Extraction,24-Apr-20,"In a world that is currently minus new films, to get a fresh one delivered to us via Netflix was a much needed treat. And I'm glad to report that 'Extraction' was worth the wait. It isn't a flawless movie, but it certainly has some good things going for it. The action sequences were probably the highlight of the film for me. I'm not usually someone who appreciates or even notices good action sequences, but I did with this film which says something. There is one sequence that really blew me away. It is a one-shot sequence that goes on for quite some time and has some amazing ingenuity behind it. Definitely the highlight of the film.Chris Hemsworth was right at home in this role. He doesn't have to do a lot of speaking, and can just let his actions speak for themselves. Some of the stunt work in this film would not have been easy. When he is required to slow things down and have some dialogue in the odd scene he does so adequately.The film surprised me with just how violent it was willing to be at times, especially in scenes involving children. There were a couple of time where I thought - they're not going to do that are they? - and then sure enough they did. This is a very serious film as well. Very little (if any that I can think of) humour whatsoever makes an appearance.The film does get a little tedious towards the end. You can only watch so many people getting shot without becoming numb and a little bored by it. Also the film opens with a shot from near the end of the film. It doesn't work though because there is no intrigue behind it. This was one of the few poor choices an otherwise very good film made however. I would recommend giving this one a watch."
Extraction,26-Apr-20,"The entire movie is filled with close combat shots. It's great for someone who likes a lot of actions but for someone like who looks for a story in movies, I had a hard time trying to grasp this movie.
It literally shows a poor country like Bangladesh lost thousands of its elite force, a general and dispersed an entire city just to support a gangster and save his kidnapped boy from escaping. Looks like Bangladesh went into an entire war to help the gangster no matter what.
Just leave that logic aside and you can enjoy the movie as a fast paced, action packed video game."
Extraction,26-Apr-20,"I am Bangladeshi. But I know this movie was not made with our culture. But Hindi songs go from house to house in Bangladesh! What an awkward thing! Then writing Hindi on the street, Hindi pronunciation in every word, what are these? Learning from Kolkata, if Dhaka is named, then this is the situation! The job of a director and team is to check and select well. They have lost completely. But the actions of this movie were extraordinary. chris and randeep have done a great job.I know an action movie doesn't represent culture, but the movie is criticized for its lack of analysis by the director and the team. A little better analysis was needed, because here the names of the russo brothers are involved. And i love russo brothers and chris my thor so much...."
Extraction,25-Apr-20,"Impressive camera work and action sequence. All the actors did a great job in making this film very entertaining. The fight scenes are great, the knife fights are authentic and the shoot out was exhilarating. I guess my only critic on this is the plot perhaps a different twist about who the boy was would have made it more interesting but nevertheless an awesome action film overall. Again hats off to the camera work, fantastic job!"
Extraction,25-Apr-20,"Now, it's not a greate movie nor is it a bad movie, it's somewhere in between. I mean the stunt work is really, really great, and the protagonist does have his moments of weakness, and it has that kind of action you come to expect from action movies today (one man against the whole world) but i bet that there was someone working on that movie that had millitary expirience.. One of rare movies in which the guy actually checks to see if the gun has bullets when he steals it, actually counting bullets in a magazine or having an empty gun or chamber...
Yes the movie has poor CGI, too much yellow color grading and unrealistic shooting and fighting scenes but it still has it's moments of actual care for the character even though it's not as developed."
Extraction,15-May-20,"Thoroughly enjoyed this film - weak storyline but it's totally forgiven because of its brilliant action and the camera work on it is a thing of beauty.
you're glued to the car chases and fights to the point where you feel you should be smelling the exhaust fumes and that if you don't dodge out the way you're going to get a smack in the mouth or shot.
The Director could do a James Bond film no problem.
it's got the rawness of action that's needed"
Extraction,04-May-20,"Had expectations aft seeing the trailer but it all fizzled once the movie started playing.
It has a ridiculous story, tension n character development is nada.
I am totally surprised that inspite of this film being backed by Netflix, with amazing star cast, it lacked the substance.
The hand to hand combat with the knife is not thrilling. For the real deal (silat fighting) check out The Raid Redemption.
As a fan of Randeep Hooda, I am happy that he got a good role.
The babe is attractive.
The hint near the swimming pool at the end is again a big meh with the possible of a sequel.
Now that will be too much for a guy to survive with bullets pierced all over."
Extraction,24-Apr-20,"Just a good solid action flick, Hemsworth does a great job, and well directed.Want to play a drinking game that'll get you wasted fast? Read through the user reviews and do a shot every time some Bangladeshi leaves a one star review and cries about the portrayal of their Country. (I've been there, the movie is flattering if anything)"
Extraction,24-Apr-20,"You are looking for gun fight action movie ,just go for it."
Extraction,24-Apr-20,"The premise of the movie was supposed to set in Dhaka, a city of 10+ million people in Bangladesh. Unfortunately, they completely missed mark making the set in Dhaka.To start with, the accent of the locals are wrong, they are speaking in an accent that's commonly used in West Bengal, India. Dhaka and People in Bangladesh, in General, have a completely different accent. Throughout the movie, Hindi songs are heard in the background, where everyone is watching tv during midday. People go to work here, Dhaka is the capital, nobody sits on their asses watching TV midday. Bangladesh has its own music industry, although the movie had some issues acquiring copyright for some of the songs to play in the background.The environment is wrong. Sure Dhaka has slums and dirty places, but most of the city is developed enough with an actual nice road system. If they set the scene somewhere else in Bangladesh, it would've been more convincing. The roads are basically dirt roads in this movie where Dhaka has one of the best road systems in the Country. Dhaka doesn't have that kinda dense jungle anywhere near the city, certainly not near the Buriganga river.The criminal class in Bangladesh is completely different. This isn't Africa, people don't employ child soldiers here. And certainly carry Ak-47 in hand and in the open.The Police uniform and looks are completely misjudged. They are trying to portray the elite force of Bangladesh, Known as Rapid Action Battalion. They are not regular police. The deal with counter-terrorism and similar stuff. It should've been the police that deals with criminal or action in the street. Police vehicles are wrong.Don't get me wrong, the entire movie is brilliantly shot and exceptionally action-packed. But this provides a complete misrepresentation of Bangladesh, as well as the city of Dhaka. People who don't have an idea about Bangladesh will get a false sense for a beautiful country by the misrepresented set of this movie."
Extraction,04-May-20,"Wow shocked at the undeserving low score! This is stunt actor Sam Hargrave's first full length feature film sitting in the directors chair, and he nailed it. Outstanding action/fight choreography, great cinematography, perfect pacing for the 116 min runtime, and all around great performances, especially Hemsworth's kick-ass character. I'm reading the reviews about no plot... seriously? Just because there's no surprising unpredictable plot twist doesn't mean there's no plot. It was a simple story, adapted into a screenplay from the graphic novel by Ande Parks, and presented on a bullet ridden testosterone plate. What more does anyone want for that perfect weekend popcorn action flick? I thoroughly enjoyed it! It's a well deserved 9/10 from me. To see more of my over 900 reviews and 1000+ ratings, click on my username."
Extraction,24-Apr-20,"The latest Netflix original film to arrive on the streaming service. Extraction sees Tyler Rake (Chris Hemsworth), a black market mercenary, embark on the most deadly extraction of his career when he's enlisted to rescue the kidnapped son (Rudhraksh Jaiswal) of an imprisoned international crime lord.As much as their originals are hit and miss and the sheer amount of content they release being ridiculous, there is no question that Netflix allow pure filmmaker freedom without the restrictions and interference of Hollywood influence as here the film is allowed to make full use of its 18 rating and not have the burden of setting up or continuing a franchise. Though generic and cliche in its story telling, the action and stunt work are an absolute blast to witness and make this a step up from what I was expecting.The film's 2 hour runtime may have some filler sequences around the middle section, but the 1st and 3rd acts are fast paced and frantic, throwing you right into the situation, the film knows exactly what it wants and sets out to deliver it. The race against time and constant improvisation of the extraction itself makes for a consistently engaging watch, though the film does brush over motivations (the villain here is especially lacklustre) and character back story, with Tyler solely relying on a few flashbacks and essentially an exposition interview with the kid he is protecting, so that we get more of his story.However what this basic premise does allow for is to be filled with brutal, well choreographed and creative action. This film delivers one of the best set pieces of this year, with a phenomenal one-take style 15 minute sequence, which goes from a car chase, to a building assault to a lorry chase, it's absolute controlled chaos. As a fan of John Wick, The Raid etc. it was excellent to see their influence on the choreography, the camerawork never is too shaky or quick cutting meaning it is easy to follow and witness every stab, punch, kick in their bone crunching and visceral glory. The shootouts sound great and are intense, always ending in bloody results, especially the finale sequence.It's good seeing Hemsworth in a grittier, darker non-Thor/MIB role and he delivers here in a more somber and focused role, though also channels some of the action hero vibe of the 80/90's that this film is going for. Jaiswal is also good here as the kid thrown into this life or death situation, he is never irritating or acts unrealistically at all (which is the case with kids in these types of films at times). Randeep Hooda has an intimidating screen presence as someone working for the kid's father and David Harbour gives an enthusiastic performance, though his character's section does stall the plot pacing.Extraction is a fun watch to turn your brain off for 2 hours and was actually better than I expected. The action is bloody, visceral and frantic with some brilliant practical effects and choreography and the cast give good performances. The film does suffer from several cliches and genre traits and lack of character depth, but honestly from a purely entertainment perspective this does the job."
Extraction,24-Apr-20,I think that people from Bangladesh are taking this way too personally. I mean this is not a tourist video for your beloved country but rather a balls-to-the-wall action movie. The only reason they are bitter is because India had a lot to do with the movie. So an honest review is that yes this is action packed with some great hand to hand combat scenes and gun fights...it is however lacking plot. Chris Hemsworth is great and his supporting cast are excellent as well.
Extraction,24-Apr-20,"I don't care how it portrayed Dhaka. It was a great action thriller. Plot is not anything serious or unique, but actions are great really."
Extraction,24-Apr-20,"Well good action. Not that close representation of Dhaka, more of an Indian gimic. Hating the Indian accent, Bangladeshi doesn't have that accent.
Chris did well, story cud have been much more.
None the less good to see Dhaka in international names, tho it was negative.
Chris was the only good actor that i actually found, the kid speaks irritatingly slow and doesn't seem to gave the right face for the scene. Better cast wud have been better along with Chris."
Extraction,24-Apr-20,"Good close quarter combats but a plot would have been nice.
Recommended if you're stuck in quarantine and have nothing better to do with your life like me."
Extraction,24-Apr-20,How on earth a movie of this level have literally portraying no motive of kidnapping at all. Chris did his best !
Extraction,25-Apr-20,"First of all this movie is for entertainment so don't give negative comments on the basis of bangladeshi image.
Its a fun action ride so enjoy and don't miss this flick.
This netflix movie is mindblowing and interesting,i will mention both positive and negative points of this movie:-
Positive:-
1). Action and fight sequences
2). Acting and performance by both actors Chris n Randeep.
3). Screenplay
4). Direction
5). Fast StorylineNegative-
1)- Plot(because only one thing i can't understand that how army of an country work under a drug lord and lock down capital on the order of drug lord?)But overall movie is worth watching and don't think about negative comments because its just a one sided."
Extraction,28-Apr-20,"Some solid acting all around. Great combat scenes, mostly one on ones, Why kidnap the kid when father is in prison? But who needs a solid story when you have action scenes galore! Great city scenes!"
The Shawshank Redemption,24-Jul-10,"The Shawshank Redemption is written and directed by Frank Darabont. It is an adaptation of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, the film portrays the story of Andy Dufresne (Robbins), a banker who is sentenced to two life sentences at Shawshank State Prison for apparently murdering his wife and her lover. Andy finds it tough going but finds solace in the friendship he forms with fellow inmate Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Freeman). While things start to pick up when the warden finds Andy a prison job more befitting his talents as a banker. However, the arrival of another inmate is going to vastly change things for all of them.There was no fanfare or bunting put out for the release of the film back in 94, with a title that didn't give much inkling to anyone about what it was about, and with Columbia Pictures unsure how to market it, Shawshank Redemption barely registered at the box office. However, come Academy Award time the film received several nominations, and although it won none, it stirred up interest in the film for its home entertainment release. The rest, as they say, is history. For the film finally found an audience that saw the film propelled to almost mythical proportions as an endearing modern day classic. Something that has delighted its fans, whilst simultaneously baffling its detractors. One thing is for sure, though, is that which ever side of the Shawshank fence you sit on, the film continues to gather new fans and simply will never go away or loose that mythical status.It's possibly the simplicity of it all that sends some haters of the film into cinematic spasms. The implausible plot and an apparent sentimental edge that makes a nonsense of prison life, are but two chief complaints from those that dislike the film with a passion. Yet when characters are this richly drawn, and so movingly performed, it strikes me as churlish to do down a human drama that's dealing in hope, friendship and faith. The sentimental aspect is indeed there, but that acts as a counterpoint to the suffering, degradation and shattering of the soul involving our protagonist. Cosy prison life you say? No chance. The need for human connection is never more needed than during incarceration, surely? And given the quite terrific performances of Robbins (never better) & Freeman (sublimely making it easy), it's the easiest thing in the world to warm to Andy and Red.Those in support aren't faring too bad either. Bob Gunton is coiled spring smarm as Warden Norton, James Whitmore is heart achingly great as the ""Birdman Of Shawshank,"" Clancy Brown is menacing as antagonist Capt. Byron Hadley, William Sadler amusing as Heywood & Mark Rolston is impressively vile as Bogs Diamond. Then there's Roger Deakins' lush cinematography as the camera gracefully glides in and out of the prison offering almost ethereal hope to our characters (yes, they are ours). The music pings in conjunction with the emotional flow of the movie too. Thomas Newman's score is mostly piano based, dovetailing neatly with Andy's state of mind, while the excellently selected soundtrack ranges from the likes of Hank Williams to the gorgeous Le Nozze di Figaro by Mozart.If you love Shawshank then it's a love that lasts a lifetime. Every viewing brings the same array of emotions - anger - revilement - happiness - sadness - inspiration and a warmth that can reduce the most hardened into misty eyed wonderment. Above all else, though, Shawshank offers hope - not just for characters in a movie - but for a better life and a better world for all of us. 10/10"
The Shawshank Redemption,26-Nov-03,"Why do I want to write the 234th comment on The Shawshank Redemption? I am not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been said. But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption. The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, ""Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better."" At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing.No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other.The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul."
The Shawshank Redemption,10-Feb-06,"In its Oscar year, Shawshank Redemption (written and directed by Frank Darabont, after the novella Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, by Stephen King) was nominated for seven Academy Awards, and walked away with zero. Best Picture went to Forrest Gump, while Shawshank and Pulp Fiction were ""just happy to be nominated."" Of course hindsight is 20/20, but while history looks back on Gump as a good film, Pulp and Redemption are remembered as some of the all-time best. Pulp, however, was a success from the word ""go,"" making a huge splash at Cannes and making its writer-director an American master after only two films. For Andy Dufresne and Co., success didn't come easy. Fortunately, failure wasn't a life sentence.After opening on 33 screens with take of $727,327, the $25M film fell fast from theatres and finished with a mere $28.3M. The reasons for failure are many. Firstly, the title is a clunker. While iconic to fans today, in 1994, people knew not and cared not what a 'Shawshank' was. On the DVD, Tim Robbins laughs recounting fans congratulating him on ""that 'Rickshaw' movie."" Marketing-wise, the film's a nightmare, as 'prison drama' is a tough sell to women, and the story of love between two best friends doesn't spell winner to men. Worst of all, the movie is slow as molasses. As Desson Thomson writes for the Washington Post, ""it wanders down subplots at every opportunity and ignores an abundance of narrative exit points before settling on its finale."" But it is these same weaknesses that make the film so strong.Firstly, its setting. The opening aerial shots of the prison are a total eye-opener. This is an amazing piece of architecture, strong and Gothic in design. Immediately, the prison becomes a character. It casts its shadow over most of the film, its tall stone walls stretching above every shot. It towers over the men it contains, blotting out all memories of the outside world. Only Andy (Robbins) holds onto hope. It's in music, it's in the sandy beaches of Zihuatanejo; ""In here's where you need it most,"" he says. ""You need it so you don't forget. Forget that there are places in the world that aren't made out of stone. That there's a - there's a - there's something inside that's yours, that they can't touch."" Red (Morgan Freeman) doesn't think much of Andy at first, picking ""that tall glass o' milk with the silver spoon up his ass"" as the first new fish to crack. Andy says not a word, and losing his bet, Red resents him for it. But over time, as the two get to know each other, they quickly become the best of friends. This again, is one of the film's major strengths. Many movies are about love, many flicks have a side-kick to the hero, but Shawshank is the only one I can think of that looks honestly at the love between two best friends. It seems odd that Hollywood would skip this relationship time and again, when it's a feeling that weighs so much into everyone's day to day lives. Perhaps it's too sentimental to seem conventional, but Shawshank's core friendship hits all the right notes, and the film is much better for it.It's pacing is deliberate as well. As we spend the film watching the same actors, it is easy to forget that the movie's timeline spans well over 20 years. Such a huge measure of time would pass slowly in reality, and would only be amplified in prison. And it's not as if the film lacks interest in these moments. It still knows where it's going, it merely intends on taking its sweet time getting there. It pays off as well, as the tedium of prison life makes the climax that much more exhilarating. For anyone who sees it, it is a moment never to be forgotten.With themes of faith and hope, there is a definite religious subtext to be found here. Quiet, selfless and carefree, Andy is an obvious Christ figure. Warden Norton (Bob Gunton) is obviously modeled on Richard Nixon, who, in his day, was as close to a personified Satan as they come. But if you aren't looking for subtexts, the movie speaks to anyone in search of hope. It is a compelling drama, and a very moving film, perfectly written, acted and shot. They just don't come much better than this.OVERALL SCORE: 9.8/10 = A+ The Shawshank Redemption served as a message of hope to Hollywood as well. More than any film in memory, it proved there is life after box office. Besting Forrest and Fiction, it ran solely on strong word of mouth and became the hottest rented film of 1995. It currently sits at #2 in the IMDb's Top 250 Films, occasionally swapping spots with The Godfather as the top ranked film of all time -- redemption indeed. If you haven't seen it yet, what the hell are you waiting for? As Andy says, ""It comes down a simple choice, really. Either get busy living, or get busy dying."""
The Shawshank Redemption,21-Nov-05,"I'm trying to save you money; this is the last film title that you should consider borrowing. Renting Shawshank will cost you five bucks... just plunk down the $25 and own the title. You'll wind up going back to this gem time and time again. This is one of few movies that are truly timeless. And it's entertaining and moving, no matter how many times you view it.Forget about what others (including myself) might suggest you'll discover in ""The Shawshank Redemption;"" when you watch it, you'll identify something very personal in your own life with a scene, a character, or a moment in this uncomplicated movie. When you need hope, you'll look for Shawshank. When you want to believe in the will of overcoming even the greatest obstacles, Shawshank will uplift you in ways that you can't find in movies today. Some liken the film to some kind of spiritual awakening. Of course, some can go to a church or mosque to find enlightenment and Faith in humanity, but most places of worship are open only certain days or times. But when you need affirmation of the lasting bond of friendships that prevail over the most dire circumstances, Shawshank will give it to you. It makes grown men (like me) cry, still. I wonder whether Shawshank was truly meant for viewing in the privacy of the home, because it is a personal experience that really makes you look inward. Nominated for seven, this is the best film that never one a single Oscar. How ironic that an innocent man winds up being surrounded by the corruption of the legal system. Shawshank itself is similar to the character of Andy Dufresne. Prejudging this classic film, critics couldn't get past the title. The public followed suit, initially dismissing Shawshank, which failed in the box office just like ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and ""Citizen Kane."" It could have just whithered away on the store shelves, like Andy Dufresne could have in his own cell. But the characters prevailed, because Andy -- And Shawshank -- stayed true. Now, these movies are right up there as the most popular films of all time. Anyone who has yet to watch Shawshank may be so jaded of movies, or the film's title, or how a 2-1/2- hour movie set inside the walls of a prison can manage to tap the soul of such a wide range of people. Shawshank has not one explosion. I wonder if it even has a single special effect or digitally- enhanced frame. But every aspect of Shawshank fit together. The acting from the top to the bit part. The musical score. The editing. The photography. The story, from opening credits to final scene. All involved, including the town of Mansfield, Ohio (where Shawshank was actually filmed) played their roles perfectly. Shawshank is a must- see, must- own title."
The Shawshank Redemption,08-Feb-01,"I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams.  And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope.  Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message.  Frank Darabont didn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love this film, the narration and the acting does that for him.  Why this movie didn't win all seven Oscars is beyond me, but don't let that sway you to not see this film, let its ranking on the IMDb's top 250 list sway you, let your friends recommendation about the movie sway you.Set aside a little over two hours tonight and rent this movie.  You will finally understand what everyone is talking about and you will understand why this is my all time favorite movie."
The Shawshank Redemption,18-Feb-08,"This movie is not your ordinary Hollywood flick. It has a great and deep message. This movie has a foundation and just kept on being built on from their and that foundation is hope.Other than just the message of this movie the acting was phenomenal. Tim Robbins gave one of the greatest performances ever. He was inspiring, intelligent and most of all positive. His performance just made me smile. Robbins plays Andy Dufresne who was wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is gets to life sentences but yet never gives up hope. In he becomes friends with Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding played by Morgan Freeman. Freeman who gives the finest performance of his career has unlike Robbins lost hope. He is in deep regret of the crime that he committed. His way of deflecting the pain away is by trying to not feel anything at all. With his friendship with Andy he learns that without our hopes and dreams we have nothing. Andy also becomes friends with the rest of Red's group. James Whitmore also gave a great performance as Brooks Halten who gets out of prison parole but in the words of Red he has been ""institutionalized"". The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. He kept this movie at a great steady pace along with the writing and great cinematography. He portrayed prison life in such a horrifying way, but not in terms of the physical pain but the stress and pain that wares mentally on the inmates, some of which deserve a second chance. Whatever you do, don't listen to the people who say this movie is overrated because this is one of the most inspiring and greatest movies ever. It has everything you could possibly want."
The Shawshank Redemption,27-Aug-02,"Can Hollywood, usually creating things for entertainment purposes only, create art?  To create something of this nature, a director must approach it in a most meticulous manner, due to the delicacy of the process.  Such a daunting task requires an extremely capable artist with an undeniable managerial capacity and an acutely developed awareness of each element of art in their films, the most prominent; music, visuals, script, and acting. These elements, each equally important, must succeed independently, yet still form a harmonious union, because this mixture determines the fate of the artist's opus.  Though already well known amongst his colleagues for his notable skills at writing and directing, Frank Darabont emerges with his feature film directorial debut, The Shawshank Redemption.  Proving himself already a master of the craft, Darabont managed to create one of the most recognizable independent releases in the history of Hollywood.  The Shawshank Redemption defines a genre, defies the odds, compels the emotions, and brings an era of artistically influential films back to Hollywood.The story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense, victimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover.  After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole.  He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him.  His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding.  Ellis, commonly referred to as Red, finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison.  Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him.  Andy proves to Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyle.By creating the film's firm foundation, the meticulously chiseled screenplay paved the way for this film's success.  Frank Darabont outdoes himself with the phenomenal adaptation of Stephen King's equally noteworthy novella, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption.  In this novella, King demonstrates that he can break free from the genre he dominates and still create a marvelous piece of modern literature.  Though the film mirrors the novella in many ways, Darabont illustrates a focused objective of improving upon the areas where the novella came up short, resulting in one of the best book to film transitions ever.While maintaining some of the poetic and moving dialogue of the novella, Darabont also proves that a film's score can generate a great deal of emotional response from its audience, as dialogue does.  He employs the cunning Thomas Newman, son of the legendary Hollywood composer, Alfred Newman.  Darabont shows recognition for the film's needs by employing Newman, who makes the gentle piano chords whisper softly to the viewer, as if a part of the scripted dialogue.  Newman lends himself to individualism and tends to drive more towards the unique in the realm of score composition.  His effort in Shawshank did not go unnoticed, as his score received an Oscar nomination in 1995.  While unique and independent, Newman's score never once intrudes on your concentration or distracts from the film.With work from vast array of talented scene designers, costume designers, composers, cinematographers, and various other Hollywood artists, the cast of The Shawshank Redemption had a strong foundation to work with.  The marvelous cast of this film will dazzle you with some of the most convincing performances you will witness in a film.  While both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman shine as Andy and Red, respectively, the true spectacle of acting lies within the plethora of amazing supporting actors who easily disappear into their roles.  Most noticeable of these, the veteran film star James Whitmore, who portrays the elderly Brooks Hatlen.  Brooks, a man incarcerated for an unmentioned crime for so long that he finds himself attached to the Shawshank and the daily life he has lead.  Each of these actors show a true dedication to their art, and a focused purpose in their motivations, creating a convincing setting that never once caters to anything unbelievable.With all of the aesthetic touches and attention to cinematic detail, the most beautiful part of the film lies within its thematic material, such as its focus on the human desires for the most abstract concepts, like hope and freedom.  These themes, which concern things the human spirit undoubtedly yearns for, seem so intricately woven into the plot that it easily draws its audience in to its story.  Though full of hardened criminals, your heart will go out to these men as they display the most basic of human emotions, and deliver some of the most quotable lines in a film to date.  Like a great novel, this film manages to succeed at greater things than simply entertaining an audience.  Darabont tells his story most masterfully, illustrating principles and inspiring his audience to think.  He leaves us a poignant film with a powerful message of hope, and redemption, something we all seek.This film manages to redeem Hollywood in the eyes of people who feared it long lost in a dark sea of clichés and predictability.  Darabont shows us that artists still work in the Hollywood studios and production facilities. These artists show their capability to produce art; real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you.  The Shawshank Redemption delivers much-needed breath of fresh air for anyone who realizes the capability of film.  It proves that masters of the craft still live on this earth, and still bless us with timeless masterpieces that we will never forget."
The Shawshank Redemption,15-Jun-18,"I've lost count of the number of times I have seen this movie, but it is more than 20. It has to be one of the best movies ever made. It made me take notice Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins like I had never noticed any actors before.I have from a very young age been a huge fan of anything Stephen King writes and had already read the short story that this movie is based on years prior to seeing this movie.Not everything Stephen King has written that gets turned into a movie comes out well, but this is as close to perfection as it gets and has everything you could ever want in a movie.Something that is outstanding is the fact that it has no real action, no special effects and no gimmicks. 99% of the movie is just men in a prison uniforms talking. Yet it absolutely hooks you almost from the beginning and has you glued to the screen to the end.For me what really makes this film one of the best is the message of eternal hope it conveys throughout. The never ever give up hope attitude of the main character so well conveyed by Tim Robbins. The ending is just spine tingling every time I see it, no matter how many times I have seen it.Brilliant, brilliant movie and a must see for everyone."
The Shawshank Redemption,13-Jul-99,"Misery and Stand By Me were the best adaptations up until this one, now you can add Shawshank to that list.This is simply one of the best films ever made and I know I am not the first to say that and I certainly won't be the last. The standing on the IMDb is a true barometer of that. #3 as of this date and I'm sure it could be number 1. So I'll just skip all the normal praise of the film because we all know how great it is. But let me perhaps add that what I find so fascinating about Shawshank is that Stephen King wrote it.King is one of the best writers in the world. Books like IT and the Castle Rock series are some of the greatest stories ever told. But his best adaptations are always done by the best directors. The Shining was brilliantly interpreted by Kubrick and of course the aforementioned Misery and Stand By Me are both by Rob Reiner. Now Frank Darabont comes onto the scene and makes arguably the best King film ever. He seems to understand what King wants to say and he conveys that beautifully. What makes this film one of the best ever made is the message it conveys. It is one of eternal hope. Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, has been sent to prison for a crime he did not commit. But he never loses hope. He never gives up his quest to become a free man again. His years of tenacity, patience and wits keep him not only sane, but it gives his mind and a spirit a will to live. This film has a different feel to it. There has never been anything like it before and I don't know if there will again.I'm not going to say any more about this film, it has already been said, but just suffice to say that I am glad that Forrest Gump won best picture in 94. I would have been equally glad if Pulp Fiction or Shawshank would have won. It is that good of a movie and one that will be appreciated for years to come."
The Shawshank Redemption,25-Mar-99,"One of the finest films made in recent years. It's a poignant story about hope. Hope gets me. That's what makes a film like this more than a movie. It tells a lesson about life. Those are the films people talk about 50 or even 100 years from you. It's also a story for freedom. Freedom from isolation, from rule, from bigotry and hate. Freeman and Robbins are majestic in their performances. Each learns from the other. Their relationship is strong and you feel that from the first moment they make contact with one another. There is also a wonderful performance from legend James Whitmore as Brooks.He shines when it is his time to go back into the world, only to find that the world grew up so fast he never even got a chance to blink. Stephen King's story is brought to the screen with great elegance and excitement. It is an extraordinary motion that people ""will"" be talking about in 50 or 100 years."
The Shawshank Redemption,16-Aug-98,"The reason I became a member of this database is because I finally  found a movie ranking that recognized the true greatness of this movie. There  is nary a word or scene out of place in the entire thing. Every element  comes together to form an exquisite story for cinema.   I believe that one reason that this movie is under-appreciated is that  people have not seen it multiple times. On first viewing it is the story of  Andy Dufresne and his struggle to maintain hope despite his circumstances.   However, this is really a movie about Red and his struggle to find  meaning and purpose. The final segment of the movie testifies to the fact that the final resolution of the story comes about only when Red is faced with the same fearful situation as Brooks. Because of Andy, Red can find a different path-the path of freedom that is lit by hope.  Who is your Andy Dufresne?"
The Shawshank Redemption,23-Feb-20,"The Shawshank Redemption has great performances, extremely well written script and story all leading to a deeply emotional climax! One of the best dramas of all time!"
The Shawshank Redemption,06-Feb-99,"Whenever I talk about this movie with my friends, I do not even refer to it by title, but rather as ""The Movie"".  When I say ""The Movie"", my friends know exactly what I'm talking about.  In fact the main reason that me and my friends don't refer to it by title is because this movie is so great, that we do not feel worthy enough to say it's name in vain! I still remember the first time I saw The Shawshank Redemption.  Some friends of mine and I went to see it at one of those ""Budget Theaters"" over the summer of 1995.  None of us really knew anything about the movie, but we had heard that it was pretty good.  So, not having any real expectations, we saw it.  When the final credits rolled and the lights came on in the theater, all of us just sat there with our jaws hanging down on the floor. I turned my head towards my friend Bob and said ""That was the greatest movie I have ever seen in my entire life!"" There's really no other way I can put it in words.  Every moment of this movie captivated me and inspired me to believe in the one true thing in life...... ""HOPE"".  This movie is sad, uplifting, inspiring, harsh, cold, funny (at the right times), jaw-dropping, and heart-warming all at the same time.  I get chills every time I watch this film and this film contains the greatest ending (which takes place over the last 30 minutes or so)in movie history!  How it all just ""comes together"" is so incredible and uplifting. I should also mention the music in this movie is nearly flawless as well, and the soundtrack is a ""must buy"" for any music fan. The only bad thing about this movie is the fact that I know I will never see a better movie, no matter how many I may see.  I've seen many movies over the past few years, many excellent films.  However, every time I walk out of the theater, I turn to my friend or family member that I saw it with and I say, ""That was a great movie, but it wasn't nearly as good as 'you know what'!""  There have been many movies over the past few years that thought would really move me or that I might one day call my ""favorite of all time"", but they've all fallen far short of ""The Shawshank Redemption"". So, if you have yet to see this movie, please run to the video store immediately.  You're guaranteed to find it in the ""employee picks"" section. And if it isn't in that section, then you should tell the employees there that there is something seriously wrong with them.  If you have seen this movie, go see it again.  If you haven't bought your own copy yet, buy one. In fact buy two, and put one in a fire-proof safe, just in case of an emergency. :o) So, you want a 1-10 rating???  I give it a 13!!!!!!"
The Shawshank Redemption,21-Oct-98,"My life is forever changed due to this movie.  It is a movie of hope, ""redemption"", and friendship.  It shows a deep growing friendship between two prisoners, Andy and Red.  They each are shown growing through their distinct hardships at Shawshank prison.  As time passes, hope wanes but a flame burns bright in Andy.  His hope and unrelentless nature carry over to his friend Red.As Red's long stay in prison comes to an end he sees the light at the end of the tunnel.  Andy has left it for him to see the way to freedom, and he follows it.This film parallels my life and leaves me wondering if my advice will help somebody see the light.  For some of those people time will tell.  As for now I'll be patient to wait and see.  Don't end up like Brooks, there will always be someone to help you out.  There is someone out there that cares for you.  Thank you Andy Dufresne, your hope is the flame of my life."
The Shawshank Redemption,06-Sep-00,"The Shawshank Redemption is without a doubt one of the most brilliant movies I have ever seen. Similar to The Green Mile in many respects (and better than it in almost all of them), these two movies have shown us that Stephen King is a master not only of horror but also of prose that shakes the soul and moves the heart. The plot is average, but King did great things with it in his novella that are only furthered by the direction, and the acting is so top-rate it's almost scary.Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufrane, wrongly imprisoned for 20 years for the murder of his wife. The story focuses on Andy's relationship with ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman, in probably his best role) and his attempts to escape from Shawshank. Bob Gunton is positively evil and frightening as Warden Norton, and there are great performances and cameos all around; the most prominent one being Gil Bellows (late as Billy of Ally McBeal) as Tommy, a fellow inmate of Andy's who suffers under the iron will of Norton.If you haven't seen this movie, GO AND RENT IT NOW. You will not be disappointed. It is positively the best movie of the '90's, and one of my Top 3 of all time. This movie is a spectacle to move the mind, soul, and heart. 10/10"
The Shawshank Redemption,25-Dec-08,"Three words: Oh. My. God.How am i supposed to describe this absolutely fantastic and unbelievable film in words? I don't know. But I'll give it a shot. Here goes.This movie is just bloody excellent, brilliant, fantastic, unbelievable, not a thing wrong with it, shocking (in a good way), heck, pretty much every single good comment word you can think of.I mean, for gods sake, its so damn good it takes your breath away! i seriously could not speak after it! it instantly took every other film i had seen under its shadow, and that's saying something, as i have seen some pretty excellent films.There's not a single actor or actress in this movie who is crap!!! standouts are Morgan freeman, Tim Robbins, and the dude who plays brooks.I could say 1239643609260246704272628xinfinity more things good about this movie, but unfortunately I haven't got that much space, and my fingers would get sore.An absolute must see for everyone, and I'm positive that ill never see another movie better than this, and this will stay at #1 on my list forever."
The Shawshank Redemption,03-Aug-01,"I believe that this film is the best story ever told on film, and I'm about to tell you why.Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufresne, a city banker, wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is sent to Shawshank Prison in 1947 and receives a double life sentence for the crime. Andy forms an unlikely friendship with ""Red"" (Morgan Freeman), the man who knows how to get things. Andy faces many trials in prison, but forms an alliance with the wardens because he is able to use his banking experience to help the corrupt officials amass personal fortunes. The story unfolds....I was so impressed with how every single subplot was given a great deal of respect and attention from the director. The acting was world-class. I have never seen Tim Robbins act as well since, Morgan Freeman maybe (e.g. Seven). The twists were unexpected, an although this film had a familiar feel, it wasn't even slightly pretentious or cliched, it was original. The cinematography was grand and expressive. It gave a real impression of the sheer magnitude of this daunting prison.But the one thing which makes THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION stand above all other films, is the attention given to the story. The film depends on the story and the way in which it unravels. It's a powerful, poignant, thought-provoking, challenging film like no other. If Andy were to comment on this film, I think he might say: ""Get busy watching, or get busy dying."" Take his advice.Thoroughly recommended."
The Shawshank Redemption,30-Nov-17,"i watch this movie for minimum 5-6 times first to last. so every time i enjoyed as i watching it first time. its a piece of art. and we now know how to entertain with no action or fighting scenes. its a pure drama that anyone can enjoy with family in silence. so i rate this movie 10 out of 10 because of amazing screen play, acting, casting, background scoring editing etc. this is my first movie review so pardon me if i did any mistake."
The Shawshank Redemption,16-Jul-13,"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a timeless story of heartbreak, deception and ultimate growth under the most deplorable conditions. The acting is superior, some of Tim Robbins' and Morgan Freeman's best work as they allow me an intimate look inside the sometimes contradictory nature of a convict's existence, where I am torn emotionally between danger and safety, light and shadow, sanity and sorrow, truth and lies, injustice and justice. In fact, I am lost in all the actors' poignant and memorable portrayals of young thugs, cruel guards, swindlers, thieves, rapists and murders, all standing in their respective spaces quietly listening together to an operatic aria over a loudspeaker on the prison yard.In this movie, I find almost no one to be all good or all bad. There are exceptions, though. Although there are those in charge of the prison I wish to be caught in a snare of their own making or worse, there are still others behind prison walls that turn out to be heroes I cheer on to win in the end. Like people in real life, most of the characters in ""The Shawshank Redemption,"" both prisoners and guards (those that are not miserably rotten to the bone), represent many shades of gray.One of the most touching moments in ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a scene in which an elderly convict, who has spent the better part of his adult life locked up, is brokenheartedly paroled into a modern world that is as alien to him as his outdated suit and boyhood memories. And his fear of this new and unnatural terrain, crawling with shadier creatures than those he had known behind bars and the exhaust fumes of a thousand horseless carriages rushing past, engulfed him with no hope of ever escaping.""Fear can hold you prisoner. Hope can set you free,"" from ""The Shawshank Redemption.""As bonds form between people of different ethnic groups, economic backgrounds and intellectual levels, I rejoice in their discovery of the human dignity they share. As the story unfolds, my heart hurts so hard, I cry. Then, with tears still in my eyes, I laugh, the same way my family used to laugh together at dinner or a movie when I was a little girl.Getting older. Times changing. People leaving. Dying. But at the core of the main character's spirit there shines upon all those who are within its range, including me, a contagious hope eternal. I am still astonished with the euphoria that fills my being each time I view this incredible story about the invincible human spirit."
The Shawshank Redemption,20-Apr-17,"When I first see it, I am too young to understand all the things the movie what to show us. The film gave me a very different feeling. Hope is a dangerous thing, is the root of mental distress. Because since come in the day, the warden said, ""the soul to god, the body to me.""Except that he can get the cigarettes and naked woman printed CARDS and any other changes I can't seem to grow within the walls of the dark. However Andy told him, ""remember, hope is a good thing - and perhaps even good. And no good thing will never disappear."" So Andy can use 20 years digging Red think can chisel in tunnel in six hundred.When he finally climbed out of the five hundred yards of the stench of sewage pipes, standing in the pouring rain can't help, we seem to see faith Pierce heavy darkness, played a luminous in the dark of the night out of the blue.Under the light, the soul of our weak under Andy with open arms in the sky in succession, and shaking."
The Shawshank Redemption,30-Dec-07,"One of my favorite movies ever,The Shawshank Redemption is a modern day classic as it tells the story of two inmates who become friends and find solace over the years in which this movie takes place.Based on a Stephen King novel,this movie makes us feel different watching this film than most others as this is an incredibly realistic film.Tim Robbins stars as Andy Dufresne who is convicted of murder and Morgan Freeman as Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding who is a fellow inmate and close friend of Dufresne and Bob Gunton as Warden Samuel Norton who is the Warden of Shawshank State Prison and is a character who has mixed feelings and emotions towards everyone around him and a character who is sometimes easy to like and at other times easy to despise.This film is easily considered one of the greatest films of all time and I definitely agree with this fact.It was nominated for seven Academy Awards including (Best Picture, Best Actor  Morgan Freeman, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Original Score, and Best Sound) but didn't win any due to tough competition from the film Forrest Gump.I personally think that Tim Robbins should have been nominated for the Best Actor award as he really gave the performance of his career.Bravo to this brilliant modern day classic!"
The Shawshank Redemption,01-Sep-02,"**Yes, there are SPOILERS here**This film has had such an emotional impact on me, I find it hard to write comments on it.  I've read a lot of the previous comments; all those that gush and eulogise as well as those who think it's over-rated or cliched. Most have got good points to make, however the thing that I think everyone is struggling to both explain and come to terms with is just why this film is *so* loved.  Loved to the extent that for many it is an almost spiritual experience or for those of a more secular nature like myself, loved as one of the most devastatingly uplifting things that can happen to you while watching a film.So I'm not going to review it, I'm just going to struggle in my own way to explain this film.  It took me a few viewings to get why I connect with it so deeply, but here goes.Many people in this world are unhappy.  Most people in this world don't want to be unhappy.  Lots of people wish, pray and above all hope for that magic wand to wave and wash them of their fears, losses, angers and pains once and for all.  They see lots of other people seemingly in this magical state, while they suffer.  To borrow the words of another film, they're watching the bluebirds flying over the rainbow.Many unhappy people have learned that the magic wand doesn't exist. They're not destined to join the bluebirds and fairytales don't come true.  It's not that no one lives happily ever after, it's just that they're not going to. They're busy dying.In this film, or as some people have quite correctly said, this fairytale, magic wands exist.  And that magic wand is Andy Dufrense imitating Houdini. However this film is not about him.  Neither is it about the prison, the governor, the guard, the plot, the acting, the cinematography, the script, the direction or the score.It's about Red.  He is the one who has become institutionally unhappy, he's not only trapped in a prison, not only has he given up on the idea of ever leaving, not only does he have no hope, he knows that if the miracle would ever happen to him, he couldn't cope.  He's safe in his unhappiness and that security is what keeps him going.  Hope is, as Red say, dangerous.  The metaphor for a certain illness here is very clear to me and I know that a rather large number of people suffer from it.  A large proportion of those don't understand what's wrong, but they certainly can recognise a fellow sufferer.  Those who are mercifully untouched by this illness definitely don't understand what's going on in those who do.  They're too busy living.The miracle in this film is not only that Red is redeemed but that the world outside the prison isn't all warm and sandy and sunny and with excellent fishing.  Some of it is rocky and uncertain.  Fairytales don't get this far. They'd end as Red left the gates of the prison and the credits would say 'and he lived happily ever after'.  This is the only film I can currently think of where they show how to get to the living happily ever after bit from your redemption via the rocky and uncertain ground of bagging groceries at the local store.  In other words, they're not going to cheat you and tell you everything's going to be alright.This is crucial.  For two and half hours, those of us who are quite content to mooch around our own personal prisons can see an escape route quite different to Andy's mapped out on the screen.  And it's a real way out. It's hard and upsetting, but ultimately rewarding.  The high you get from finding out and knowing that is only comparable diamorphine.The trouble is, if you're already busy living, this film won't mean that much and you'll see it a little more clearly than those busy dying.  To those fortunate individuals, watch this film and understand what the rest of us are going through.So, yes, this film is a cliched fairytale and maybe as a story it isn't realistic and at second on the IMDb all time list, it is a bit over-rated. However if you could have a chart of films listing the number of lives saved, altered and improved, the Shawshank Redemption would be way out in front at number one."
The Shawshank Redemption,13-Dec-15,"It is one of the best movies in the world that many people will join me. Watching very, very impressed. What it might be called the great stories of Stephen King anyway. Acting on cues can say is enormous. There's no posturing. Especially when Andy Dufrense incredible music that review still stands wandering on everyone's lips. Finale as you lose yourself in it is a movie you are getting into. Finals if he so exhilarating you a high-quality music. And finding that deserves really deserve. I watched this film very young age and it has taught me that the magic of cinema in a nice way. This film is one of the reasons I hate the Oscars. Will remain as the best film in more than 10 years, I believe wholeheartedly sites. Definitely one of the best films in the world."
The Shawshank Redemption,07-Sep-06,"We have all see movies, comedies, action and dramas. We all liked ones, hated others, got into some other even and felt like part of it. In Shawshank Redemption; you start slowly, after a while you get attached, by the time you reach the middle of the movie you simply totally forget about anything outside the screen and feel a mixed stream of emotions going through you head before anything else! then comes a last 20 minutes of heart storming that is surely enough to raise the adrenaline to extreme levels even in diabetics! I felt warm, strong, happy and all other emotions one can think of, I felt I was the one who won, who got out of prison, i was simply fully satisfied.This movie must be used as an Anti-depression by therapists! this movie proves that Oscars are either money bought gifts! or that who ever in charge of them are so smart that they couldn't give any Oscar to The Shawshank Redemption knowing that the movie is on different - much higher- rating scale than the Oscars.. it's simply over qualified!"
The Shawshank Redemption,05-Jun-20,Don't want to say any words about this film. Just a perfect 10.
Ford v Ferrari,16-Nov-19,"This is what cinema is supposed to be! Amazing chemistry and acting by both leads, seamless CGI and practical effects to enhance the film, a firecracker script, a true story, pulse pounding soundtrack, booming sound mix, and edited so well that 2.5 hours flies by! Completely and utterly engaging . So good in fact I saw it twice within 24 hours . Once in Imax and once in Dolby cinema ."
Ford v Ferrari,15-Nov-19,"I was at the Philadelphia Film center premiere on 11/11/19 to view this terrific movie. At the age of 68 and a tifoso of Ferrari since age 8, ( 1959 ), this movie hit a nerve. Truth vs Fiction. This was a David vs Goliath movie, however Goliath wins. The movie recreates a golden era of auto Racing. It was seriously dangerous with death and injury a guarantee at every race. These drivers were absolute warriors and we're fearless. Now Ferrari winning LeMans six straight years in a row from 1960-1965 is actually the David in this movie. Ferrari for all their dominant winning form was still a tiny company that sold fancy $15,000 sportcars to support his racing team. Winning LeMans was a $16,500 team prize. These Ferrari drivers were salaried. The prototype class at that time was wide open with no upper limit on engine size. There was an under 2 liter class that Porsche and Ferrari dino control, but the over 2 liter was unlimited. I read carefully about the Ford move to acquire Ferrari, as daily news reports would cross the associated press. The movie is spot-on about Ford cars lacking desire back then. Chevrolet had the Corvette, Corvair and sporty looking Impala and Chevelle. Now Ford is the Goliath in this movie. They are the big corporate giant with unlimited resources. Ford paid for the Ford GT. It was really a Lola Gt with a Ford badge put on it. Ford put their name on every innovation provided by all the racing/equipment suppliers that went into that race car. Unlike Ferrari being designed, engineered and built handmade in that Italian factory. Ford spent more money on developing a racecar than the total price to buy Ferrari outright. Hired every Nascar team to provide expert pit crews, engine builders and offered 80,000-100,000 to each driver for one race . Now the movie, it's a movie that non race cars fans can and will enjoy. It shows how Shelby and Miles are really the heroes of the winning team. This was true. Their relationship is spot on in the movie and they know what is needed to win. They battle off the track against Ford executives and against Ferrari on the track. What is not disclosed in the movie is the quitting of the Ferrari ace driver John Surtees. When he left Ferrari, the team was devastated. He along with Ford's Ken Miles were two true warriors. Also not shown but lightly covered in the movie is the three years of disastrous outing for the Ford racing team. Did Shelby steal the Ferrari pits stop watches? Did Shelby actually throw spear lug nuts into the Ferrari pit lane to make the Ferrari pit crew think that the race car was missing a nut on the car out on the track? Did Enzo Ferrari actually tip his hat to honor Ken Miles? Who really knows. Everybody is dead. I remember the lug nut rumour in the 1960s, as that was a southern stock car trick. I never heard about the theft of Ferrari stop watches by Shelby. As far as Ferrari tipping his hat. Ferrari was known for or not attending many races. All that aside, did I as a Ferrari fan enjoy this movie. My answer is a Yes, Yes, Yes. With the exception of James Garner in Grand Prix, this is the best movie to deal with the sport of autoracing. Bonus is that it is also a great human interest story and they create the mood of the sixties as U vividly remember it. I rate this movie a ten and should be nominated for Oscars."
Ford v Ferrari,14-Feb-20,"I've seen a lot of car movies, as a self-professed car nut. As such I judge them harshly, and immediately dismiss entries that don't provide enough reason to care about what is more important than the car: the driver. Think of the Fast and Furious and Transformers franchise. If you care about the driver, and the driver cares about the car, you care about the car. The car is a tool, an extension of the hero's body, and gains provenance with the audience when it helps the hero on their personal journey. Movies that come to mind that do this effectively include Gone in 60 Seconds, Bullitt, Need For Speed, The Italian Job, Batman Begins, and The Bourne Identity. Some of the James Bond movies do it well, like Goldfinger, The Spy Who Loves Me, The Living Daylights, and SkyFall, but many do not because of the lack of character arc in the story. We cannot forget about perhaps the greatest car movie of all time, Back to the Future. The shining example of how to make the car a proper star.And now enters a film by James Mangold and starring talented actors Matt Damon and Christian Bale called Ford v. Ferrari. My arms crossed, and expectations lowered, I was ready to be disappointed. Although I love Mangold as a director, somehow I assumed there would be a Michael Bay approach to the movie, putting more emphasis on car action sequences than the characters. To my surprise, not only was I dead wrong, but the film became one of the best car movies I had ever seen.Thinking back, I should have known better. Unlike many car action oriented movies, this one is based on a true story, and fact-based dramas tend to take themselves more seriously. It is sort of a shared biopic between legendary sports car designer Carroll Shelby and race car driver Ken Miles. The movie focuses on their efforts to beat Ferrari at Le Mans, a story I'm well aware of (like I said, bonafide car nut). And Mangold is an Oscar winning filmmaker collaborating with Oscar winning people such as Damon and Bale.And boy do their talents shine in this movie. The driving engine of the story, if you will, is the loving but at times clashing relationship between Shelby and Miles, portrayed brilliantly by Damon and Bale in a manner that in my opinion is more entertaining and engaging than the dynamic duo of DiCaprio and Pitt in Once Upon A Time ... in Hollywood. Damon and Bale have different styles of acting, but both arrive at the same place: creating a character that faces disappointment in the search for victory.Shelby has to come to terms with the disappointment of having to quit his racing career due to heart problems, and creating a winning team at Le Mans is his way of proving to himself he's still a winner. Miles is desperate not to disappoint himself because unlike Shelby, he's never had a shot at winning at a big race. This is due to his abrasive personality, despite an amazing talent on the race track. On top of this, Miles desperately doesn't want to disappoint his wife and son, who support him fervently in his dream. Both characters have their own obstacles in search of escaping disappointment, with Shelby dealing with the suits at Ford and Miles dealing with problems of the car in the race as they present themselves, and the trial of besting the other race car drivers. Their individual struggles intersect in the mutual desire to win at Le Mans, resulting in a brotherhood and mutual love for each other that feels genuine and earned.Henry Ford II, played by a very effective Tracy Letts, reveals in a quick but moving scene why he wants to win at Le Mans. After Shelby takes Ford on a whirlwind nauseating ride with the new race car they have engineered, Ford breaks into tears. Not so much because of the physically jarring experience of being jostled around at breakneck speed, but because of what the car means to his family name. ""I had no idea. If only my dad were alive to see this,"" he tells Shelby. Damon, in that scene, responds with wet eyes. The character Ford reveals how much he doesn't want to disappoint his family legacy. In fact, the entire endeavor started with an insult from Ferrari, stating, ""You're only Henry Ford the second, you'll never be Henry Ford."" And in an earlier scene, Ford compares himself to his legendary grandfather in a speech to Ford factory workers concerning his disappointment in current company sales.Cars represent man's desire to chase a dream. Whether it be designing the fastest car, or driving cars the fastest. And despite all the obstacles that may get in man's way, the biggest one is always himself. But with perseverance and the help of others, this obstacle can too be overcome. Ford v. Ferrari manages to get to the heart of this message with deceptive ease and supreme confidence. The film's absolutely gorgeous cinematography and direction capture some of the most amazing car sequences ever put to the big screen. A surprising but believable behind the scenes factoid is that Mangold and the cast are not car nuts at all, and were simply moved to tell the story of the characters. This is why the movie works so well, because they understood the car as supporting the story rather than the other way around.Ford v. Ferrari is an absolute winner, with memorable performances from its cast, and my favorite Mangold picture thus far. For me, it is one of the best of the year, and as far as car movies go, one of the best ever made, and miles away from a disappointment."
Ford v Ferrari,20-Nov-19,"Rating 10/10
Inspired movie of the year. It is wonderfully made. A good story well told. Tightly written, well acted and directed. I hope Matt Damon and Christian Bale can winning an oscar awards because he already deliver the character very well. Thank you to all of you because make it this movie so amazing . A masterpiece !!"
Ford v Ferrari,31-Aug-19,"Just saw F v F at the Telluride Film Festival and it is phenomenal. Perfect performances, incredible visuals and editing, immersive sound, and a riveting story. A real winner. Christian Bale lost 70 pounds Defoe the role and is a delight. Damon is spot on. Catriona Balfe is excellent. All the actors playing Ford executives are excellent as well. Masterful direction from James Mangold. A must see."
Ford v Ferrari,12-Feb-20,"To start off, I have always hated racing. Yes, hated. It think it's a ridiculous waste of resources, and boring to watch. I have zero interest in cars - and thus I know absolutely nothing of the history. I knew nothing of this film beyond reading the blurb before I started watching it, so I was very interested to see whether I would like it at all. I did. Despite being so uninterested in the subject, the film got me interested in the story, and especially during the final race I was on the edge of seat not knowing what would happen. Fantastic acting job from both Damon and Bale, usual. They never disappoint. Excellent writing, directing, cutting, sound editing.. A very whole package overall.To finish off; I am STILL not interested in cars or racing, but this film stands on its own even so."
Ford v Ferrari,23-Nov-19,"Ford V Ferrari is one of the best movies I've seen this year, and for someone who has little interest in cars besides minivans and SUVs, that's saying a lot. Just like the race cars produced by its namesakes, Ford v. Ferrari is sleek and fast; a powerful and expensive machine. A supremely well-balanced combination of corporate rivalry, on-track competitiveness and human drama."
Ford v Ferrari,21-Nov-19,"A lot of notes were hit by Ford v Ferrari. The characters are fleshed out very well and give you the emotional attachment you're looking for in a movie. Bale and Damon's performances are great; they pull you into the story and completely disappear into their roles. James Mangold proves, once again, to be a master behind the camera. The action scenes are shot to perfection and will have you biting your nails.The film's technical aspects were top-notch as well. Wait for this film to be nominated for sound design and editing. These technical aspects, during the climax of the film, will blow your hair back and give you goosebumps.All in all, this film provides a pleasing experience for the crowd that not many films can even come close to delivering. I loved about every second of it, despite its long runtime."
Ford v Ferrari,10-Sep-19,"Biopics can be a hard sell at times. Whether you're diving into the troubled life of an addict or exploring someone's sexuality, there are many touchy subjects these days. With that said, I feel there are also those that will stand the test of time, in terms of being able to please a wide audience. Ford v Ferrari is one of the latest true stories out of Hollywood that will be hitting the big screen soon, and here's why I believe it absolutely deserves attention.Following multiple characters throughout, Ford v Ferrari focussed on the fact that Henry Ford II was given an idea to create the fastest race car in the world. His mission is to take down the likes of the company Ferrari, who have held the title for years. Carol Shelby (Matt Damon) is approached by a member of the Ford team and is recruited, only to be the one finding himself recruiting the driver in Ken Miles (Christian Bale). That's the core premise and there's a lot to dive into from there.If you're a fan of racing or cars in general, this movie will be for you. This is a very well-directed film by James Mangold, and the racing sequences are quite long, taking up a good chunk of the nearly 150-minute run time. Luckily, they are very intense, practically shot, with a fantastic score to back it up, and sound effects to get your heart pumping. Everything about the exciting aspects of this film was top notch.Christian Bale and Matt Damon give stellar performances here as the two leading men in the film and I totally bought their rigid friendship that slowly developed. Sadly, without giving anything away, there is an incident that I feel was not explored enough, which slightly took away when a certain moment is meant to impact the movie. Other than that, this is a fantastic movie from beginning to end.In the end, Ford v Ferrari is engaging, emotional, and downright thrilling when it wants to be. I was invested in these characters and on the edge of my seat during the climactic races. I thoroughly enjoyed my experience with this movie. There is a missed opportunity in terms of emotion during a certain scene, but I was able to forgive that, seeing as the rest of the movie was so impressive. Ford v Ferrari is one of the best movies I've seen so far this year and it will be one to see when it officially releases."
Ford v Ferrari,15-Nov-19,"Jesus Christ - Bale does it again.Great script, great casting, incredible acting from everyone, but especially Bale."
Ford v Ferrari,04-Nov-19,"The Actors were magnificent, fit their characters so well. They're performances added so much to the movie.The story, which obviously is a true tell was emotional and I recommend not looking into anything before seeing the film if you don't know already. Though I'm sure if you know the story you'll still enjoy it.Shot well too. Highly recommend this film."
Ford v Ferrari,04-Nov-19,"When you think of great sports movies, Rocky, Remember the titans and Rush comes to your mind. This movie won't be know as the best sports movie of all time but would surely be among the top 20. Everything that needs to be said has already been said about the two leading stars in the movie but big shout out to the supporting cast including Jon Bernthal who was great.The story is good but it's a biographical drama so not much can be changed even though there were few liberties were taken with few facts that were presented.The sound design was excellent which made your heart race faster when you heard the roar of the Ford GT 40!Cinematography by Phedon (who was also the cinematographer for the pursuit of happiness) gives us some nice shots of the race which immerses you into action.I got to watch it as part of secret preview show! It will get few Oscar nominations but doubt it would claim any big prize.
Solid 9 out of 10 for me. A must watch if you are a racing fan or a fan of good sports movie."
Ford v Ferrari,16-Jan-20,This movie is so energy-filled action-packed emotionally-thrilled that engages you and begs for your attention in every single scene. Christian Bale gives yet another brilliant performance and so does Matt Damon and the entire cast. A movie not only for car enthusiasts but for everyone to enjoy.
Ford v Ferrari,04-Sep-19,"I attended the screening at Fox Studios yesterday and It was so good I want to see it again in IMAX. Christian Bale deserves an Oscar nom and definitely so far, the Best Film of the Year!"
Ford v Ferrari,21-Nov-19,"You have to have a big dump in your pants if all you're gonna do is complain about ""historical inaccuracies"" of a movie. Extremely entertaining film. Great cast, fun movie. Bale crushes it per usual."
Ford v Ferrari,14-Sep-19,Both Matt Damon and Bales performances were fantastic and brilliantly directed by James ( by far his best directed film to date!)Along with the excellent duo Oscar worthy performances the racing sequences were upmost beautifully made along with the films cinematography!Im fully confident and expecting multiple Oscar nominations on all fronts for this joyful movie!!
Ford v Ferrari,16-Nov-19,Honestly I went to watch this movie with zero expectation and knowledge of the plot. The film is a history of Le Mans '66 told with a thrill ride from Bale and Damon with stunning visual racing scenes. James Mangold has done a fantastic job as a director. Worth the watch in a movie theater.
Ford v Ferrari,29-May-20,"Everything is fine about this film. The plot, the screenplay , cinematography and the acting. Surely Christian Bale steal the show. Big thumbs up to Ford vs Ferrari."
Ford v Ferrari,04-Nov-19,"Nice surprise at the Cineworld secret screening with this. Bale and Damon have great chemistry. I struggled with Bale's UK Northern accent occasionally, but a story of risk, achievement and friendship, with some great driving scenes. Would recommended, especially for any race fans.
8/10"
Ford v Ferrari,20-Nov-19,"Despite the love affair cinema has had with cars over the years, the sport of motor racing on film has been patchy. Too often the drama on the track has been deluged with melodrama off the track, as in John Frankenheimer's ""Grand Prix"" from 1966. While recent efforts such as Ron Howard's ""Rush"" have brought modern filming techniques to better convey the speed and excitement, it is Steve McQueen's ""Le Mans"" from 1971 that had previously set the bar for realism in the sport. But even there, there were a few off-track love stories to interweave into the action.I wouldn't hesitate to suggest that ""Le Mans '66"" is a strong contender for the motor racing high-water mark.The film was marketed as ""Ford v Ferrari"" in the US. (What... do the American distributors think their film-goers are so stupid that if ""Le"" is in the title they will think it sub-titled foreign language??). But it's a valid title, since the movie tells the true story of when Henry Ford... the second... (Tracy Letts) throws his toys out of the pram at Ford's faltering progress. (""James Bond does not drive a Ford"". ""That's because he's a degenerate!"" snaps back Ford, which kind of typifies the problem""). Marketing man Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal) persuades retired hot-shot racer Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) to take Ford's blank-cheque to build a car to win the Le Mans 24 hour race.Shelby enlists maverick Brit racer Ken Miles (Christian Bale) to help design and drive the next-generation machine. But neither had banked on the interference of the hoards of Ford suits, led by VP Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas). An explosion is imminent! And its not just from the over-heated brake pads!What's really odd about this film is how linear the story is. While we get to see the family life of Miles (to add necessary context to what follows) these are merely minor diversions. There are no sub-plots or flashback scenes. It just relates the history from beginning to end, enlivened by some of the best and most exciting motor-racing footage put to celluloid.At a bladder-testing 152 minutes, this really shouldn't have worked. I should have got bored and restless. But I really didn't.In many ways - bladders aside - I think this will appeal in particular to an older breed of movie-goer. It's a 100% 'sit back in your seat and enjoy' cinema treat.This is the first film Matt Damon and Christian Bale have made together, and I understand that Damon specifically signed on since he wanted to work with Bale. And there is palpable chemistry there. The movie includes one of the best 'bad-fights' since Colin Firth and Hugh Grant locked horns in the Bridget Jones films. And Damon - never one of the most expressive actors in the world - here really shines.Bale also appears to be having a whale of a time. Not having to adopt a US accent suits him, as he blasts and swears his way through various UK-specific expletives that probably passed the US-censors by! He often tends to play characters in movies that are difficult to warm to, but here - although suitably spiky and irascible - the family man really shines through and you feel a real warmth for the guy.There's a strong supporting cast behind the leads, with Tracy Letts' fast-driving breakdown being a standout moment. I wonder how many takes they needed on that for Damon to keep a semi-straight face?! Also impressive as the son Peter Miles is Noah Jupe. If you're wondering where the hell you've seen him before, he was young (Marcus in ""A Quiet Place"").Where the film comes alive is on the track, and a particular shout out should to to the technical teams. Cinematography is by Phedon Papamichael (""Walk the Line""), film editing is led by Andrew Buckland and Michael McCusker. And sound mixing - which to my ear was piston-valve perfect - is by Steven Morrow. Also worthy of note is a kick-ass driving soundtrack by Marco Beltrami that genuinely excited. These categories are fearsomly hard to predict in awards season, but you might like to listen out for those names.If I was going to pick at any faults in the film, it would be that Ford exec Leo Beebe is painted a little too much as a ""boo-hiss"" pantomime villain in the piece. It could have been perhaps toned down 20% or so.James Mangold (""Logan""; ""Walk the Line"") directs in style. From the rather po-faced trailer, you might think this is a ""car movie that's not for me"". But it really is a tremendously fun movie, with some genuinely laugh-out-loud moments mixed in with edge-of-your-seat action and some heart-rending moments.Above all, this is a film that really benefits from the wide-screen and sound-system that only a big cinema can provide. As such this goes on my ""get out and see it"" list without any hesitation! It's going to make my movies of the year: and I'm off to see it again on Saturday!(Read the full graphical review on One Mann's Movies on the web or Facebook. Thanks)."
Ford v Ferrari,28-Nov-19,One of the best movies I've seen this year. A reminder that not all modern movies suck.
Ford v Ferrari,10-Feb-20,"I like the movie a lot, one of the best in so much a long time, the two lead actors nailed their roles and the story line is so good, effects and CGI are both great and the movie pretty much tells a story of faith and hard work on top of talent."
Ford v Ferrari,19-Jan-20,"Yes indeed, I say it; as good as ""Rush"" (the rivalry between Hunt and Lauda). This movie focuses on the rivalry between Ford and Ferrari. And focuses even more on the deal between Carroll Shelby and Mr. H. Ford II. And the driver/mechanic of one of the cars during Le Mans in 1966: Ken Miles.Christian (Bale) and Matt (Damon) are portraying there characters really well. I didn't know that Bale was British, now I know. But either way, every character in the film is believable. The story - based upon real life, so not completely accurate - is entertaining and comes close to the real deal.If you are looking for the real story of the race (and the events towards that) this ain't the movie for you, because it's a movie and not a documentary. And the movie needs to entertain the crowd that is coming towards this piece. So who should watch it ? Autosport fans for sure, Endurance fans absolutely (like myself), car enthusiasts perhaps - depending on which car-class(es).The way they set the whole vibe (I was instantly back at my first trip to Le Mans (2012)). The way they show you the track and the rivalry, and the cars. It's really an awesome movie. Just like Rush. Yes Rush was more about the race, but had also a story but a bit thinner then this one. The story isn't a big one in this one, but it's there. And if you expect a Rush look-a-like you will be sad, so expect more story !I will definitely get this on DVD."
Ford v Ferrari,08-Feb-20,"Frankly speaking, whoever reading this review right now, please stop reading any more reviews wasting your time. Trust me, undoubtedly this movie belongs to the ""Best of 2019"". So what are you waiting for? I bet you won't regret after watching it.Happy watching!!! 🙂"
Ford v Ferrari,03-Feb-20,"Review:
'Ford v Ferrari' is a sports-drama film directed by James Mangold.
What a film this is! I really wish I had waited to do my top ten list of 2019 until I seen this movie. My eyes were glued to the screen the whole time I was watching it.
The plot follows a determined team of American engineers and designers, led by automotive visionary Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) and his British driver, Ken Miles (Christian Bale), who are dispatched by Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts) and Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal) with the mission of building the Ford GT40, a new racing car with the potential to finally defeat the perennially dominant Ferrari racing team at the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans race in France.
Christian Bale and Matt Damon give stellar performances here as the two leading men in the film and I totally bought their rigid friendship that slowly developed. Jon Bernthal shows that he is more than an action guy when it comes to his acting capabilities, and Josh Lucas might just be the evillest villain to come out of 2019, including Thanos himself. What a dick he is in this movie and he plays it to perfection.
James Mangold proves, once again, to be a master behind the camera. The action scenes are shot to perfection and will have you biting your nails. The race scenes have the tension they need, and Matt Damon and Christian Bale bring the humor without over doing it.
Overall, this is entertainment at its finest. There are some true story films that don't relate well to the big screen, this one will excel expectations. Great direction with a phenomenal cast is an A+.
5/5"
Interstellar,27-Sep-19,"The best movie I ever saw and I watched hundreds off them from Godfather, Pulp fiction, The green mile, The pianist, Schindler's list, Rear window, The shining, Alien etc. What can you ask more: space exploration, apocalyptic earth, emotions, tears, time manipulation, amazing visuals, maybe the best music score, touching acting, everything you want. SHAME on all the oscar ""experts""!"
Interstellar,26-Jun-19,"After watching this insane movie in the theatres back in 2014 I swore to god I will wait 5 years to watch it again so I get to forget it and experince the insanity it has again
This without doubt is THE BEST MOVIE EVER MADE"
Interstellar,08-Apr-15,"This movie was the best written, acted, visual effected, etc. movie. This movie was the best movie I have ever seen. I am a huge Christopher Nolan fan and this movie was his finest. Matthew McConaughey turned in his best performance of his lifetime. Anne Hathaway was an amazing supporting actress and compared to her performance in Les Miserables, I have no idea how she didn't get an Oscar for this. The visual effects were more than just Oscar worthy. They were pioneering. I have never seen anything like it. One thing I would recommend is having a little previous knowledge about space. Not like Einstein stuff though. I would recommend you see this movie as fast as you can if you are a Nolan fan or not. I give this movie a rating of 97 out of 100."
Interstellar,06-Apr-15,"I judge a movie by how long it takes me to realize I need the bathroom, how long the movie can hold my interest and how convincing the events unfolding are. Well, I watched this movie all the way through with no bathroom breaks. My interest was grabbed from the start and held all the way through. Being old enough, and lucky enough to have watched the premiere of 2001 A Space Odyssey - and viewed it several times since - of course I made comparisons, and there were a few, but this movie tells an excellent stand alone story that is both riveting and believable. I'm not going to give away any secrets but anyone who watches the last five minutes or so without a lump in their throat and a tear in their eye, well you're a critic, you're not enjoying the movie because you're too busy looking for bloopers and faults. Were there bloopers and faults? The darn movie was so riveting if there were any I didn't notice them!"
Interstellar,14-Dec-15,"Interstellar - ReviewCertain things in life are precious. Very precious. And so was the Film for me.Why you might ask?Well seldom do i get the chance where i find myself sitting in a cinema anxious and intrigued by what might come. In a time where trailers are omnipresent and going to the movies without having seen one seems unreasonable, outright stupid to some i had the magical chance to find myself in front of the IMAX on a cold November night with 2 tickets to Interstellar. My only knowledge was that Nolan directed it and McConaughey stars in it.The images were brilliant the acting was top notch and everything was blended together by Hans Zimmer and his Music. 169 minutes flew by me with my eyes fixed on the screen and my heart racing. And there it was.. The ending. I couldn't believe it . I was reliving, rethinking the movie while the credit scenes rolled enjoying the moment, the smell of popcorn, my comfortable seat and what do i see next to me? Ninety percent of the people in the cinema rushing outside after the first second of the credit scenes. .. .Well apparently people enjoy movies different than i do. Maybe i should start watching trailers again :)."
Interstellar,05-Nov-14,"I have been a cinema lover for years, read a lot of reviews on IMDb and everywhere, and never found the right movie to write my first review. I always thought I would wait for THE movie.And this is IT!When I first heard that Nolan was preparing a sci-fi movie, I felt like a kid again, waiting for his Christmas gift under the tree. I knew it would become a classic. And I'm sure it will.First of all, it is incredibly beautiful to watch. Honestly, it was so beautiful that I felt like I was sucked into the movie. The way Nolan decided to show some scenes really remind me of 2001 A Space Odyssey (actually many things will probably remind you of this movie). We can feel the talent of Christopher Nolan, just by looking at the way it is filmed. The techniques he used contribute to create that visual environment in a believable way.The sound environment is just mesmerizing. It is a very important part of the movie, because some scenes take place in space, and Noland just found the right way to use sound. The soundtrack (made by the great Hans Zimmer) is breathtaking, epic, amazing, unreal. I could find a lot more adjectives to qualify it, but you have to hear it to understand how epic they are. These two important parts (image and sound) create a stunning atmosphere. You will forget you are in a movie theater, and you will be lost in space, sucked into the adventures of this new Space Odyssey, begging for more. It is a truly unique experience. I can say that I have never felt something like that in a movie theater (at least not for the past ten years).Then, of course, the cast. First of all, Matthew McConaughey. I discovered this actor in Tropic Thunder, but he didn't really convince me, though he was quite funny. Then I saw Dallas Buyers Club. Since that movie, I love him. In this movie... Well, he is the movie. I exaggerate a bit, since there are other great actors (some even unexpected with a special guest) who play extremely well. But he is just what was needed to feel the human part of the story (which is very important in Interstellar). He is capable of making us feel so many different emotions all along the story, as a father, as a human. Anne Hathaway was very convincing, all together the actors managed to create some harmony, which makes the human interactions credible. Caine, Chastaing and Affleck are a perfect choice. And then there is... The special guest, I will call him ""X"". His role, which could be seen as a minor role, is actually much more important than that. He proves, once again, that he is a great actor. Watch and see.And finally, the scenario/story. I won't spoil anything here; I'll just try to convince you how great it is. Nolan is known to revolutionize everything when he tries a new genre in cinema. Well, once again he did it. With The Dark Knight he revolutionized the superhero genre. With Interstellar he's revolutionizing the sci-fi genre in cinema. From what I heard, he worked with a physicist (in gravitational physics and astrophysics) to help him with that movie. And we can feel and see it. During the fifties, Asimov laid the foundations of modern science fiction. Lucas and Kubrick did the same in cinema. Today, Nolan is laying the new foundations of the genre in cinema, proving that cinema is still at the beginning of what can be done (brace yourselves my friends, we have not seen anything yet). Why? Well, simply because we only know a few things about space, some things can't be proved for the moment, so we can use theory, and make the best of it. That is exactly what Nolan did. He used theories that exist today, and made a movie about mankind, about pioneers, about humanity, about us.Because, in spite of all the sci-fi aspect, it is a story about humanity. McConaughey, Hathaway, and mainly ""X"", will managed to convince you about that.My rating for this movie can only be a 10, because in itself, it is a beginning for a new kind of cinema. It IS a classic. Those who say ""we can't compare this movie to 2001 Space Odyssey, nor can we compare Nolan to Kubrick"" are wrong. We can, and we should. Talented people don't live only in the past, some genius live today, among us. And Nolan is one of them. Many say that he is overrated. I truly don't think so. Only time will answer that.This is the sci-fi movie of the decade, and probably the best movie Nolan ever made. Just go for it, without a second thought."
Interstellar,17-Apr-19,All is amazing. I can't describe anything. It's a film that leads you to think about yourself and your plans in your life. I am a real series/movies' lover and... This was awesome.
Interstellar,13-Apr-16,"Interstellar is a movie like no other. Unlike many apocalyptic sci-fi films that feature advanced technology as the source of our destruction (ala The Terminator movies), it instead asserts that technology will save us.Not everyone in Interstellar recognizes the potential of advanced technology. Most dismiss it as a waste of time and resources, and not just old curmudgeons feel this way. Thoughtful, intelligent young characters share this sentiment. This belief gained steam following a world-wide blight that wiped out the vast majority of life on earth—crops and humans.Farming became paramount while advanced technology was deemed frivolous. Cooper (McConaughey) remains one of the few survivors who still appreciates the need for engineering. He feels like a man lost in time, until he stumbles into the headquarters of NASA (which had been operating in secret due to public disapproval). Here he meets others who realize that a return to our old ways is unsustainable and will ultimately lead to our demise. We need technology to save us. As Michael Caine, playing the brilliant (duh!) Professor Brand, eloquently tells Cooper, ""we were never meant to save the world. We were meant to leave it."" For a movie that won an Oscar for Best Visual Effects (and deservedly so) the sound stole the show. Hans Zimmer (Dark Knight Trilogy) unleashed a performance that was, quite appropriately, out of this world. Never have I seen a movie elevated so much by its score. The sound literally took my breath away. Forgive me for the next paragraph. I will gush irresponsibly about the magic that is this movie's sound. Skip it if you please. You have your warning.The music fueled every important scene. In every meaningful moment Zimmer's harmonies captivated watchers' attention in the way of a coach commanding a locker room with a pregame speech. The music elucidated those emotional scenes, particularly ones featuring Cooper and his daughter, in a way that no words or visual ques possibly could. I sat frozen, jaw agape, with tears pouring down my cheeks as the music completely overwhelmed my emotions. The sound penetrated my soul and reverberated through my body, flowing to my appendages, supplying me with life like a heartbeat pumping blood through my veins. The music was truly the life force of movie.Yes, we all witnessed a visual triumph, a daring creative wonder the likes of which we haven't encountered since Inception. Yes, nearly every actor's performance proved worthy of commendation. McConaughey is on fire. Chastain is blossoming into a star. At this point Michael Cain exudes such knowledge and wisdom by merely appearing on screen that if he were cast as Albert Einstein, people would wonder if the role were beneath him. All this considered, and the sound still towered over everything.I walked out of the theater believing that I had experienced something unique, something truly special. Interstellar inspires, it awes, and above all it entertains. I cannot ask for more than that."
Interstellar,06-Oct-19,THIS IS A MANKIND ACHIEVEMENT.THE BEST MOVIE EVER MADE.IS ANYONE HAS DOUBT?
Interstellar,01-Nov-14,"The film begins by establishing at his own rhythm its ambitions: men overexploited land resources, which is why the only goal they have left is to survive. This life is not enough for Cooper, brilliantly played by McConaughey who gave body and soul to this character. But all of this wouldn't hold without the total control of Christopher Nolan, based on the languishing soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, the luminous and impenetrable photography of Hoyte Van Hoytema, and the sincerity of Nolan's directing. He manages to film the characters and to find the right cut at the right time, always in harmony with Hans Zimmer's soundtrack, to give the film an aspiring and inspiring dimension that went missing for many many years. Thus we are transported into the same cockpit that Cooper, we feel the same remorse that he can already feel, we feel the same gravity, and we feel the same fear of the unknown melted with the force of his will. All of this is brilliantly illustrated in a very simple directing choice, which from my point of view is the decisive impetus of the film: to directly jump from when Cooper leaves in his truck, leaving his family behind him, to Endurance taking off. This simple editing decision allows Nolan to give an original movement to his film, and the musical crescendo makes us physically feel the sentimental break between two parts of the film.You don't necessarily have to understand it immediately : The film will raise questions in you, such as : what is it to be a human being, is there some physical limitations to our humanity, how far could we be willing to go to determine knowledge, is there other dimensions that we can not access to, and above all: what is the nature of this intact and immutable bond that unites us to others wherever we are in the universe ? Is this bond only intelligible, or is it also tangible ? All these questions resonate in harmony in Nolan's Interstellar. Interstellar is itself a crescendo, increasing sensitivity and creativity. I use the term deliberately because it goes crescendo with the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, which is one of the most beautiful music ever scored for a sci-fi movie. We are witnessing a perfect musical arrangement, a total symbiosis, a bit like the music of Gravity which had understood very well how to match the image and the rhythm of a sequence to its own musicality. Zimmer's crescendos are giving a new powerful breath to every new scene, whether it is in visually powerful & intense moments or in more intimate moments; it intrudes into our momentary feelings and sensations, and manages to extend them, sometimes almost to choking, before resting on the balance of the film frame along with our mind spell-bounded. I have seen all the talent of the director that I knew he was outside the norm, but whom I did not know his capacity to reinvent itself. Because this is it: Interstellar is not an action movie, not really a blockbuster, and it goes not entirely but mostly again the expectations of common people. It's much more than that. This is much more than just a sci-fi movie. It is unlike any of his previous films. Some hoped to see Interstellar as Christopher Nolan's best film, and they were disappointed that this was not the case. And indeed, THIS IS NOT THE BEST FILM of Christopher Nolan. Because in a way, IT IS HIS FIRST FILM. I'm not saying that Interstellar is not as good as his other films, it goes beyond all of them. But to me Interstellar is the first film of a new stage in Nolan's filmography ; it is a masterpiece as it the beginning of a work ahead. Interstellar is the proof that Nolan has finally managed, despite all the expectations that were placed on him after the success of The Dark Knight, to move away from his own reputation to create a personal work, original, humble, sincere and deeply, meticulously, measured.Now, in this third act of the film, it all comes to life with unparalleled strength. Nolan poses and answers questions that raise others. But he focuses his attention on the great mystery of love, that emotional bond that can unite men and sometimes separate them. But Nolan is the only one that can successfully speak of love from a being to another in a film that mainly takes place in a another galaxy. From my point of view, only Solaris by Steven Soderbergh (2002), unfortunately neglected by the audience, was able to accomplish that. Interstellar is based on a premise which is the following : from terrestrial dust to the depths of space and time, we can never be separated from who we are as individuals and as a species, as we always leave a part of ourselves ""behind"" us. In other words, I could say that this is a human story, and even if we go as far as we want to, if we travel through the universe believing that we can be detached of the one we are fond of, we will only get closer to them. Because the separation, and thus the distance and time, can only ultimately reinforce the relationship between the people who really love each other. Because it is going to the end of the world, when we reach the end of ourselves, that we reach the singularity of the ""black hole beyond the horizon"" * : it is our humanity. No, I wasn't been able to find any bad flaws in the film. Not one, and I'm still looking. After all, Interstellar is like gravity, ""all it takes is a little push ! ""*you'll have to see the movie to figure that one out.Félix Tardieu, November 1st, 2014"
Interstellar,08-Nov-14,"I was extremely lucky to get the chance to see this film upon its first day release, before entering the cinema, my expectations were already high, after all, this was a film from the cinematic genius who brought us the likes of 'Inception' and 'The Dark Knight', to summarise the following review in a single sentence: I left the cinema in extreme awe from the visual masterpiece I had just viewed. A film that explores the psychological and emotional state of a man whose life revolves around his family, 'Interstellar' is a thrilling and thought-provoking film that boasts an intellectual story masterfully written by the Nolan brothers. Whilst there seems to have been influence from films like '2001: A Space Odyssey' and 'Apollo 13', 'Interstellar' is unique in its own way. Whilst the subject may be hard to comprehend at times, it can't be denied how visually monumental and thoughtful Christopher Nolan's epic science fiction masterpiece is, and can easily be named the best film of this year and possibly one of the greatest science fiction films to have ever graced the screen. A sheer brilliant feat of cinema."
Interstellar,03-Nov-14,"(This is both a review of the film, and an assertion of Christopher Nolan's filmmaking style)There have been many reviewers and critics alike that have high praise for the film (the visual effects, the acting, the music), but say how it's not Christopher Nolan's best directed film. This is where i personally would have to disagree. Before i get into it, though, i'll talk about Interstellar a bit.Interstellar is truly a sci-fi epic like no other. To compare said film to '2001: A Space Odyssey' isn't just a disservice, but unnecessary. The films are almost nothing alike, simply sharing small plot elements. Also, Stanley Kubrick's vision of Arthur C. Clarke's sci-fi epic wasn't to ponder the philosophical questions that accompanied the story, but to make art, and art is was, and is. With Interstellar, Mr. Nolan set out to make his most personal and emotional film to date about love and time (time being a recurring theme throughout all of Nolan's films). But it's so much more than that too. There are no words to express the epic journey Nolan takes us on in the film, but needless to say, it's tear-jerking and emotional throughout. The acting is top-notch, especially McConaughey, who gives (I would say) his most emotional performance yet. But the actor who stole the show in a few scenes (one in particular, when they're on an alien planet) was David Gyasi as Romilly, one of the astronauts aboard the Endurance, their spacecraft. The musical score from Hans Zimmer is, without a doubt, his best and most influential work to date, helping drive the film's bold and breath-taking vision (the church organ helped significantly). The visual effects are easily the best to date as well, and of the year. To see a black hole created through visual effects in such a way, with pages theoretical equations provided by Kip Thorne (theoretical physicist, of whom's work inspired the film's genesis); what you see in the film is the most realistic depiction of a black hole, and even offered new insight to accretion discs surrounding the anomalies. But even everything else, from the alien planets to the Endurance, the visuals always look real. Then, there's the writing. I would definitely have to say this has some of the best dialogue i've ever heard in a sci-fi movie, and the script continually pours or oozes emotion, keeping the audience tethered to the film.Now, about Mr. Nolan. Don't just look at Nolan, but look at his films. Some say Inception would be his masterpiece, while others would say it's The Dark Knight, or Memento. But honestly, every single film Christopher Nolan has directed is a masterpiece not of its genre, but of Nolan. Following is his quiet masterpiece, not the film that put Mr. Nolan on the map as a phenomenal director, but one people visited or revisited after becoming accustomed to Nolan, after seeing Memento, what could be called his breakout masterpiece. Then, right after, he directed the remake of the Norwegian thriller, Insomnia. This, too, could be considered a masterpiece, even if a remake. Then, we were given his take on the Batman universe, starting with Batman Begins, the origin masterpiece. Then, there's The Prestige, adapted from the novel of the same name, which can be called his dark masterpiece. The Dark Knight, his bold masterpiece; Inception, his complex masterpiece, and The Dark Knight Rises, his flawed masterpiece. Now, we have Interstellar, his emotional or personal masterpiece.This is just my looking at Nolan and his films, but whatever your thoughts are, you can't deny Interstellar is one hell of a journey. He certainly is one of the best filmmakers of our time, and of all time. I can't wait to see what he does next, but i'm not sure it will be as emotionally powerful as Interstellar."
Interstellar,05-Nov-14,"'Interstellar' was incredible. The visuals, the score, the acting, were all amazing. The plot is definitely one of the most original I've seen in a while. Most of the critic reviews have said that some bits are a little too unbelievable, but I have to disagree. Yes, there were some parts that were definitely in the ""fi"" part of sci-fi. But the thing is, 'Interstellar' deals with concepts that we know very little about. We have no idea what the 4th or 5th dimension is like, or what it would be like to go through a wormhole or a black hole. I don't think it's fair to call something unbelievable, when we have absolutely no idea what WOULD be believable in those circumstances. Either way, excellent writing from the Nolan brothers. The visuals were outstanding, and will no doubt be nominated for an Oscar. The performances were excellent, though nothing Oscar worthy, as is the case with most of Nolan's films ('The Dark Knight' being the obvious exception). Hans Zimmer's score was amazing and blended perfectly with the film. All in all, 'Interstellar' is an excellent movie, which I personally think is Nolan's most beautiful film to date."
Interstellar,24-Jun-18,"I hadn't seen this but movie and caught it on a flight back from the DR. 
One of my favorite movies of all time. I would give the first half of the movie an 11/10, just completely enjoyed it as a sci fi/ thriller(in the sense of so much always being on the line). I loved the acting and just yeah, a great movie and one you should go see if you never have"
Interstellar,04-Nov-14,"Love is the one thing that transcends time and space... New creation of Christopher Nolan's genius, whose name is now known to everyone. His films are waiting with a special look, because it offers something that every day, unfortunately, less and less can be found in the world of mass cinema - an interesting spectacle, filled with meaning, ideas and emotions. At this time, Christopher decided to send us not to the world of dreams, and even not on the dark streets of Gotham City. No, now he send us to the journey to, and perhaps beyond the boundaries of the possible and impossible, through the curvature of space and time, in other worlds. And you won't forget this trip, this can be assured. I was madly waiting for Interstellar's release. And then, finally, I was able to see this Beauty - at the premiere in my coutry on October, 29. It was incredibly exciting. It was a delight. It was unforgettable. It was gorgeous. Nolan once again amazes the viewer's imagination by his painting. Journey to the brink of infinity, the line where humanity has never set, acts as either the first-born purpose and a background of emotional history about the father and the daughter. A loving father who mankind need to help, but that he should leave his children, and a loving daughter who doesn't want to let her dad in the infinity darkness. Starting from the very first frame and ending with the closing credits, a new picture of Nolan will absorb you completely, forcing stare at the screen during the whole action, because it's all so exciting and interesting that escape becomes physically impossible. No, this three hours won't fly quickly for you. You'll feel every emotion, every event, every character. You will not look how the main characters travel through the universe, because the movie experience in this film is so excellent that you will be on board of ""Endurance"" starship and travel between the worlds with the main characters by yourself.The emotional core of this story is the relationship of Matthew McConaughey's character and his daughter - Mackenzie Foy' and Jessica Chastain' character. And the acting work of these three artists in ""Interstellar"" impress the most. McConaughey was acting really great, and this is one of the most emotional, if not the most emotional role of his life. All the drama and tragedy of the relationship of father and daughter in this film will not leave anyone indifferent. Anne Hathaway, Wes Bentley, Michael Caine, Casey Affleck, Ellen Burstyn and other actors also coped with their roles and presented the film's supporting characters very realistic. I would particularly like to note a small but important in this story role of Matt Damon, a character who has received quite memorable. If we talk about the characters, it should be noted also two robots that accompanied our heroes in this difficult journey. One of them adds a touch of humor in the film, which mitigates constantly depressing, dramatic, and sometimes really dark atmosphere.The script of the film is very well combined the history of space exploration and the relationship between Cooper and Murph. The story is complex and complicated, is based on real scientific theories by Kip Thorne, and indeed contains a reference to the ""Space Odyssey"" and other sci-fi pictures. This story about true love, about loyalty, forgiveness, fraud, hard decisions, and much more. And it is designed so that leaves a lot of room for the imagination of the viewer. It's also possible to notice some structure allusion to another Nolan's work - Inception. The story and visuals are combined just perfectly in Interstellar.Hans Zimmer's score, written by him on the basis of only one letter from Nolan, hold the key: ""Once we become parents, we can't help but look at ourselves through the eyes of our children"", deserves a special praise. On this basis, Hans managed to write just incredible soundtrack that perfectly harmonizes with the history and the visual side of the picture. And this work of the composer is really different from the previous ones. It is executed in a different style from another subject in its base. Very impressive work, which will be pleasantly listened again and separate from the film itself. Visual range of the picture is incredibly beautiful and circuses. The ""Endurance"" itself, new worlds, insanely beautiful and mysterious space, wormholes, black holes, and travel through them, folds of time and space are arranged so that is simply breathtaking. I would like to thank all those who contributed to the creation of a visual of this film. It must be seen. That mastery with which this is done, not just words. In the visual pattern also has some references to the Kubrick's ""Odyssey"", and they are pleasing to the eye.Many thanks to Christopher Nolan for having given us such an incredible movie, which once again proved to us that the cinema is Nolan's life. ""Interstellar"" is a film that wins the hearts of the audience not only with its sci-fi splendor, but also an emotional story that lies at its very heart. This film is not only about the discoveries, space exploration and the final frontier of mankind, but also about the relationship of father and daughter, who were in a difficult situation in life when one has to leave the other in the name of a goal that can not be underestimated. So, with what Nolan's genius unfolds before us this action is beyond praise. Combining the story, filled with not only real science fiction, but the true human values ​​and emotions, outstanding and very emotional performances, breathtaking visuals, epic and dramatic soundtrack, Christopher Nolan breathed the life into this film by his directing to create something truly masterpiece again. ""Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night... Rage, Rage Against The Dying Of The Light."""
Interstellar,04-Nov-14,"So last night I got the chance to see the early screening of Christopher Nolan's Interstellar. The film I've been waiting so much from the early days of the shooting. How did it fare? Here's my take:To avoid any tl;dr risk, let me get this straight from the very beginning, Interstellar is one goddamnedly good film, it gets you to the edge of your seat, it soars, it warps, it rips your brain senseless. It's that good.Interstellar is a story about the earth dying, with its soil no longer able to sustain crops other than corn, and of course, it will lead to the extinction of humanity. Our hero is an ex-NASA test pilot named Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), a typical ordinary-guy-in-an-extraordinary- situation everyman who's also a dedicated family man, especially toward his daughter Murphy (named after the Murphy's Law). In an all-too-Armageddon style our hero gets invited by the (publicly) defunct NASA to become humanity's last hope in finding a new home, for they have found a wormhole near Saturn (2001, anyone?) which will warp the astronauts to another galaxy in quest of a habitable planet. Solid and compact premise, although it's been used before.For seasoned filmgoers, there are many similar elements (although it's understandable) with Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and Robert Zemeckis' Contact (1997). In a sense that this is not a bang-bang-shoot-shoot-blow-em-up sci-fi, but more of a slow-burning, metaphysical sci-fi which gets you to think about your place in the universe and your exact place in time.Similarity with 2001 and Contact is never a bad thing, but it becomes a wee bit too predictable, although Nolan is a smart enough director in providing the final (a very sentimental one, I should say) twist in the story. The visuals in this film is majestic, everything is shot to a meticulously calculated level, Nolan-style. The space scenes are serenely suspenseful just like Cuaron's Gravity, but unlike the documentary feel of Gravity, there's a real gusto and pace to these scenes. You should also be prepared for the (for some, maybe) unexpected third act, it is Nolan's most sentimental and humane moment to date. And this is why Interstellar is more than just a science-fiction, it is a human drama intertwined in space and time loop.One thing that Nolan gets a bit wrong is the narrative. Nolan was never a 'warm' director, his films are filled with brilliant ideas and flair but it feels cold, it maybe suits Memento and The Dark Knight but in Interstellar he seems to have been lost in determining which of the interpersonal drama or the sci-fi that will be Interstellar's forte. The result is a rather incongruous script, intermittently cutting off the excitement of the previous scene and so on. But it is a forgivable sin, for the good is a lot more than the bad in this monumental film. At the end of the day, all I can say is that Interstellar is a grand film. It is monolithic, thoughtful, sentimental, sophisticated, visceral but also with its flaws. I wouldn't say it's Nolan's best work to date, but I daresay that this is one of the best science fiction ever released.After watching Interstellar, do yourself a favor and get lost in space and time and go back in time to see Contact (1997) and 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) to further wonder and wander into the realms of the unknown.Because sometimes it is the unknown that fascinates us, frightens us and brings out the best in us."
Interstellar,03-May-15,"The ones that you still think of weeks even months later. The ones that make you think and leave you breathless. The ones that inspire you to want to change your life after a mere two and a half hours.I watched this movie the first time over a month and a half ago and it still crops up in my mind. The thought of space travel excites me along with countless others and this movie has literally made me rethink my life choices and pushed me into wanting to become an astronaut. As childish as it sounds, its true, because its one of those movies. Interstellar has become my new favourite movie by far.Bravo Nolan what a great human bean"
Interstellar,04-Nov-14,"Just watched Interstellar in imax 70mm. Science Fiction fans can read on, everyone else can skip. Movie is a visual masterpiece. Like his earlier movies, Christopher Nolan once again proved, how big a movie can be! There were some shots,which made audience go crazy..Some scenes were as epic as 2001: A Space Odyssey. Do not go into the theatre expecting an action packed cerebral thriller. This one is not for action fans. At times, movie go highly sentimental( Matthew McConaughey does what he is best in and supposed to). I recommend this movie to all the Sci-Fi fans out there, make sure you go in group of sci-fi nuts!! Do not go with the hype..Go, sit back and enjoy. Just like Inception, this movie will be known as great after few months(I know people who said Inception was a crap when it released, and after few months rating it 10/10 in IMDb :D). I don't wanna spoil anything(If you want PM me). Also, make sure you go to the best theatre close to you. (If you loved Donnie Darko, 2001: A Space Odyssey, this is the one for you, Get ready to get mind blown!!) Interstellar Movie is EPIC in all sense!!"
Interstellar,03-Apr-15,"A lot has been said and heard about this movie but none of it comes even close to the experience of watching it. It has all the elements of a Nolan movie and just like in all of his other movies he decides to go a bit further. This time, he went a little too far. The story behind the movie has it's flaws. There really is no explanation of what happened/is happening. Instead you are given fragments in the first half of the movie hoping one will put all the pieces together. All in all, the first part seems a bit rushed and leaves you wondering if more could have been told. But, since the real story is not why the travel is necessary but the travel itself once the crew is off, the story really kicks in. The main part of the movie gives a great ride, pumps your blood with adrenaline from time to time and gets you emotional pretty often. The problem I personally had was that the story taking place simultaneously on Earth was less shown than I expected. A different approach was expected but that did not stop Chastain from giving the best role in the movie. The last part of the movie is dynamic and filled with problems real people would have if found in a situation like that. But the explanation given at the very end was a bit to much for me. I heard that this was called ""the most scientifically accurate movie"" and that physicist around the world fought over the fact was that true or not. Nevertheless, way too much theoretical physics in the end. Since I love SF movies I am willing to look past the over- the-top science part, but what really got to me was that it was predictable. From the very moment I saw a black hole in the movie I put two and two together and that kinda ruined it for me a little. Regarding the acting, as I said before, Chastain gave the most powerful performance in the movie. She doesn't have much screen time, but she sure knows how to use it. The two that actually lead the movie - McConaughey and Hathaway were brilliant. McConaughey did a little better job handling the emotions of a father with the responsibilities of a team leader and the savior of mankind. His performance was outstanding. Hathaway was good, decent, without a single word that can be said against her, but for a movie like this, that is almost completely on the shoulders of the actors, she should have done more. The others did a good job, particularly Casey Affleck who's character was a grand comparison to Chastain's. The music given it was done by the mastermind Hans Zimmer was spectacular. Just the right notes, just the right timing, just the right music. His understanding of what movies should sound like is amazing. All in all, Interstellar is a magnificent movie. It is a type of movie Nolan does best. It has all the elements of being a classic like Kubrick's 2001: a space odyssey, it comes really close to being the new space odyssey, and it will not perish with time. Still, this might be a bit too much for the average moviegoer, a lot has to be digested here, it is not a simple or easy movie to watch. But, if your braincells don't shut off and you don't expect another Die Hard movie, you will appreciate this masterpiece."
Interstellar,11-Nov-14,"The most amazing thing about this movie is its pioneering spirit. They look at night sky and see a map of foreign worlds that need to be visited. The movie presents lot of mysteries of the world in visually fascinating way. Those robots there are amazing as well, complete opposite of Marvin from Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. I love them. The emotional layer is as great as it gets. You may very well find yourself crying possibly more than once. Finally the imagination was mind blowing rolling around the edges of the things you are yet willing to accept as possible. It all feels very real like you are right there travelling across the Universe encountering strangest parts of physics."
Interstellar,13-Nov-14,"chris Nolan a delivered another original story with with less special effects its more old school stuff with flight simulators done instead of geeen screens with space painted on the outside everything you see in this movie is real as your going to get so here starts the story of a farmer called cooper played by Matthew mconnaughey another Oscar performance who was a N.A.S.A pilot and his family he finds out that there is a problem with earth food sources and stumbles upon a plan to save earth and t leave earth for another world with his daughter he loves and his daughter tuned into other worldly scientific things that I wont explain you have to see this to understand the films relevance on finding a solution to the worlds problems there is a solution in here house were signs are there but I wont make sense until the end he has really turned the corner in his career what a RenascenceFirst of all, it is incredibly beautiful to watch. Honestly, it was so beautiful that I felt like I was sucked into the movie. The way Nolan decided to show some scenes really remind me of contact and parts of inception you see in this movie ca feel the talent of Christopher Nolan, just by looking at the way it is filmed. The techniques he used contribute to create that visual environment in a believable way.The sound environment is just mesmerizing. It is a very important part of the movie, because some scenes take place in space, and Noland just found the right way to use sound. The soundtrack (made by the great Hans Zimmer) is breathtaking, epic, amazing, unreal. I could find a lot more adjectives to qualify it, but you have to hear it to understand how epic they are. you think how loud this film is you think you ware a astronautMatthew, In this movie... Well, he is the movie. he orchestrates this film that everybody else feeds of his power so much that everyone around him gets better. But Matthew is just what was needed to feel the human part of the story (which is very important in Interstellar). He is capable of making us feel so many different emotions all along the story, as a father, as a human. Anne Hathaway was very convincing, all together the actors managed to create some harmony, which makes the human interactions credible. Caine, Chastaing and Affleck are a perfect choice. And then there is... The special guest who is mischievous in a minor role , is actually much more important than that. He proves, once again, that he is a great actor. Watch and see. and a sarcastic computer really a bit bizarre in space but this computer does come in handy in a important scene And finally, the scenario/story. I won't spoil anything here; I'll just try to convince you how great it is. Nolan is known to revolutionize everything when he tries a new genre in cinema. Well, once again he did it. With The Dark Knight he revolutionized the superhero genre. With Interstellar he's revolutionizing the sci-fi genre in cinema. he worked with a physicist in gravitational physics and astrophysics to help him with this movie. And we can feel and see just as Spielberg did in the 80s Nolan is doing it now Today, Nolan is laying the new foundations of the genre in cinema, proving that cinema is still at the beginning of what can be done (brace yourselves my friends, we have not seen anything yet). Why? Well, simply because we only know a few things about space, some things can't be proved for the moment, so we can use theory, and make the best of it. That is exactly what Nolan did. He used theories that exist today, and made a movie about mankind, about pioneers, about humanity, about us.whole journey that they thought was fraught with danger and the unknown as they have received messages from across time and space to realize that they had the answers after all it was just his daughter love to figure out what the lead scientist life work (Michael Caine) was about My rating for this movie can only be a 10,this film does not feel like 3hrs of moving space enthralling epic masterpiece with a beating heart of love and time and bending space time from a to b to meet his family across the universe This is the sci-fi movie of the decade, and probably the best movie Nolan ever made.if you like thinking about logic you might just come way thinking that this earth can be saved if we take what Nolan was taking about and not just taking the earth for granted Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night... Rage, Rage Against The Dying Of The Light."""
Interstellar,12-Nov-14,"Wowser! This Christopher Nolan film was presaged with such marketing hype that I went in with pretty low and cynical expectations. But I was frankly blown away with it.Just about everyone raves about Christopher Nolan's work, and you look back at his Filmography and it makes for a pretty impressive resume: from Memento via the (rather over-hyped imho) Dark Knight Batman series-reboot through to Inception, one of my favourite films of all time. For me, Interstellar is right up there with Inception for thought-provoking, visually spectacular and truly epic cinema.We start in familiar 'Day after Tomorrow"" territory, with mankind having in some way – not entirely explained – messed up the planet. As I understood it (and the film probably does require multiple watches with – see comments below – subtitles=on) the rather clever premise is that the world's food supplies are being progressively destroyed by a vindictive 'blight'. This delivers the double whammy of destroying mankind's provisions but also, by massive reproduction of the organism, progressively depleting the Earth's oxygen. For some reason – again, which I didn't get on first viewing – this is accompanied by massive dust storms. It is a morbid bet as to what is going to get the mid-West population first: starvation, lung disease or suffocation. Matthew McConnaughey plays the widowed Cooper, an ex-NASA drop out turned farmer given the opportunity by mission-leader Professor Brand (an excellent Michael Caine) to pilot a NASA mission. The goal is to punch through a mysterious wormhole in space where they suspect, through previous work, that a new home for mankind could be found.The first part of the film is set on and around Cooper's farm, setting in place one of the emotional wrenches at the heart of the film: that Cooper in volunteering for the mission and having to leave behind his elderly father (John Lithgow, again superb) and young children Murph (aged 10) and Tom (aged 15) whilst recognising that danger for him comes not just from the inherent risks involved but from the theory of relativity that could change everything, time-wise, for when he returns.Cooper is supported on the mission by a team of scientists including Brand's daughter played by a love-struck Anne Hathaway, who again shows she can act.To say any more would spoil what is a voyage of visual and mental discovery. (However, I would add that it is good to see that the character that plays my namesake Dr Mann (in a surprise cameo) is equally good looking! LOL).In terms of plus points, where do I start? The visuals are utterly stunning. Whilst reminiscent in places of Kubrick's ""stargate"" from 2001, the similarity is only passing. The film adds a majesty and scale to space that surpasses wonder. Elsewhere there are some interesting visual effects: this might have just been me of course, but after the dramatic launch there was something about the camera moves during the first scenes of weightlessness that made me feel genuinely nauseous.Equally stunning is Hans Zimmer's score which is epic and (in places) very VERY loud. The film certainly doesn't ""go quietly into the night""! When matching the noise of the score/choir to the sound effects in the launch sequence the combination is ear-bleedingly effective. This must be a strong contender for the soundtrack Oscar for 2014. One quibble, again 2001 related, is that Zimmer uses the last chord of Also Sprach Zarathustra in the score sufficiently often that one hopes Richard Strauss's estate receives some royalties! The acting is top notch: I've already mentioned Caine and Lithgow, but McConnaughey, Hathaway and Jessica Chastain are all great. A particular shout-out should go to Mackenzie Foy as the young Murph, who is magnetically charismatic and just brilliant in the role.Above all, Nolan's direction is exquisite. The film has a slow build on earth (which adds to the lengthy running time) but defines the characters and primes the plot perfectly. And some of the editing cuts – again, Cooper's farm departure/launch sequence overlay is a great example – are superb in building the mood and the tension.I've decided that I am an extremely tough reviewer and for me a 10 star film is a rarity indeed. Where I could have knocked off a star was in some of the dialogue on the soundtrack, which was pretty inaudible in places: McConnaughey in particular with his general mumbling and strong southern accent is indecipherable in places. I look forward to the DVD subtitles. And one of the character's dying words – delivering a key plot point in the film – was completely lost to me (but thankfully later restated). Whilst the expansive plot is highly ambitious, the end of the film, playing fast and loose with physics I fear, requires a gravity-defying suspension of belief (although I guess the same could equally be said of 2001: A Space Odyssey).However, the film has stayed so firmly lodged in my mind for 24 hours I will make a rare exception to my rating 'rule'. Overall, this is a top-notch Sci-Fi film. And a final word: PEOPLE THIS IS A MUST SEE ON THE BIG SCREEN!

Interstellar,05-Nov-14,"(((WOW)))...!!!It's almost impossible to put in words, but we have to try and give everyone what he truly deserve.In my modest opinion, Interstellar is the best Sci-Fi in human history. Believe it or not. It's the simple and the complicated, It's the usual and the different, It's the mind and the heart, It's an emotional and psychological journey through the unknown which has its own stunning visuals. It's an original story and thought-provoking masterpiece.Every single time with him, you just got crazy about his ideas, astonished by his mind games and inspired when he talks to the heart.Back then, he was an ambitious young director. And with his capabilities made his own way straight through the world. Now, he is an icon and a legend of directing. He is Christopher Nolan...Really guys, what's wrong with this guy ?!! what's going on inside his head ?!!It's our job to honor the honorable. Please, Just keep the rating UP, why ? Because Chris. and Interstellar deserve it."
Interstellar,08-Nov-14,"-Plot- The year is unknown, but most likely close to present time. The Earth is running out of resources and a group of underground NASA workers seek the help of Engineer/Astronaut turned Farmer Mr. Cooper in taking a journey across the Galaxy and through a wormhole in hopes of a future for mankind on the other side.That is the gist of the exposition of the plot. It's mostly quite clear what this movie is about through previews. On paper this sounds like a typical sci-fi plot, but Chris Nolan executes it like never before. The movie seems to be getting more mixed reviews from critics compared to his other films, and I think I have an explanation. Nolan and his team had too much faith in it's audience. The movie is full of science and dialogue strongly textured with physics theories. The talk of wormholes and Black holes are key to the movie. But I know that many will be left confused even with the explanations of what is going on to make everything in the film scientifically possible. After all, Physicist Kip Thorne was a consultant for the movie! I found it quite educational, interesting, but also over done at times. A good majority of people who watch this movie will be turned off by the abundance of scientific talk throughout the movie. I personally loved it and was never lost, but I could understand why many people were frustrated with the constant turns in the plot and overlong length. I found this movie to be amazing. Sure, at times the dialogue was hard to even understand. There was a scene where a major character is dying, and as he speaks his last words, it's almost impossible to decipher what is said. It was also almost unintentionally humorous. But that was a small price to pay and I'm sure the subtitles of the Blu Ray release will save that scene for me. The directing and cinematography are gorgeously done. The camera angles really bring the movie to life. Simple shots from the point of view of the rear of a truck or spaceship never looked so amazing. The visuals were undeniably beautiful whether the setting was in space, on the foreign planet or even the decaying Earth. The music of the film by Hans Zimmer deserves so much recognition! I will even say it was better than the score for Inception. It really increased the tension and pushed for emotional heartache in many parts of the film. There are many tense scenes that will have you holding on along with the characters in the movie and a good portion of this effect is due to the musical score! The acting was top class. Matthew M gave one of the greatest human performances in history as Mr. Cooper. I seriously think it was better than his Dallas Buyers Oscar Winning performance. I really hope he gets recognition for this. There are more than a few scenes that will make even the most cold hearted person feel like crying. He was just amazing. Anne Hathaway gave a stunning emotional performance as the flawed Bland. Jessica Chastain has a few strong moments as well. There is a scene regarding her character breaking down which will definitely make your eyes water. The supporting cast all do justice to the movie too, but Matthew and Jessica gave the best performances without a doubt.In a way, this movie resembles Inception in certain areas. Inception had a hint of relativity in it with the time differences between the dreams, the real world and limbo. Interstellar adds to that with the inclusion of a planet in the other galaxy in which every hour is equal to 7 years outside of its atmosphere. In Inception, a central character is left behind and lost in the limbo world with its major difference of time. In Interstellar, a central character is left behind in the other galaxy to find a new home while the other leaves to help the current home adjust until then. In Inception, a central character is old for a moment in limbo at the end due to the difference in time relativity. In Interstellar, the time relativity affects the entire human race as the astronauts are in the other galaxy. In both movies, the main character has left behind children and longs to be reunited. Inceptions main character doesn't want to see his children's faces until they are truly reunited. But in Interstellar, he holds on to the image of their faces as a survival tactic. This movie is full of Christopher/Jonathan Nolan-isms. Overall, I think that this movie should be seen in theaters on the big screen if you have the chance. It was a true experience. Be sure to be attentive and to clear your bladder first though. It will make you think. At times it might make you check your watch, but please endure and you will be treated to one of the most intriguing films of all time. Even if you think you didn't like the film, there is no doubt that you will be thinking about the contents of the plot and beauty of the visuals long after the credits roll."
Interstellar,05-Nov-14,"'Interstellar' takes off by constituting its soaring ambitions right at the very first few sequences of the film: humanity is struggling to survive in a barely habitable Earth, already at the brink of total destruction. Earth and its resources is down to its last few moments, but when a wormhole, a medium that enables space time-travel beyond known limits, is discovered, scientists and ordinary men gather together, to begin an exploration that would take time-traveling through different worlds, in man's desperate search for humanity's place among the stars.To fully understand 'Interstellar', its premise and its accuracy, may require repetitive thinking, research, and a certain level of intellect—perhaps the same level Nolan asked in 'Inception'. But the film does not necessarily ask its audience to right away fully understand it, instead it begs you to feel it, to experience its dilemmas and tragedies and go through the same threads of emotion tangled up within the web of humanity's last possible moments, and the relationship between a widowed father and his children already leaning toward an anticipated end. Nolan's made sure that even the film's ideas are too far-fetched and may seem resting on towering intellectual grounds, it would nonetheless connect to its audience by delivering its message through emotionally-charged tales of human relationships, tangible enough to be felt and experienced.At its core, is retired NASA engineer, Cooper (McConaughey) and his relationship with his children—most strikingly with his daughter, Murph. Cooper's emotional journey—the decision he has to make whether to leave his family behind or join the quest to search for a new habitable planet—alone, serves as an effective vessel to transport the audience from Earth, right from the moment the spacecract 'Endurance' takes off from the ground, to the unknown limits of the cosmos. McConaughey delivers a stunning and highly-commendable performance, and while I can't say its his best, as I've managed to have seen only a few of his movies, I can certainly say it's one of the best I've seen from any actor, so far, and he may be owing that to Nolan's impeccable direction. McConaughey's incredibly brilliant portrayal of a loving father places him at the center of the story. There are plenty of nail-biting sequences here depicting his devastation after the choices he needed to make and still has to take, and in each one, he never fails to effectively convey whatever emotion the sequence requires him to deliver.Nolan's mastery of his craft screams in deafening volumes through his unblemished capacity to explore and raise the layers of the film's characters and put their stories in right places and in valid highlights within the film, and that works best with the help of brilliant musical score orchestrated by the equally impeccable Hans Zimmer. Added with breath-taking cinematography and spectacular visual effects, together, these elements, make 'Interstellar' capable of weaving a human story powerful enough to intrude through our delicate emotional senses, delve into our humanity and still go beyond that. Nolan's managed to tread through the film's seemingly absurd scope and ambitions without losing focus on the one powerful element that seems to keep the film's aspects bonded together: LOVE. As chiché as it may sound, that may be the only thing that is right away understood and easily felt in the movie. There are a lot of questions raised, and each one poses another, but none of which really requires immediate answer, and by not losing grasp of the mystery of love, and the power it can deliver to make human connections tighter and even closer amidst the ever widening physical distance between the characters in the film, Nolan comes out victorious in making the audience feel and understand 'Interstellar' and have its questions answered, in a way that doesn't necessarily oblige us to just think, but also to make our emotions work as well, so we can have the experience the film wants us to go through.Sure, it can't be perfect, I myself noticed that it lacks focus with its narrative (this either because I find it hard to solve Nolan's puzzle-like construction of the story—LOL—or the narrative' s really not just that good. If you have seen Memento and Inception, the construction here is somehow similar as those two) and some respected critics even argue this one can't be Nolan's best, and I haven't seen all his works yet, either, but for me, it really isn't that hard to put this on the list of the best sci-fi movies I've seen so far. Nolan has put up together a perfect ensemble of outstanding actors, whose powerful performances, IMO, are enough to cover the flaws. Not a single bit of every actor's potential is put into waste, here; everyone has a star to shine in this universe Nolan created. Hans Zimmer's music seems to never go out of sync, in fact it almost always goes in harmony with the dramatic highlights of the film. Visual effects is never less than top-notch; the imagery presented in this film is utterly jaw-dropping, so expect to have your breath being repeatedly taken away by the frequent outburst of colors effectively employed to establish distinctions between the dimensions. All those elements are satisfyingly sufficient to create the deciding impulse needed to bring the movie to where it aims to arrive.'Interstellar' is a thought-provoking and mind-enriching motion picture, a grand and brilliantly depicted visual spectacle not bereft of human emotions, one of the best of its genre in a very long time. If this movie gets proclaimed as a classic in the coming decades, that definitely isn't going to come out as a surprise.This Christopher Nolan film deserves my 10 stars. :)"
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,15-Jan-15,"Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is probably as close as we'll come to having an experimental film released in theaters nationwide. This is one of the most innovative, original movies to come out in years. It's unlike anything I'd seen before. And yes, it is good, very good. I could not stop laughing the whole time.Onto the plot. Scott is something of a loser. He's socially awkward. He shares a mattress in a bunker-like apartment in Toronto with a sarcastic gossip king. He's in a band called the Sex Bob-Ombs, but they're really not that great. He also has a clinging, hyperactive girlfriend, ""Knives"" who's only 17- kind of a big deal when he's 22. All this changes when he dreams of a purple haired girl on roller blades. The very next day he finds out that she's real; that her name is Ramona flowers and she's the cool new girl in town. His first attempt to hook up fails miserably. His second attempt, although even more lamed brained, actually works, and they're soon an item. But now comes the bad news; to win her love, Scott must defeat her seven evil ex's. He also has an evil ex of his own. Plus, there's the matter of breaking up with Knives, and the battle of the bands is coming up!That's the setup, what follows is a hilarious romantic comedy punctuated by a series of completely over-the-top video game style fight scenes. Stylistically, I'd have to call them a cross between Sin City, Street Fighter and Viewtiful Joe. Each of the ex's has their own unique fighting style and their own super powers, such as vegan-powered telekinesis or summoning an army of stunt doubles. Often you hear martial arts movies criticized because the action is obviously computer aided. Here, that's the whole point.The movie's humor comes not only from the sheer ridiculousness of the situations, but also from the characters' reactions to them. After one of the ex's has flown in through a brick wall and battled Scott in the middle of a concert, everyone is just kind of weirded out. They don't act like nothing has happened, which would make it hard for the audience to suspend their disbelief, nor do they run screaming for the police, which would only complicate matters.Comedic effect is also generated through the use of deadpan dialog. For instance, when Knives confesses that she's never kissed a boy before, Scott replies, with a straight face ""It's okay, neither have I."" Or the band's self-introduction, ""We're the Sex Bob-Ombs and we're here to make you all sad and depressed and stuff.The movie also pokes gentle fun at hipster subculture with the way that Ramona has thirty plus flavors of tea, or how Scott's roommate is always texting. There are also quirky touches like one girl who can bleep herself out, much to Scott's amazement, and a scene when the intro from Seinfeld plays after the characters enter the apartment, and canned laughter follows every line.The editing and structure are highly non-traditional, with heavy use of dreams, daydreams, montages, animated flashbacks and asides, and chapter titles introducing segments. The visuals are impressive and very imaginative, such as the way that flashes of color accompany the playing of any musical instrument, allowing you to see the sound. Speaking of which, the sound is another high point, not only the energetic, rock fueled sound track, but also the sound effects taken from classic games like Mario and Zelda.Scott Pilgrim vs. the World succeeds in telling an offbeat story, providing interesting characters, and in producing lots of laughs. Other than a couple of too-obvious puns, I honestly can't think of anything wrong with this movie. I would highly recommend it to anyone in their teens or twenties. Four stars."
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,28-Jul-18,"Very fun film with loads of story lines, adventure and fantasy.This is one rare creative film that almost has it all.For something different check this out!"
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,20-Aug-18,"Action, beauty, women, comedy, scenery, special effects and hilarious zaniness coupled with imaginative modern and contemporary zeitgeist. What a film"
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,04-Jul-19,"What else do you want? Great film. The type of extraordinary film that draws one to the cinema. I own the DVD and it is getting a workout. The fantasy, the jokes, the romance, the legs, the feminine hair.
Yeah. I am a fan."
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,15-Apr-11,"Scott Pilgrim versus the World is a Canadian romantic comedy and musical based on the comic books by Bryan Lee O'Malley. Scott Pilgrim is a 22y.o teen-age-looking insecure guy and guitarist who plays in a rock band called Sex Bom-omb and is going out with a minor high-school Chinese girl, Knives. He seems content until he has a dream about a girl. She happens to appear in his real world in the form of Ramona, the ever-changing-hair-colour American recently moved to Toronto. Scott is over the moon, but he has to face his own personal demons, break up with sweet Knives and fight for Ramona's love against her seven exes.Scott Pilgrim is one of the most refreshing teen-sophomore movies produced in the last years, and one the best movies of 2010. The movie is cute, funny, entertaining, has great characters, a terrific soundtrack and stunning visuals. The story is presented as in a video-game in which the main characters are the players, and their lives is the game. The issues regarding relationships are masqueraded by the video-game approach, but they have depth. Unlike many other movies focusing on the emotional challenges of very young people, sex is not the focus, although it does not avoid it either. The movie focus on how difficult is to make a relationship work when you fall in love whit people who already have an emotional baggage and you are insecure about yourself. Scott's fights against Ramona's exes are just a metaphoric way of putting it. Moreover, the emotions of the girl are not the focus here, but the emotions of a young man who is not obsessed with sex. How do you get a girl who has an emotional baggage when you are not an over-confident guy, your dream girl is uber-cool, and her exes were brilliant guys? The good thing is that any of this is boringly presented. On the contrary, the movie is lots of fun and does not take itself seriously.All the actors are great in their roles: Michael Cera as Scott, Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Ramona Flowers, Ellen Wong as Knives Chau; Mark Webber, Johnny Simmons and Alison Pill as the other band members Stephen, Young and Kim. Kieran Culkin is Scott's confident grounded gay Wallace Wells, Anna Kendrick as the know it all Scott's sister Stacey, and Jason Schwartzman as the revolting Gideon Graves. However, Cera really shines in this movie, in part because his physique really portraits the character from the start.The visuals of the movie are stunning, the camera's movement, the video-game and comic use of the screen adding to the freshness and originality of the film. The fights wit the exes are extremely funny and witty. I specially liked the fight with the Vegan ex-boyfriend, which is hilarious. Also visually stunning is the musical competition between Scott's rock band and the techno Asian twins band.The music is truly terrific. An extra bonus to a great script.Scott Pilgrim vs the Wold movie is not only well done but done with passion, a project cherished by the whole team and by director Edgar Wright.The movie has freshness, soul and a special something that stays with you longer after you've seen it! It is miles away from any other young people romantic comedy lately made."
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,24-Jul-10,"The tagline for this film is ""An Epic of Epic Epicness"" and I couldn't agree more. After waiting in line for 3 hours after last night's Comic-Con and finally being sat in the gorgeous Balboa Theater, I didn't know what to expect. I loved the comics and the previews looked faithful. The moment the movie starts (literally; the Universal logo and theme are 8-bit) you are thrown into a comic book atmosphere with video game references aplenty.The plot revolves around Scott Pilgrim needing to defeat the 7 Evil Exes of Ramona Flowers in order to date her and it is a harrowing sequence of battles. Each fight is crazier than the last and some are used purely for comedy, not excitement. Almost every other line is a punchline and they all work. References to TV shows, video games and comics (just like a 20-something's life would include) are everywhere and if you accept the concept of the plot, it all feels natural.While the audience might've been biased (we held a 10-minute standing ovation for Edgar Wright when the movie finished) there's no denying that it's an excellent film. Edgar Wright has an uncanny sense of comic timing with edits and sound cues to make the picture tight and focused when it's looking for laughs.I can't imagine a mainstream theater erupting in applause and laughter like ours did but make no mistake; this a crowd pleaser and the MOST enjoyable film I've seen in years. Don't hesitate to watch this masterpiece in a theater near you."
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,05-Jul-20,The effects are really fun and full of vivid imagination and it is fine because it feels like a competition and hurdles and the viewer is right there alongside them. Will they get to the final stage?
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,13-Jun-20,"There is some good fantasy, cool special effects and thin pretty girls who show a little bit of their attractive bodies.
More than that this film is original. I don't know what else i could compare this to. In a competitive area there is a grand event and it takes my breath away."
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,02-Jul-19,"What more could anyone want??Action, fantasy, flaunting thin babes, different realities and did I mention hot chicks? Yes, stay away if you like superior realities. Otherwise, this is why I purchase DVDs."
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,09-Dec-10,"I came to this films with no preconceptions of it as a movie and I have to say I am glad. I guess I was expecting another Michael Cera movie about some dopey kid in love. And thats what it is ... but done in a unusually great way. For anyone under 25 brought up on gaming (I am 30 and not) this will be just brilliant. The style of the movie with its ""end of level baddies"", game-play set-up and visuals are a welcome and refreshing twist on what could have been a hum-drum movie. The music rocked, the comedy was fast, slick and laugh out loud ... I'd definitely recommend this to my friends looking for something that little bit special."
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,28-Jun-20,"Really wish people would stop whining about these scarce entertaining films. This is a great film with superb effects and dreamy girls that I can actually fantasize about.
Adds up very nicely."
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,18-Aug-10,"This is truly a brilliant, refreshing movie. I must say that I didn't quite know what to expect but except that I thought this movie was for teenagers and I was terribly wrong. I am 40 years old and I TRULY enjoyed this movie and it had a clear story line that targeted more than just teenagers. In addition, I saw every age group, race, gender in the screening that I attended which was impressive and we all were jumping and laughing at every scene as if we were all teenagers. I truly left the movie saying that "" I cant wait to see more films put out by ""Oni Productions/Closed on Mondays "". Well done !!!!!"
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,22-Jun-10,"I was lucky enough too see this film during a test preview to an audience that weren't told what we were about too see. I was honestly expecting some odd film that really needed a lot of help but i was pleasantly surprised with how great this movie was.The movie had everyone laughing, and i mean everyone, I've been too almost every Wright film and somehow the audience wasn't as amused as i was, but this time everyone loved it. I've never heard so much laughter in one cinema.The jokes were fast and although silly, they weren't stupid which made for quite an enjoyable film. Wright's trademark quick cuts, and simple comedy made this film, i personally think if it were directed by anyone else it wouldn't have had the same effect.The characters were well written and performed, every individual character fitted perfectly. The film had many scenes that were quite pointless but still quite funny for example the Seinfeld scene.Apparently its based on a comic book series? I've never heard of them before but i certainly will look out for them now. If you're a fan of Edgar Wrights films or just good silly humour you will love this film.Great comedy, definitely the best of 2010 8/10 Morgan"
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,02-Nov-19,"This film has everything. Violence, action, fantasy, pretty girls who spread it and does not stop delivering from start to finish."
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,12-Nov-10,"Teenager problems (find yourself, get real, etc.) might not give anything to people considering themselves mayor adults, but consider this is a movie built on arcade video gaming motifs, I don't think it concerns mayor adults at all in the first place. I for one did not necessarily long for dark moral drama in this particular movie at all, I think the story was just about right for this movie, but you decide, if this is childish watch Haneke.Now for the rest: Surprisingly, Scott Pilgrim features the best martial arts scenes in years. Every fight is choreographed and executed in the most awesome ways and the fact that it's not Jet Lee pulling off these moves makes it even more fun to watch. And you get the fights absolutely frequently which is really, really satisfying. The editing is incredibly skillful as probably the most crucial element that makes this work. It gives the movie an incredible rhythm, reaching new levels of dynamism and the use of CGI and the visual design is plain fantastic. The amount of creativity put into this part is mind- blowing, resulting genuine and most original style. The cast is cool and I don't think anyone should look for academy material here. I liked these kids and they suit the movie.So, all together I found Scott Pilgrim being one of the most original, exciting and fun productions I've seen in my life. As a huge fan of things like fighting games, comics, or martial arts anime I felt satisfied to a point of screaming 'awesome' out loud after 30 minutes into the movie. Though people who never played Street Fighter or kept crossing fingers for Goku and friends yelling 'kamehameha' as evil bosses get pulverized by energy beams might not really get what Scott Pilgrim is about, it's very hard to deny the originality featured and the creative and professional qualities of the way it's executed.Fantastic! 8/10"
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,12-Oct-19,"It is a video game-related film with zany moments, funny scenes, sexy girls and one cool main character. This one can be re-watched."
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,26-Nov-12,"I have a feeling that many young people would go ape for ""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"". It involves both young people, and its video game elements will be greatly appealing to youths. However, I think older people (like myself) will be somewhat let down by the movie.Before I get to criticizing the movie, let me say that I did feel the movie had SOME positive elements. The visual effects are top notch, successfully crossing live action with what you might see in a video game. There are also a lot of small touches here and there that are amusing, like defeated opponents transforming into coins.The visual look of the movie combined with those small touches ALMOST makes up for the flaws in the movie. The source of all the flaws is the same: the script. The script is really inadequate in a number of areas. The biggest flaw is that except for the character of Knives, NONE of the characters are sympathetic or appealing. They come across as thoughtless and kind of dumb, especially the title figure. Another script problem is that much of the movie consists of it repeating several times stuff that has already happened. The movie becomes monotonous after a while. Also, the ending is very frustrating, with Scott (in my opinion) choosing the wrong person to be with.I have not read the graphic novel series this movie is based on, but my guess is based on its length, a LOT of character development and story was cut out in order to make the movie last a little under two hours. So if you have a choice, I would advise you read the multi-part graphic novel instead of seeing this movie."
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,30-Nov-11,"Scott Pilgram, a comic series unlike any other, is brought to insane life onto the big screen. When I first heard about this, I dismissed it as some lame movie, but to my surprise it isn't. This is one of the best movies with the word ""versus"" in the history of cinema. It's so absolutely mind-blowing that I can't tell if the author of the comics was tripping on acid when he made this.Now on to the plot: Meet Scott Pilgram, a teenage boy who has his own rock band, been in a few relationships, lives in an apartment with a homosexual roommate, and happens to be the best fighter in town. When he meets a mysterious hair-color-changing girl named Ramona, Scott suddenly falls in love. However, to be with Ramona, he has to defeat her seven evil ex's, each with their own skills and powers, in awesome and hilarious video game style brawls to the death.All I can say is that this film is pure freaking genius. Action-packed and incredibly stupid (in a good way). I wish I had fights like these, then my life would be complete! All the evil ex's are delightfully despicable, each having their own funny little quirks. This is a wonderful movie and I recommend that you check this out."
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,23-Sep-14,"For fans of all things geeky around the world, this film is for YOU! Comedy, action, romance, video games, music; ""Scott Pilgrim vs. The World"" has everything you could ask for. It very quickly became my favourite film after watching it and I could watch it over and over again without ever getting bored of it; the same way that you could watch the same episode of Friends for the 'nth' time and find it as hilarious as the first.Though the character feels quite different to his graphic novel counterpart, Michael Cera does an excellent job as the awkward Scott, Kieran Culkin is perfect as Wallace and Mary Elizabeth Winstead plays a much more tragic version of Ramona Flowers but this change still works well.Scott Pilgrim is a must-see and it deserves more recognition. Go watch it, you'll love it."
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,12-Apr-20,"Only a audiovisual masterpiece, all aspects, editting, cast, soundtrack and photografy, and ya ramona flowers is a egirl."
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,31-Dec-18,"It's been a while since I watched it and I forgot how much I love it. If like me you're into comic books and video games, you will absolutely have an amazing time. And even if you don't, you might find it silly but the great cast, original storytelling and top notch special effects should keep you extremely entertained!"
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,25-Oct-12,"This is the perfect movie with perfect cast. I don't even like Michael Cera much, although he was fortunate enough to be in one of the most clever TV shows ever. He's become typecast, but this is one movie which breaks the mold. (Or at least it ignores it and does its own thing.) Edgar Wright has also directed the great movies ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz,"" and he doesn't disappoint with this. I haven't read the anime series this was based on, but I don't really want to, because this is so much better than it could ever be. To be completely honest, the only thing I don't like his how fast Scott's 'pee bar' empties. Nobody can pee that fast, geez.But yeah, everyone should watch this, especially video game fans."
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,05-Jun-18,"Edgar Wright is a creative genius and crafts one of the most delightful pieces of entertainment that unites a set of insanely likable, charismatic characters, a unique visual style, a truly original plot, charming dialogue, nuanced comedy, innovative editing and a soundtrack that kicks ass.The story follows Scott Pilgrim, a 22-year-old guitarist who plays in a not-so-successful band and who seems to stumble from one social misadventure to the next. He starts off dating a 17-year-old but is soon enraptured by purple haired Ramona Flowers who works in delivery service. However, to be with her, he first needs to defeat her seven evil exes. This set-up, although seemingly ridiculous, paves the way for a film that captivates the viewer with its colourful set designs, smart dialogue and of course its over-the-top, awesomely choreographed fight scenes with video game aesthetics. Despite the exaggeration, the story never feels forced or contrived. Instead, it flows amazingly naturally and the comedy never falls flat, which is certainly also due to the superb performances of the cast. I couldn't praise this film enough. ""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"" is one of these films that succeeds on every level. You see it once and immediately want to re-watch it. The creators obviously knew what they were doing and the result is a well-paced, highly entertaining film spiked with references to pop culture. It dares to be unconventional and geeky but never gets too absorbed in its references. The film knows when to be quiet and when to be loud but most of all, it doesn't take itself too seriously, granting an out of this world, two hour spectacle that couldn't be more epic."
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,29-Aug-10,"Scott Pilgrim vs. The World has made me question just how well I fit in with my generation. According to other members of my generation, it is the movie to end all movies, and the best movie... I'm sorry... most EPIC movie ever. I'm partial to The Godfather myself. Scott Pilgrim is a film that I was looking forward to as Michael Cera has made me laugh numerous times in the past, and Edgar Wright is easily one of the more talented newer directors working today. Combined with the eye-popping visual effects, I couldn't see how these things could add up to anything less than a fun and entertaining film. Fun, to a point. Entertaining? Well...Scott Pilgrim's first problem is the plot. The plot is self-conscious and repetitive, as well as overly laid back and easygoing. Scott Pilgrim has to defeat his new girlfriend's seven evil ex's. That's the whole plot, and at no point do we get the sense that anything is at stake for these characters. I know that probably shouldn't matter in an effects-driven popcorn movie, but with nothing to root for, or no suspense of any kind, I found the film to get boring after the first thirty minutes. That is approximately when the first evil ex shows up. They fight. He defeats him easily. Too easily. The fight isn't all that exciting as a result. And with six of these to go, the movie became a tedious experience before it was even halfway over.Not to say the film doesn't have it's good points. Michael Cera, though not as witty as he can be, is still somewhat likable. And while the script lacks structure of any kind, it is jam- packed with hilariously quirky dialogue and brilliant sight gags. The filmmaking is generally good throughout, and as a director Edgar Wright hasn't lost his talent. Unfortunately, the poor storyline ultimately overshadowed these elements for me. Maybe it's because I don't play video games. Maybe I just need to read the comics. Or maybe I'm just becoming less fun of a person as I mature. I want to like this movie and take the same joy from it that my generation does, but I simply can't. I'll stick to films with stories and social relevance and enjoy being the outcast. Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World gets a generous 5/10 because I feel giving it anything lower would just make me look bitter."
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,29-Aug-10,"Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera) is in his early twenties and has started dating a girl named Knives Chau (Ellen Wong) who is still in high school. The news circulates around all of his friends including his gay roommate Wallace (Kieran Culkin) and his nosey sister Stacey (Anna Kendrick). At first Scott enjoys the company of Knives. She watches his band play during their practice sessions. At a party though Scott meets who he believes is the girl of his dreams in Ramona (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). He opts to go out with Ramona instead and decides to breakup with Knives. Yet when his band is performing at a gig, Scott is confronted by one of Ramona's seven ex-boyfriends. This leads to a series of video game style fight sequences where Scott must take on each of Ramona's exes, many of which have superhuman powers of their own and defeat them so he can date her properly.Although Scott Pilgrim vs. the World has been adapted from a 2004 graphic novel series, it is to a fault like a computer game. It's been directed by Edgar Wright, who previously worked on Shaun of the Dead (2004) and Hot Fuzz (2007). He has chosen to shoot the film with an overwhelming number of visual tricks that look to have come straight from the graphic novel source and the arcades machines. When someone knocks on Scott's door the onomatopoeic words appear on the screen. When Scott kisses Ramona tiny hearts trickle out between them. During the fight scenes icons popup to reveal Scott's high scores, like an arcade game. But Wright seems too excited by these gimmicks and they are used too frequently. Rather than being charming little treats for the audience, they quickly become excessive. The film's rapid pacing is also problematic. As the director and one of the film's screenwriters Wright seems highly intent on moving through the film's opening quarter as quickly as possible, with rapid cutting hurling the audience from one scene to another. Given the speed of the first act and the array of video game aesthetics thrown in, the rest of the film desperately lacks urgency. It fires all its shots at once and then there is no momentum to build upon with any of the fight scenes, leaving the movie at a monotone rate. Scott Pilgrim already knows how to fight too so there is no character development or exposition here either. Each fight sequence feels no more significant than the last. It makes for extremely repetitive viewing, with at least three exes too many and just not enough substance.Michael Cera has potential as a comic actor but the script here does not allow him to develop anything new beyond his trademark dopey persona. Given how engaging he has been in films like Juno (2007), it is surprising how dislikeable he is here. The way that he treats Knives and gets away with it makes him less appealing as a protagonist. It does not help that Cera is forced to deliver dialogue that is entirely self- conscious in its attempts to be hip. No one has anything interesting or funny to say here. When his sister Stacey asks him if he really thought that he had a future with Ramona he replies thickly: ""Like with jetpacks?"" There is an overdose of style here and not an ounce of sincerity. A lot of the other performers are wasted too. Anna Kendrick, a talented actress from films like Twilight and Up in the Air (2009), is barely seen and no matter how cool and alternative Winstead's hair looks her character is still underwritten. It's disappointing that the exes fail to reveal anything about her past. Jason Schwartzman has only a small role as the film's central baddie and it would have been nice to see more of him in the film because he is a regularly enjoyable talent on-screen.Despite the efforts of director Edgar Wright to bombard the audience with an array of visual tricks, there is little by way of substance to be found in Scott Pilgrim vs. the World. Its computer game counterpart probably soars on its artistic flair but this film disregards too many of the basics of screen writing. It's pacing runs on a single, exhausting note and does not give enough urgency to the repetitive fight sequences. The lack of a substantial narrative here diminishes any possible depth the performances might have had too. It's so intent on being hipster cool that it forgets about keeping it real. Exit game."
The Godfather,20-Jun-14,"'The Godfather' is the pinnacle of flawless films! The first time I viewed 'The Godfather' I was in my early teens and it was the most astounding film I had ever seen, and has since then stood as my all-time favourite film. It is due to this that I have been looking forward to writing a review of this unforgettable classic. So let's start from the beginning. The film opens to four words, 'I believe in America', it's crazy to think that this simple line has become a resonant quote solely due to the impact it made on the entrance to the film's ""threshold"". This is just one of the many renowned quotes that litter the film, and believe me, there are a lot. After the first take we are then absorbed into the life of Vito Corleone, brilliantly portrayed by the Oscar- winning performance of Marlon Brando. Vito is a feared man, he is a criminal, he is a mafioso, but above all he is a respected family man, his three sons are depicted by three excellent actors, James Caan, John Cazale and Al Pacino as well as his adopted child Tom Hagen, played by Robert Duvall. The film follows Vito as he attempts to transfer his crime empire to his reluctant son, Michael. With some of the most graphic and gruesome death scenes to have ever been seen in the 1970's film industry (including a certain horse's head), 'The Godfather' epitomises how violence can be used effectively within a film. The Corleone's are some of the greatest antiheroes to have ever been seen on screen, whilst they are villains, the audience will refuse to accept that fact, Coppola does something simple and audacious, he takes the guilt out of organised crime. A film rife with beautiful cinematography, memorable musical scores and well-paced action and drama. Overall, The Godfather is one of Hollywood's greatest critical and commercial successes that gets everything right; a gangster flick that is overflowing with life, rich with emotion and subtle acting, and further blessed with amazing direction from Francis Ford Coppola. Arguably the most unforgettable masterpiece to have ever been made."
The Godfather,11-Feb-18,"This isn't just a beautifully crafted gangster film. Or an outstanding family portrait, for that matter. An amazing period piece. A character study. A lesson in filmmaking and an inspiration to generations of actors, directors, screenwriters and producers. For me, this is more: this is the definitive film. 10 stars out of 10.Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/"
The Godfather,30-Sep-05,"Rather than concentrating on everything that is great about The Godfather, a much easier way for me to judge its quality is on what is bad about it. Almost every film has something that I don't like about it, but I can honestly say that I wouldn't change anything about The Godfather. There is nothing weak about it and nothing that stands out as bad. That's why it gets ten out of ten.This is one of those films that made me wonder why I hadn't seen it earlier. The acting from everyone involved is great, Marlon Brando comes across perfectly as the head of the family, and James Caan and Al Pacino are excellent as his sons. The soundtrack by Nino Rota is also very memorable, bringing back memories of the film every time I hear it. The plot has to be excellent for it to get ten out of ten, and it is, it's far from predictable and the film is the definition of a great epic.The film is pretty shocking in the way every death occurs almost instantaneously, and as it spans ten years so many different things happen and every minute of it is great entertainment. It's a well-made and entertaining film that is only the first part of a trilogy, but it stands on its own as a wonderful film in its own right. If you haven't seen it, what are you waiting for? This was one acclaimed film that didn't disappoint."
The Godfather,21-Jun-08,"Tell me a movie that is more famous than this. Tell me a movie that has had more parodies spinned off its storyline than this. Tell me one movie that has been as quoted as a much as this. The answer is you can't. No movie has had as much of an impact as The Godfather has had ever since it was released.The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a cliché. His performance though was not a cliché. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake.The writing was phenomenal and breathtaking. As mentioned before there has been no movie quoted more than this. It is not even the quotes though that makes the writing in here so perfect. It is the symbolism and meaning that went into every scene. There are countless symbols, messages and lines in here that are so memorable yet it is as realistic as a movie could get.The directing by Coppola was perfect as well. Not many movies can be 3 hours and yet maintain a good level of interest from the audience like The Godfather. Coppola deserves credit for this. The symbolism and messages that went into every scene also has to do with the directing not just the writing. The movie is so well edited and strung together that the only word that could come to my mind is perfection.The cinematography and music were perfect. The score of this movie is one of the most memorable ever. If you were to hear it you could identify it right away. The cinematography was what actually really drove this movie. The Godfather seems to have this mystique to it, it gives you the feeling you are watching something truly remarkable.The horse's head, the scene of Brando running with his groceries, the coffee shop scene, ""I'll give him an offer he can't refuse"" and countless other scenes and quotes from this movie have become a part of our culture. These scenes and lines have been recycled over and over again in comedies, commercials, etc. that it is impossible to avoid the greatness of The Godfather. The Godfather is like a disease once you see it you fall in love with it. I don't know if it is the greatest movie ever but it is definitely the most iconic film ever made."
The Godfather,23-Feb-20,"One of the best films of all time, an absolute masterpiece. The Godfather is arguably the best gangster drama as well as setting the standard for cinema."
The Godfather,01-Apr-19,"It is now past 1 PM and I just finished watching Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"". I should probably go to bed. It's late and tomorrow I have to wake up a bit early. But not early enough to postpone writing these lines. Now that I have seen it three times, the opportunity of sharing my thoughts and refreshed insights are too much of a good offer to sit on. So, bear with me.This film works so well because it takes place in an underworld in which we are so embedded that we do not even observe it. Coppola puts us straight in the smack-dab center of what is, admittedly, a society made by criminals for criminals. It is also the reason why it's so welcoming. We are surrounded by its inhabitants--cold-blooded murderers, men who see crime like a 9 to 5 job masquerading as honorable men. And I do mean men. From the outside, we would only witness the horrifying, disturbing manifestations of their well-thought out actions.But it goes even deeper than that. It all revolves around the Corleone family led by Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). He is the most honest of these men, sitting right on the edge. But for people like him, who do not fully embrace this world, it's not easy. He avoids conflict until it is absolutely necessary. He is a man defined by moral principles. There is a scene at the beginning, in which, during his daughter's wedding day, one of his associates, Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana) practices his speech that he is going to give to the Don when he meets him. The scene with these two is funny and almost adorable. I could not help but sympathize both of them only to realize that I am feeling warmth for two mobsters. Not to even mention that Lenny Montana was an actual mob hit-man and that he was actually nervous as he said that line.The more I watched the more I realized just how incredibly complex and ruthless this society is and how it has the power to corrupt anyone to come in contact with it. The best example is Corleone's youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino). He returns home for his sister's wedding as a war hero dressed the part with his long-time girlfriend, Kay Adams (Diane Keaton). At first, he avoids this underworld, but necessity, first-hand exposure and just its sheer devilish appealing nature draws him in. As we get further in the film, the change is shocking and every outsider who ever got close to him is tainted in one way or another. If they survive it, they are drawn in as well as we are as viewers.Inside, Coppola exposes the family to us fully, with a bold personal approach and we witness every discussion, every methodically calculated choice. Crime is done simply because it is the nature of their business, and we are put on a chair alongside them, so we easily relate. For us, they are the good guys, the rival families are the bad guys. This is the greatest feat this film managed to pull off--set apart good guys and bad guys in a world filled with bad guys.This is a film of unmatched subtlety. No other movie sustains itself as good. No other film is done with such precision, attention and completeness. There are many layers which I probably missed and maybe will never notice. But I felt them. What director Francis Ford Coppola and his partner in crime (poor choice of words, sorry) Mario Puzo did is nothing short of a timeless piece of reference cinema whose influence is not based on reinventing the wheel, but rather perfecting it to the absolute maximum.Most masterpieces are remembered for their historical contributions. ""Citizen Kane"" brought the biggest step-up to the art form, the same things did ""Gone With the Wind"" or ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". ""The Godfather"" is one of the few films that will be remembered simply because they are that good and I cannot possibly imagine a greater achievement."
The Godfather,05-Mar-02,"The Godfather is one of the few films in which I personally did not find any significant weakness even after many viewings. From the direction, to the acting, to the storyline, to the score, The Godfather has the word classic written all over, and it really is not much of a surprise that it is now considered by many one of the top five movies of all time. Perhaps when it comes to cinematic techniques The Godfather has not been as revolutionary as Citizen Kane, but its influence on motion pictures is comparable. Rarely a movie has defined or re-defined a genre as much as this one did for ""gangster movies"", but its influence goes well beyond that.The Godfather's influence has been so big through the years that elements of it can be found in virtually every ""organized crime film"" nowadays; almost every comedy featuring a gangster in the last few years has spoofed something in The Godfather. The Italian-American old mobster a-la Don Vito Corleone has become one of the most established figures in the public's imagination.But to say that The Godfather is simply ""influential"" is to diminish its true qualities, and so is to describe it simply as ""a movie about gangsters"". The Mafia is certainly the main focus the story revolves around (despite the fact that the word is never mentioned), but although the movie never tries to forcedly insert separate subjects it contains an amount of psychological and social subtexts that cannot be overlooked. Considerations on how the social environments changes us, on how moral values appear different from different point of views, on how violence can destroy a human soul, and on how power can corrupt an individual are deeply blended into a story that stays practically always true to complete realism, and the result is a picture of astonishing efficacy and believability.As good as the direction and the story are, it would be unfair not to consider the major role that the actors' performances had in the cinematic triumph that was The Godfather. Praised by many as the best cast to ever appear in an American movie, all the cast in The Godfather succeeds in portraying complex, three-dimensional characters without ever making a slip. The exceptional portrayals of Don Vito and Michael Corleone respectively by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, the performances by Robert Duvall, James Caan and Diane Keaton as Tom Hagen, Santino Corleone and Kay Adams, the ruthless Virgil Sollozzo played by Al Lettieri -- as well as more than a few other roles -- are all perfect for the movie, and they all succeed in making us believe these are real people, not just actors. We are not watching a central character and a bunch of incomplete figures that revolve around him: although Michael Corleone is the character that gets the most screen time, everybody is the center of this world his own way. The movie makes it possible for the viewers to identify with different characters and to observe how their personality and story fits in, and it does it much more effectively than many bloated multiple-storyline movies that came out in the last few years.The movie opens on the wedding of Don Vito Corleone's daughter, Connie (Talia Shire). Don Corleone is a powerful man, and it was not without the use of violence that he achieved this position during the course of his life. The wedding scene gives a perfect setting of where and how the Don's power extends; from the regular worker in a neighborhood, to the immensely popular singer, to the friends in politics and right to the ruthless killer, Don Corleone has links to people ready to ask him favors and to pay him back. Some are trustworthy, some are not, but thanks to his intelligence and intuit the Don can almost always distinguish the two.However, this is 1946, times are changing, and to many of the younger people working in the crime business, Don Corleone's ideas are becoming obsolete. The Don believes that the new trend in the business, narcotics, is too dangerous and the families dealing with it would eventually end up self-destroying; while his family had deals in alcohol and gambling for a long time, part of the Government and law enforcement was ready to close one eye. Drugs are another thing.To this day, Don Corleone was able to keep things together while maintaining his economic and political power, but things will brutally change when a powerful drug dealer name Sollozzo enters the picture. The refusal of Don Corleone to cooperate with Sollozzo, and a weakness immediately spotted by the latter, will ignite a war that will cost many lives, and that will see Michael Corleone, Vito's younger son and the one who never wanted to take part in the family business, lose his ""innocence"" and transform into a gangster as ruthless as the people he initially stood up against.I purposely decided not to spoil much about the plot because I believe that the film is perfectly enjoyed without knowing anything in advance, and -- believe it or not -- there are still quite a lot of people who have never seen this movie. There are multiple scenes that manage to create an incredible tension, various twists, and although like any other masterpiece The Godfather can be watched knowing the whole story beforehand and still be a phenomenal experience, I believe it is always a pleasure to see it for the first time and enjoy its multiple climaxes. Besides, to outline such complicated characters and such an emotionally intense story in a short review like this one would be inadmissible.There has been much speculation on how the events in The Godfather novel written by Mario Puzo, the book the film is based on, could be an exposé of true facts. Many believe that the character of Johnny Fontane , for instance, was based on Frank Sinatra's real life, and many of the other characters were modeled after real people. I won't go into that: frankly, I have no idea whether these voices are reliable, although the Frank Sinatra reference seems obviously quite believable.The cinematography of The Godfather is dark and tasteful, and colors are used perfectly to give a true feel of the era it is set in. There is a fair amount of violence, though rarely gratuitous.The Godfather certainly doesn't need my recommendation. The film is universally considered one of the best of all time, and the performances by Pacino and Brando alone is the stuff of legends."
The Godfather,10-Oct-17,"One of the great movies of its time. Before, and even now is admire as one of the most classic and greatest films of all time. And I agree. I remember when I first watched it I never thought that Sonny would be the one killed, and Michael being the one taking over the family, and ruling with an iron fist. I have to watch at least one or two times a year."
The Godfather,14-Oct-06,"This is a masterpiece. A timeless masterpiece. Initially, I didn't like this film all that much - I found it rather over-hyped and boring. This was until the advent of DVD, which gave me the feature I needed for this sort of film: subtitles. Once I switched them on and heard (read) every last word of Brando's ramblings and other characters ramblings, I grew a true appreciation for this epic.To make a true epic, you need all of three following ingredients working in near perfect harmony. For screenwriters who come across this, take the following pointers on board: 1) Contrasting Characters: Good films have some character distinction, but most fall rather flat because the core of each character is the same.Of course, there are exceptions to rule (ie... where you want mono-tonal characters... aka matrix; or where you want outlandish contrasts... aka The Fifth Element), but ultimately, this is what makes films deep, meaningful and grand. Consider the contrasts between the Don's children. Michael is rather cool, rational and collected, whereas Sonny is more hot-headed, spontaneous and simple minded. But simply having these contrasts is not nearly enough. What you really need to do is to develop these characters - place them in situations - and then dwell on how their character impacts on the situation they're put in. The Godfather is a terrific example of how to pull this off. While many try to do this in screenplays, most lose the plot and create character obscurities that stretch credibility.2) Transformation: The central character(s) must undergo a transformation, resulting in them being almost unrecognizable by the end of the film. By putting them into situations, the character's character must not only influence the outcome of the situation; it must also have a lasting impact on the character. Consider Michael at the wedding and compare that to the Michael we see at the end of the film. Again, many films try, but most fail because they come up with unreal (literally, not praisingly) or simply moronic transformations (eg, Wall Street).3) Patience: Men in Black 2 was an astounding film for one simple reason - it was an entire film squashed into about 70 minutes. It was not much longer than an episode of ER or Buffy. I certainly hope the new goal of Hollywood isn't to make films as short as possible.All the great ones spend time - time developing characters, family life, growth, patience with the story telling in general. This is the key (provided that the story isn't mind-numbingly boring). Dances with Wolves, Heat.. and so on are very patient but top-class films. While studios may be lukewarm on the idea of longer films, they are worth it if you have a ripper story to base it on.I feel that this film has not dated all that much and has tremendous re-watch-ability."
The Godfather,22-Jan-20,"The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a cliché. His performance though was not a cliché. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake.The writing was phenomenal and breathtaking. As mentioned before there has been no movie quoted more than this. It is not even the quotes though that makes the writing in here so perfect. It is the symbolism and meaning that went into every scene. There are countless symbols, messages and lines in here that are so memorable yet it is as realistic as a movie could get."
The Godfather,27-Feb-19,"The directing by Coppola was perfect as well. Not many movies can be 3 hours and yet maintain a good level of interest from the audience like The Godfather. Coppola deserves credit for this. The symbolism and messages that went into every scene also has to do with the directing not just the writing. The movie is so well edited and strung together that the only word that could come to my mind is perfection.The cinematography and music were perfect. The score of this movie is one of the most memorable ever. If you were to hear it you could identify it right away. The cinematography was what actually really drove this movie. The Godfather seems to have this mystique to it, it gives you the feeling you are watching something truly remarkable."
The Godfather,09-Jul-06,"I love this movie and all of the GF movies. I see something new every time I have seen it (countless, truly). The story of tragedy and (little) comedy that exists in this film is easily understood by people all over the world. This film has been called an American story however I have met others who have seen this movie in other languages and they seem to have the same love and appreciation for it that I do. I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people. This could be attributed to the method in which it was filmed. At many parts of the film I can still find myself feeling the emotions conveyed in the film. I never tire of appreciating this film. I thank God that FFC is an American treasure. We are fortunate to have him."
The Godfather,25-Dec-02,"This is by far the best movie ever to give a portrait organized crime, this movie goes deep inside and shows it all inside out..With superb acting by especially Al Pacino as Mike Corleone and Marlon Brando as Don Vito corleone this movie shows how one of the head mafia families in New York works, it gives a detailed picture of how their business runs and what kinda chances they got to take on their business, for example their denial to step inside the narcotic business brings on alot of troubles, but also it shows what kinda sacrifices they make, every day could be their last day..Al Pacino shines above all in this movie, as the smart boy of the family he returns after fighting a war for his country, at that time not involved in the family business, but it doesn't take long before the war breaks lose and he see no other ways than to step in and fight for his family.This is definetely a ""must see"" masterpiece."
The Godfather,29-Jun-08,"""The Godfather"" simply put, is one of the greatest films of all time. The script is thee best I've ever read. The direction is flawless. The acting may very well have the best ensemble cast in any movie I've ever seen or will ever see. It's also one of the most precise and intricate films I've ever come across as writer, Mario Puzo brings out some of the most hidden and guarded secrets of the underground world ever captured on film. Watching ""The Godfather,"" is like watching cinematic art. Francis Ford Coppola's direction is what brings this film, that's so ambitious and so grand, down to earth with precision direction as he handles each and every scene with such care. The film starts with a black screen and an opening monologue from an undertaker. As the man starts talking about honor, family, respect, and justice we are pulled right in on his luminous eyes as he stands in near darkness. He begs for justice since the American system has failed him. He goes to Don Corleone (Marlon Brando) for justice. Don Vito is the man of power. He's the one who pulls all the strings and watches his puppets dance from behind the stage and out of sight; untouchable, or so we think. Some of the greatest moments in the film- and very intentional to show the distinguishable difference between Michael and Vito- are of Vito crying over his son, Sonny's (James Caan), death. When Michael learns of the news, he has little reaction. Two of the most emotionally powerful scenes in the film are from the cause of a loved one that has died long before he should have, and they come from Brando. As Vito stands over the body of his son he nearly breaks down. There is clash of feelings between the two men that are never conflicting, but compared. The film opens during the wedding of Don Vito' daughter, Connie (Talia Shire), and we see just how strong the bond of family really is. You have the family dancing with each other, drinking, laughing, and sitting next to each other to show how close they are, then we see some of the outsiders such as the Barzini family, and surprisingly Michael (Al Pacino) along with his girlfriend Kay (Diane Keaton) on the outskirts without much interaction. Michael seems almost out of place as if he is the adopted son and Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) is more apart of the family than he is. His opening words are to Kay, and they include, ""That's my family, Kay. That's not me."" We get the feeling that Michael's nearly ashamed of the stigma that goes along with his last name: This is what makes Al Pacino' role- significantly- the hardest performance in the entire film to portray. He's the one doing all the heavy lifting as he has to go from outsider and completely against the family's actions and businesses to, by films end, head of the family. Brando has the teary eyed moments that actors live for, but Michael is too cold for that. Never for a second as he gradually comes to power do we think this turn is ridiculous or laughable, and in lesser hands it very easily could have been. The final act of the film is loaded with plot points as decisions are made left and right as the film becomes visually and emotionally captivating. As the film draws to an end, Michael has gained half of the power of the family and makes most of the decisions. He's treated, not with respect, but as an outsider, too high ranking for his experience. The Corleone family is on the brink of disaster and losing everything, yet we never get that feeling. We see the two leader's confidence and we keep our confidence in them, even if the other family members doubt their decisions. Michael goes to Las Vegas and makes Moe Greene an offer he can't refuse. Then he refuses. This is Pacino' shinning moment in the film. There's no screaming or the hoopla that goes along with his name. After he treats Moe Greene like utter garbage, Fredo (John Cazale) get's upset and starts barking at him. Coppola is perfectly on his game here, too, as we watch from Fredo's height, looking down on Michael who sits in a chair as he coldly looks up with his radiating eyes, that have so much going on behind them, and simply says, ""Fredo, don't ever take sides with anyone against family again. Ever.""That's some serious foreshadowing for the second film, and only after watching the second film can you go back and appreciate what Pacino and Coppola pulled off in this scene; Cazale too. We have no idea how serious Michael is. These are some of the stepping stones that make Michael's change believable. He's not quite his father- Vito has a soft spot for his children (admittedly so)- as he's capable of turning on anyone and using the line, ""It's strictly business"" when it comes to family issues. Michael's sister, Connie, calls him a ""cold hearted bastard"" at the end of the film. It's hard to find better superlatives than that, yet we still love him. The interesting thing about Pacino' performance is that he doesn't sugarcoat it. He doesn't try to make the audience love him. He plays the character as the character should be played. That's the sign of great writing; great acting; and great directing since we could have very easily seen someone try to make him likable. This crew just presents the character with all his flaws and let's us decide if we love him or hate him. Its films like ""The Godfather,"" that made me wish I had amnesia, so I could feel the same heart pounding moments over and over again."
The Godfather,06-Aug-06,"This must rank as the best film (along with part 2)of all time.An ensemble performance that has no weak spot.Particularly, John Cazale ( Fredo) and Richard Castellano ( Clemenza) give wonderfully understated performances. You just have to believe that Castellano WAS Clemenza, he brings a real touch to his role.John Cazale brings the troubled Fredo to life, and you can see the weak Fredo desperately trying to live up to the family reputation but knowing that he can never be what his father wants. The story of one man's reluctance to be drawn into the murky family business,and his gradual change through circumstance, paints a vivid picture of this violent period of US history.Do not miss this film!"
The Godfather,16-May-01,"This movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent acting, and over the top directing.  It is hard to fine a movie done this well, it is 29 years old and has aged well.  Even if the viewer does not like mafia type of movies, he or she will watch the entire film, the audiences is glued to what will happen next as the film progresses.  Its about, family, loyalty, greed, relationships, and real life.  This is a great mix, and the artistic style make the film memorable."
The Godfather,04-Jul-05,"The godfather trilogy is an exclusive set of movies that will continue to live with humanity, every generation will see them to say, ""Oh that was 10 out of 10."" If you watch them you will know that the world that lives inside the underworld is same as the one we live in except that people in underworld are so smart, in fact smartness is the only thing that can keep them there. Don Vito Caroleone's early life shown in part-II is very well done to show the Don in making, how a kid who couldn't even tell his name went on becoming a underworld don who keep most senators, judges and lawyers in his pocket. Meeting of don with the so call five families are among most impressive scenes.A saga that goes on for 9 continuous hours takes you around various walks in life of Mike (Don's younger son who become Don later), his school days, love life, personal life, family life, business life, political life and religious life. How all of these different roles Mike plays in his life and how intertwined these are.I enjoyed watching these movies so much, I wish I had seen them much before then I did. Its amazing to see how the Part-III was made 18 years later the part-I was made and everything looks so continuous if watch them together.I need not say much! The Godfather father trilogy been around for a while and everyone knows that they are great set of movies, its just the matter of when you actually get to see them.Watch them! Kudos to Francis Ford Coppola! -Vishy"
The Godfather,20-Jan-20,"A mafia masterpiece from FRANCIS FORD COPPOLA,the first part of this chronological trilogy tells the rise of MICHAEL CORLEONE in superb fashion,everything from the sets to the stellar cast is perfect to the point of almost feeling like its a fly on the wall drama,AL PACINO excels here but it is truly MARLON BRANDO that steals the show with a fantastic portrayal of an ageing head of a crime family.with a fantastic script from MARIO PUZO of SUPERMAN the movie fame this is without a doubt the best mafia story portrayed on the silver screen....if you like mafia/gangster movies this is the one that will explain why...this is a trilogy you wont forget"
The Godfather,11-May-18,"Really what more about The Godfather can I say that hasen't already been said?Everything about this movie is perfectly executed and incredibly well put together. The characters are really what added that extra depth to the film. The first character I want to bring up is Sonny. Throughout the movie, you know him as an ignorant and almost childish person, yet when he is shot and killed, you feel immediate sympathy for him. And at the same time he is a determined member of their family business and also caring when the time is needed for that trait to be exposed (ex: when Vito nearly dies in the first act). And when Vito is looking down at his dead body, you really feel for them even though someone like Vito may come across like an incredibly serious and emotionless man. But what they accomplished was, not making him another one dimensional Mafia/mob boss, but someone who legitimately cares for his family. The way they introduce him in the beginning of the film is very well conducted and shows the audience how intimidating he is and the impact he has on other people in what he says and how his word/opinion is extremely important to people. Brando is incomparable in his role and is irreplaceable as his role as Don Corleone.My favorite aspect of this movie, however, is seeing the riveting transition of Michael Corleone throughout the film. They first introduce Michael as someone who wants nothing to do with the family business, but is eventually the new Don replacing his father at the end of the film. Wow! What a transformation! He is a former Marine who is committed to living a normal, happy life with his wife Kay. However Michael eventually gets involved in the criminal empire after Vito is shot and almost killed. This leads up to the best scene, in my opinion, of the movie. Michael goes out to a restaurant with Sollozzo, the head of one of the rival families of the Corleones, the Tattaglias, in addition to Police Captain McCluskey, with intentions to kill both of them. He does after contemplating it in his head, and this is an incredibly important scene because it is the start of Michael's transition into the new Don we see at the end of the movie. It was not rushed in any way and that's another great aspect of the film. It's nearly three hours long, but it's necessary for the person watching it to be fully immersed into the story and characters. The ending is really well directed and thought out because without any explanation, you know what just happened as soon as someone kisses Michael's hand, which was shown earlier in the film but to Vito, a gesture only given to the Don. Al Pacino gave a great performance and so did every single other person in the movie. Perfect casting all around.I think one performance that is very undervalued is Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen. He plays a super important role in the movie, but is not quickly thought of by most people. He was a side character, but incorporated well in the film as the advisor for Vito, and later Michael.Many Of the characters in the movie and constantly conflicted with themselves and they display it very well. The entire story is one of the best ever put to the big screen and the praise that it's gotten over all these years are very deserving. The way they utilize lighting in the film is also very important such as every scene of Vito in his office at the beginning of the film is constantly lit dark showing the fear people feel when entering his office and the seriousness of situations involving him. This also applies to Vito's soft spoken voice demonstrating how intimidating he comes off as without screaming for example. A vast majority of the film, basically the entire 2nd and 3rd acts, with the exception of the very beginning with the wedding to go also how with the 1st act, are all lit dim, in dark tones. On the other hand, Michael, in the beginning of the film, is shown in the bright daylight outside talking with his girlfriend, an excellent contrast between him and the rest of his family.Great acting, great script, and all put into great hands that made it as amazing as it is even 40 years later.RATING: 10.0/10"
The Godfather,24-Feb-01,"""The Godfather"" is a huge piece of film entertaining, involving sentiment, nostalgia, filial affection, pride, integrity, loyalty, corruption, honor, betrayal and crime... Within weeks of its release, it was clearly a blockbuster, a cinematic phenomenon, an exquisite Mafia epic with outstanding performances... Coppola got everything right, creating a landmark in American cinema...His film acutely details the inner workings of the criminal ""families,"" and the ruthlessness of those in organized crime, but also examines their steadfast loyalty, love for blood relations, and code of ethics... Coppola and Puzo subtly weave a complex narrative with themes of hypocrisy, power, and corruption which stands as a pulsating reflection of our uncertain times...

Brando's Don Corleone is the moral center of the film: a tough, wise, feared old Sicilian who has risen to become an all powerful leader in an empire of Italian-American organized crime...While crime may be the first image that comes into one's mind in the film, violence plays a vital part in this complicated tale... Brando is the head of one of the five families who are said to control the Mafia in the area of New York... He is opposed to any involvement in drugs, and refuses to risk his political contacts and prestige for such putrefied money... He is behind the time but he understands that society is not alarmed by ""liquor, gambling, and even women..."" He is also a loving family man... His sons, relatives and friends are part of his operations... He despises displays of weakness... He understands the strength of power and his wordless sympathy for Michael when he is forced to assume the ""sovereignty."" In the outdoor garden, father and son are affectionate to each other, but cannot express their emotions openly...The Corleones are a warm, close family and the motion picture (with l0 Oscar Nominations) shows the flavor of Italian-American home life... Don Corleone is an undisputed patriarch, and as played by Brando, he has almost the manner of a religious leader... His voice is quite and rasping, his chin stands as a symbol of his authority, and men kisses his hand as they ask for his favors... He is a charismatic leader and his eyes reflect his kind heart as his implacability...Pacino's gradual and subtle transformation is the heart of the film... From a gentle man to one of the most cunning, ruthless, and cold-blooded man ever to come on the screen, he has learned from his father never to talk in front of outsiders and always keep his own counsel... His commandment ""Never to take sides against the Family.""

In the same time Coppola introduces us to his large cast of characters:Sonny (James Caan), the rough, hot-headed impulsive kid who never really grew up; Fredo (John Cazale), the troubled, shy, weak young man who can't seem to do anything right; Tom (Robert Duvall), the right-hand man, the legal adviser and adopted son to the Godfather steady, reliable, always thinking, always controlled; Connie (Talia Shire), the battered wife and rebellious sister, who achieves and promotes the movie's most horrific scene; Johnny Fontane (Al Martine), the idol star whose tears set up the shocking moment when a movie ""big shot"" named Jack Woltz (John Marley) finds himself in an horrifying pool of blood; Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana), the giant criminal thug, one of Corleone's most trusted enforcers; Tessio (Abbe Vigoda), the fearsome tall enforcer who implies the possibility of violent revenge guaranteeing Michael's safety; and Clemenza (Richard Castellano), the other faithful enforcer...With a beautiful score by Nino Rota immensely memorable, Coppola's motion picture remains a triumph, nearly perfect in its execution, composition, and impact..."
The Godfather,09-Mar-19,This film is pretty much the perfection of the craft. Every single aspect of The Godfather is outstanding. There are so many iconic lines and moments throughout the movie that have been replicated and entrenched in culture over the years. There really isn't too much else to say. This is truly the peak of filmmaking.
The Godfather,27-Dec-15,"What a brilliant film. It is one of my favorites. The aging patriarch of an organized crime dynasty transfers control of his clandestine empire to his reluctant son. I love this film All of my family loves it My girlfriend loves it. I think it is one of the best films ever. It stars many actors such as Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. It is one of the most greatest films of all time. I have it on DVD at home and the Soundtrack at home.The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Albert S. Ruddy from a screenplay by Mario Puzo and Coppola. Starring Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as the leaders of the fictional Corleone New York crime family, the story spans the years 1945–55, concentrating on the transformation of Michael Corleone from reluctant family outsider to ruthless Mafia boss while chronicling the family under the patriarch Vito.Based on Puzo's best-selling novel of the same name, The Godfather is widely regarded as one of the greatest films in world cinema and as one of the most influential, especially in the gangster genre. Ranked second to Citizen Kane by the American Film Institute in 2007,it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry of the Library of Congress in 1990 as being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"".The film was the box office leader for 1972 and was, for a time, the highest-grossing picture ever made. It won three Academy Awards for that year: Best Picture, Best Actor (Brando) and in the category Best Adapted Screenplay for Puzo and Coppola. Its nominations in seven other categories included Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall for Best Supporting Actor and Coppola for Best Director. The success spawned two sequels: The Godfather Part II in 1974, and The Godfather Part III in 1990."
The Godfather,16-May-04,"Before 'The Godfather' came out in 1972, the gangster genre, chiefly associated with Jimmy Cagney and the film noir style of the forties and fifties, had been in something of a decline. It was, therefore, a brave move for Francis Ford Coppola to attempt a three-hour epic based upon the family life of a Mafia don. The film opens in the immediate post-war period with the wedding of the daughter of Don Vito Corleone. Scenes of the wedding are intercut with scenes showing Don Vito himself in his study, granting favours and dispensing a crude form of justice as though he were an absolute monarch. We soon learn, however, that times are changing, even in the world of organised crime. Don Vito's empire has been based upon gambling, illicit liquor sales and prostitution. Other Mafia families, however, are eager for the profits to be made from drugs, and Corleone receives a proposal from a drug dealer named Sollozzo that the Corleone clan should join him in exploiting the narcotics market. Corleone refuses, ostensibly for business reasons, but it is made clear that his real objections to narcotics derive from his personal code of honour. Sollozzo, offended, orders an attempt to be made on Corleone's life. This fails, but Corleone is left seriously injured.The focus now shifts to the younger generation. Don Vito has three sons, Santino ('Sonny'), Fredo and Michael, and an adopted son, Tom Hagen. These four have contrasting characters. Sonny is hot-headed and impetuous, Fredo weak, Tom cautious and moderate. Michael, the youngest, loves his family, but initially wants to play no part in their criminal enterprises. Recently returned from the war, his ambitions are to qualify as a lawyer and to settle down in a respectable life with his Anglo-Saxon wife-to-be, Kay. The attempt on his father's life, however, persuades Michael that his first loyalty is to the family, and he agrees to be part of a revenge attack on Sollozzo and Captain McCluskey the corrupt policeman who is on his payroll. There follows a brutal cycle of revenge, as each killing is avenged by another murder. The film's emphasis on family ties, honour and vengeance recall the revengers' tragedies of the Shakespearean and Jacobean theatre. Coppola does seem to be aiming for a Shakespearean grandeur. Don Vito, the ageing monarch whose powers slip away is reminiscent of King Lear, Michael, a good man corrupted by power, of Macbeth (a comparison which will become even more apt in the later episodes of the trilogy). There is also something of Hamlet in Michael and Sonny's resolve to avenge their father. Such an ambitious film requires acting of a very high order if it is to seem credible, but Coppola was able to draw upon some of the best performances of the seventies. To my mind, this was Marlon Brando's last great role (I have never cared much for 'Apocalypse Now' and loathed 'Last Tango in Paris'), but it was one that he made the most of. His Don Vito is both terrifying and pitiable, part dictator and part lonely old man. His rasping voice (the result of an earlier bullet wound in the throat) conveys both menace and physical weakness. Don Vito may be a bad man, but he is also in a way a magnificent one, and his passing marks the end of an era. If the film was notable for the last of the great Brando, it also saw the birth of a new star. Except perhaps for 'The Godfather Part II', I have never seen Al Pacino give a better performance than he did here, as he portrayed Michael's passage from a 'civilian' (as his brother calls him) to a warlord, from an innocent young idealist to a ruthless killer. Given the length of time that Pacino is on screen, I am surprised that he was only nominated for Best Supporting Actor rather than Best Actor. It would be interesting to speculate who might have won if he and Brando had been in competition for the award. I am even more surprised that Pacino did not win as Best Supporting Actor; Joel Grey's role in 'Cabaret' (which did win) is more showy and a technical tour de force, but it lacks the emotional depth of Pacino's performance. I also greatly admired James Caan's role as the hot-headed Sonny. This is not a perfect film; it has flaws, both artistic and ethical. Artistically, there are places where it tends to drag, particularly after the killings of Sollozzo and McCluskey, and even more so after the killing of Sonny, although it recovers at the ending, which is a highly effective piece of cinema. Ethically, I felt that the film tended to take the characters' world view too much at face value. Don Vito may be a dictator, but he is in his own eyes a benevolent dictator, a man of honour who lives by his own moral code. As others such as Roger Ebert have pointed out, this is a film which views a closed society from the inside; the only outsider is Kay, and her role is a relatively minor one. As a result, we do not get to see the damage that organised crime does to the fabric of society, and the Mafia's own view of itself is never openly challenged. That is not to say, however, that the film is totally amoral. We do see that an ethos of taking revenge can spiral out of control and lead to unforeseen consequences, to the innocent as well as the guilty. This is particularly true of the scenes where Michael takes refuge in Sicily after killing Sollozzo. The dead man's associates track him down, and a bomb meant for him instead kills his innocent young Italian wife Apollonia. Although there may be no overt condemnation of the moral position of the Mafia, there is implied criticism of its bloodier deeds. All the characters, whatever the crimes of which they may be guilty, are careful to pay lip-service to the Catholic Church and its rituals. Throughout the film (indeed, throughout the trilogy as a whole) the traditional ceremonies of the Church form a backdrop to various criminal activities. ('The Godfather' begins with a wedding and ends with a baptism). It seemed to me that Coppola was using these scenes to make an ironic contrast between the values of organised crime and those of Christianity, especially at the end of the film. Michael, already a 'godfather' in the metaphorical sense of a Mafia boss, becomes one in the literal sense of a baptismal sponsor. Shots of him taking vows on behalf of his godchild to reject the works of the devil are intercut with shots of his enemies being gunned down on his orders.Despite my reservations about this film, and although I personally would not have ranked it as my all-time favourite, there can be no denying that it is a film of great power and a milestone in the history of the cinema. 8/10"
The Godfather,11-Aug-98,"The Godfather is one of the very few films that doesn't have a single flaw.  Seeing The Godfather for the first time was the most amazing movie experiences of my life.  There's scenes that stay with you when the movies over, and you don't forget them.   Everyone makes the mistake of calling this film a movie about crime.  Its really a movie about family.  The dialogue is just unbelievable.  I've seen the movie at least 30, 40 times, and I'm still amazed at how perfect it is.  The music, the acting, everything.  People think that Citizen Kane is the greatest movie ever made...well, there's no way  that ANYONE can think that Citizen Kane is more moving, and has a better storyline than The Godfather.  The thing I find so amazing about The Godfather is how Michael (Al Pacino) changes throughout the movie.   Its my opinion that this is the greatest movie ever made, and I doubt that anyone can watch this movie, and think I'm crazy."
The Godfather,10-Jun-99,"Engrossing motion picture that features some of the finest editing, cinematography and performances ever. There is a wonderful theme of family that runs through this film and its later sequels. No one is truly judged. Love is unconditional. God is the one who truly judges. Easily, the word masterpiece describes this film, but that's been said by so many...Who am I to argue? Masterpiece is right on the money."
The Invisible Man,28-Feb-20,"I really enjoyed the first 2/3 of this film. They are filled with palpable tension and a general unease at not being able to see the ""monster."" This is another example of how what you cannot see is often scarier than what you can see. The direction is great and perfectly places the viewer in Elizabeth Moss' shoes, which is what generates most of the tension as you the viewer are also unsure where this invisible person is at all times. The spin of domestic violence also lends a new, modern twist on the classic premise.Where the film falters is in its third act with some significant plot holes regarding cameras and visibility of certain actions. There were also several times where the film felt like it was at its conclusion, but kept going. The ending will likely be divisive, however I didn't hate it. The Invisible Man is technically a very well-made thriller, but loses a few marks due to some issues with the plot."
The Invisible Man,14-Mar-20,"H.G. Wells's original The Invisible Man (1897) suggests that rather than something as powerful as invisibility being used for the betterment of mankind, it would instead be used to fulfil private desires, ultimately leading to the moral corruption of otherwise good men. In probably the best cinematic adaptation, Hollow Man (2000), this is taken much further, with the suggestion that the results of invisibility would be nothing less than sexual violence, evil, and madness. However, despite the centrality of this theme in the core story, reframing the template as a tale of domestic abuse and PTSD, as happens in this latest adaptation, which focuses not on the male scientist but on a female victim of his, is a fascinating idea, creating the potential for some timely #MeToo social commentary, particularly as it relates to issues of not believing women who accuse powerful men of gaslighting. But potential only gets you so far, and what could have been a really insightful film eventually proves itself relatively incapable of using issues of domestic abuse as anything other than plot points to get from one predictable scare to the next.The film begins as Cecilia Kass (Elisabeth Moss) is putting into motion a plan to leave her domineering and abusive boyfriend, Adrian Griffin (Oliver Jackson-Cohen), a wealthy pioneer in optics. Having drugged him, she leaves their high-tech home in the middle of the night and is picked up nearby by her sister Emily (Harriet Dyer), who takes her to stay with their childhood friend, James Lanier (Aldis Hodge), a policeman living with his daughter Sydney (Storm Reid). Although assured that Adrian can't find her, Cecilia is clearly suffering from agoraphobia and paranoia. That is until Adrian commits suicide. Contacted by his brother Tom (Michael Dorman) who's handling his estate, Cecilia learns that Adrian has left her $5 million. However, despite her best efforts to move on, she just can't shake the feeling that Adrian is still around, watching her, sometimes even in the same room as her. And the surer she becomes that he's not dead, the more everyone else becomes worried about her mental well-being.Written and directed by Leigh Whannell, this latest adaptation of Wells's original is not actually about the invisible man. Indeed, short of a background shot of him lying in bed, a shot showing only his torso as he runs through a forest, and a close-up of his hand, actor Oliver Jackson-Cohen doesn't even appear on screen prior to his apparent suicide. Adrian is not only the invisible man of the plot, so too is his character ideologically invisible. Which makes its own statement, and it's a statement worth making - men like him don't need to be present to continue to cause harm. In this sense, at least initially, the film is more concerned with the fear Adrian has instilled in Cecilia; in the early stages, Cecilia's main enemy isn't Adrian so much her inability to move on from him. Along the same lines, the film looks at issues of how women who accuse powerful men of gaslighting are often ignored or openly disbelieved.Aesthetically, the film looks terrific, particularly Stefan Duscio's cinematography, into which is built Cecilia's paranoia. For example, countless scenes involve the camera panning away from her, moving across the room, showing us nothing at all, and then panning back. Ordinarily, this would be textbook unmotivated camera movement, but here it conveys how Cecelia fears there may be something in the corner to which we panned. And now, thanks to that camera pan, so do we. There are also many shots which in another film would be awful framing; isolating Cecilia in the frame and filling up so much of the screen's real-estate with empty negative space. Except, again, in this film, such negative space has an ominousness not applicable to regular thrillers. In this way, Whannell can instil fear and dread simply by pointing the camera at an empty room without the need for any FX, VFX, makeup, elaborate props etc (which no doubt played a significant role in keeping the budget down to a minuscule $7 million). And I'd be remiss if I didn't mention Moss's performance, which is excellent, especially given that so much of it is her on her own reacting to nothing whatsoever, having to communicate confusion, fear, anger etc through little more than her expression.Before talking about why I didn't like the film, however, I want to reiterate that I honestly can't say how much I admire the idea to reconstitute the genre template as a story about domestic violence. And it's an especially timely reconstitution, coming as it does in the era of #MeToo, when so many powerful men, once considered invisible in everything but name, able to perpetrate their crimes with impunity, have been revealed as the monsters they are. So I have no problem with the ideological paradigm shift. My problem is with the execution.For one thing, we know from the get-go that Cecilia isn't imagining things, that Adrian faked his suicide and is now stalking her whilst invisible. This isn't a twist, and the film makes no attempt to hide it. Granted, this is kind of unavoidable given how well-known the property is, but had the film allowed for even a little bit of ambiguity, it could have done wonders for emotional complexity, turning a story about invisibility into a story possibly about mental collapse. This would have effectively placed the audience in the same position as the other characters, doubting Cecilia's state of mind, which would, in turn, have enhanced the potency of the socio-political allegory. Another thing that bothered me is that in a film so focused on surveillance and privacy, there are several scenes where if there is even one functioning CCTV camera, the movie ends. A pivotal scene in a restaurant is an especially egregious example of this - one grainy image from a camera, and Cecilia can prove she's not going nuts and the whole plot unravels.However, my biggest problem is that what starts as a fascinating study of the lasting ramifications of domestic violence ultimately descends into genre stupidity, with a ridiculously over-the-top final act that says nothing of interest about anything. True, Hollow Man has a pretty over-the-top final act too, but Hollow Man never saw itself as anything other than a schlocky genre affair, whereas The Invisible Man clearly does. The fact that Whannell ultimately undermines himself in this way, deploying such important themes merely to get him to the gory dénouement, is especially frustrating insofar as he genuinely did originally seem to have some interesting things to say. Tied to this is that Adrian is introduced as such an abhorrent character from the start, void of nuance or subtlety. Domestic abusers aren't monotone evil-doers, oftentimes, they're very charming on the surface, and any film claiming to be a serious examination of this topic would make room to address this.Although The Invisible Man was very well reviewed and a huge box-office hit, it left me disappointed and frustrated. Initially positioning itself as an insightful allegory for the difficulty victims of domestic abuse have in moving on with their lives even after the abuser is gone, it eventually privileges genre beats and cheap thrills over emotional complexity. Which is a huge shame and a massively missed opportunity."
The Invisible Man,02-Mar-20,"When you first watch the movie you're thinking okay this is pretty good. Interesting. Starts slow but it builds up and the ending is nice. She gets away with killing the abusive ex boyfriend and lives happily ever after.But after thinking about things for a minute you realize... other than her saying it you don't see any real indication that he did much to her. You are pretty much taking her word for everything. And then when it comes to the boyfriend... what is it about him? You see yeah he can be manipulative but you barely see that. But then you see the main thing the movie is about... the invisible suit and what are they really made for? Who were they made for and how many of those suits did he really have?Then on top of that when you're learning about the boyfriend you learn that he is supposed to be on top of everything. Very observant . And knows what is going on in his place. And especially when it comes to those suits he would know how many he has and what's going on with them. YET when she hides one of those suits that doesn't register in his mind. Like she took the suit off of the dummy, didn't replace it on the dummy in the place... and in fact was attacked moments later. So it should've been known that the suit was missing AND that it would be in the closet or somewhere leading towards the closet since that where she went and yet... nothing.Then there is the scene where her sister gets her throat cut in the middle of a fancy restaurant. And the thing about any eating establishment... there are cameras everywhere. The fancier it is the more cameras there would be. So how is it that they were so sure she killed her sister and didn't spend a single second looking at any of the video footage? Because if they would have spent any time they would have seen a floating knife to notice... something isn't right. But nope somehow all of that was ignored and she was just immediately guilty.And there was the when the daughter got hit while the main girl was down on the ground. Like she's starting to get back up to her feet and is a little distance away. The daughter gets hit and doesn't register that there is no way she could have hit me. Something had to have hit me. Nope. Like if you're on your hands and knees there is no way you're generating enough force to knock someone to the ground and that didn't register with the girl.But yeah its like if you watch the movie and remove your mind from it then its pretty good. But if you start thinking about it you notice things that should've been thought through differently and at least fleshed out a lot more. So that's why the rating went from a near 8 down to a 4. Its just not as good as initially and originally thought."
The Invisible Man,02-Mar-20,I'm sorry but at times I just don't understand the reviews on this site. There were soooooooo many plot holes it just ruined what other wise could have been a half decent film. I'm afraid that a good film can easily be ruined when the narrative simply doesn't follow and this is one of those cases.
The Invisible Man,27-Apr-20,"I'm surprised at the number of highly negative reviews on here. Most of them pertain to plot issues. I'm all for exposing plot holes, but most of these could be easily explained with a little creativity. Just some examples: People complain that the antagonist has super-human strength. This is not the case at all. He has the advantage of the element of surprise. A moderately strong (invisible) male could lift a female in the air, and could toss her across a table; and could beat the crap out of bigger dudes. People complain about the third suit: But there could have been ten suits, and he could have lost track of a suit. People complain about the dog being at the house; but for all we know she lost track of the dog on the night of her escape and the dog returned to the house later. People complain that she would not risk her plan by taking the dog with her; but it would be simple enough to take the dog with her and meet her sister in the road, while her husband sleeps. People complain about how he gets around: but his brother could drive him; or he could jump on a bus and hide; or he could just take off the suit and drive around like a normal person; or he could put on a wig and makeup. People complain about the guards not defending themselves better; but they have never encountered an invisible man before and would not know what is going on. People complain at her reaction in the restaurant; but she would be in shock and there's no telling how a person would react to that. Some people complain about how quickly the Uber driver arrives; but the scene does show her looking at her phone (and the Uber app), and we don't know how much time has elapsed before this time. (It's possible that she was running and hiding in the neighborhood for 5 minutes.) Maybe the husband developed the suit at a research facility and made a few extra suits for himself and took them home. I'm not saying there are no plot holes, but the complaints here are far too harsh, and lack imagination. The movie is novel, suspenseful, and interesting, and well-acted. (This is not exactly a plot-hole, but wouldn't a DNA test on the fetus prove that it was his son, and thereby implicate him in the crimes? The brothers weren't twins.)"
The Invisible Man,21-Mar-20,"7.5 rating on here I thought this would turn out to be a pretty decent movie. What I got instead was a boring mess. Zero character development, no emotional connection to the main characters to make you care what happens to them. Do yourself a favor and find something else."
The Invisible Man,06-Mar-20,"Mediocre thriller filled with illogical plot holes. The first third of the movie is marginally alright. After it transitions into a sci fi comedy, with the main protagonist playing John Wick, while the main antagonist plays an inverse Bruce Wayne. In this fictional universe, security guards are apparently trained at a bakery. Cameras make no sound whatsoever. Are amazingly waterproof and stain-phobic. Not even paint can stain those. Little girls have a 6th sense for rape and murder. The penetration of a can of pepper spray is equal to that of a cannon ball. Physical objects are ephemeral in nature when it comes to rain drops hitting them. I mean, god damn, i need to get me a set od those god like cameras. And Nat Geo should too, probably.This movie is not even good for making fun of, if you wish to watch a dumb movie with your friends and have a good time - go watch As Above So Below."
The Invisible Man,29-Feb-20,"The guy puts on a suit, becomes invisible to irritate his wife. So there's no ghost but a man in suit. Then how did he commute? He's covering long distances to follow her everywhere. How is that possible for an invisible guy? Is he driving - but there was no sign of his car? If brother is driving him around - Where is his car too? Is nobody noticing a car with no driver?
It would be so easy for a crazy guy like him being invisible to tie her down one night, throw in his car & take her away instead of playing with her quilts.
In one scene, she got hold of another suit which she could wear & become invisible herself. Won't that make more sense?
But she locked it in house & ran back only to come back later for then end stunt.
One more point - roads have CCTV but not a hospital. Howcome receptionists don't see anything or call 911.
Very unthoughtful movie."
The Invisible Man,01-Mar-20,I can't begin to convey how bad this thing is. Elisabeth Moss spends the entire movie looking like she has to use the bathroom. The scenes are too long and the music is way too loud and overwhelming. Bottom lime is Hollywood makes another reboot that stinks up the joint. Total waste of time. Can't hold a candle to the original. Make this movie invisible!
The Invisible Man,24-Jun-20,"""He said that wherever I went, he would find me, walk right up to me, and I wouldn't be able to see him.""I probably yawned and rolled my eyes when I first heard they were rebooting The Invisible Man. This idea had been done and done and done...right? Wrong! Director Leigh Whannell breathes new life into the concept. Now it's a vehicle for Elisabeth Moss, as Cecilia, who is in every scene and steals them all.Sound and vision are used to keep you on edge. Is Cecilia suffering a mental breakdown because of her abuse...or is there an invisible man following her? Moss and Whannell squeeze every ounce out of this scenario and it all works. This movie even sidesteps the science missteps of earlier versions with an updated version of the character. Though very different from the book by H.G. Wells, I feel like he would approve."
The Invisible Man,26-Feb-20,"What would you do if your abusive ex figured out a way to stalk you without fear of being discovered? That's the conceit at the centre of Leigh Whannell's latest film, The Invisible Man, a nail-biting thriller that has more on its mind than providing simple thrills.Starring Elisabeth Moss as Cecilia Kass, a woman who is rendered helpless in the face of an invisible evil, Whannell spins H.G. Wells classic science fiction novel of the same name into a timely and provocative exploration of psychological abuse.Having escaped from a controlling relationship, Cecilia's rehabilitation is cut short by the sudden intrusion of her ex who has figured out how to regain control over her life without anyone knowing: by becoming invisible.Expertly utilising sci-fi trappings to take gaslighting to a whole new extreme, the film depicts first-hand the anxieties faced by many modern-day survivors of abuse. As Cecilia stresses to those around her that her genius scientist ex has become invisible, we are left conflicted by knowing the truth of her words but also the understanding that, without hard evidence, it's hard to accept her story at face value.By operating in that grey area, The Invisible Man proves the horror genre to be one of the most effective means to reflect modern day anxieties to mass audiences.The trade-off, however, is that by focusing solely on Cecilia's plight, the films feels somewhat underexplained in terms of its villain. Certain actions of his seem straight up superhuman and, without an explanation, it feels as if some logical concessions have been made for dramatic purposes. Granted, to Whannell's credit, he wisely abides by the notion that leaving certain things up to the imagination is better than over explaining to the point of exhaustion.Where so many would-be franchises have failed by focusing too much on setting up sequels, The Invisible Man plays squarely to its strength as a strong, character driven film. Whether it connects to an extended universe remains to be seen, but the film, much like its protagonist, feels much stronger standing on its own."
The Invisible Man,28-Feb-20,"The Invisible Man ... hmmmm. Well, it wasn't awful, but it wasn't great. I still don't understand what house she went to, her relationship with the two people that live there, and why it never occurs to her to use the camera on her phone to record video for evidence.In today's world, films really need to go out of their way to explain a LACK of smartphone use. They are so prevalent that NOT using them is a plot hole, and not a small one. It really kind of irritates me.There is one legit good jump scare and some good tense moments. But for the most part it just feels like a real wasted opportunity.I hate to say it, but Hollow Man did it better."
The Invisible Man,29-Feb-20,"I gritted my teeth the whole way through this. Being unfamiliar with the lead actress I had no frame of reference. However after nearly 2 hours of her 10 foot high head gurning at me I was traumatised. I genuinely don't understand the reviews for her acting. Like I say I have no idea who she is but good God.
Apart from her character's unbelievable stupidity and awkwardness, I couldn't understand the relationship between her and her controlling husband. We were just told everything. There was no discovery. From her well-planned escape that basically consisted of her being completely unprepared, changing her clothes in the house, completely forgetting she had an enormous dog, the awkwardness of her bumping into things no one at the rendezvous, I was driven mental within the first 10 minutes.
There was no descent into madness. The audience could have been given one iota of respect and offered the possibility that there was in fact no invisible man. Instead there was screaming and shouting and blubbering. Right up to the very end I got no sense of being drawn into any real story.
For me the massive carbuncle in the plot was the finding of the second suit and her hiding it in the place that he actually found her. Surely he must have noticed that it was missing? I mean it was a massive suit and the only place that she could have hidden it was where she was eh, hiding. Let's forget about the fight in the corridor where she was literally lying beside a gun screaming and neglected to pick it up.In conclusion I avoided trailers for this. I was assured by several outstanding reviews that this was fabulous and terrifying. It was neither. The reviewers were unfamiliar with true horror films probably because judging by some of the language I read, none of them had ever been to one.
A final note. Giant close-ups of actors' faces deliberately lit to show bad skin may be ""woke"" but it put me off my massive insipid hotdog."
The Invisible Man,29-Feb-20,"It honestly makes me sad that we live in an era where a poorly written screenplay like this gets such high praise. I don't even know where to begin to express how bad this film was. I wanted to walk out with 30 minutes left and I never do that. Just when you think the pain is going to end and the movie is over, there is an additional 4th act to add to the absurdity!The lead does a decent job acting in this film but hard to not get a bunch of filth on you in the process.Honestly, do we live in an era where people have stopped thinking and just want to go to a film and zone out and not require it to be good anymore or have a good story?Stay away from this trash."
The Invisible Man,28-Feb-20,"An interesting modern take on the invisible man concept in this twisted mind game nightmare yet it comes with the lack of the invisible man presence! An abused wife escapes her narcissist and sadistic husband to her friend's house only to know after a couple of weeks that he committed suicide, in what seems like a happy ending for her turns out to be hell as she feels her husband's presence around here almost everywhere which leads her to suspect that he's still alive and won't let her go this easy.So far the idea sounds interesting but for a general thriller, not revival of a classic, I believe the plot should've been approached with more of a homage to the classic adaption. I know the idea of taking chemical potions to become invisible is over used but a plot mix between modern technology and past methods would've been a better choice, I already have couple of ideas on how to do so just by writing this.Elisabeth Moss carries the movie well, yet the movie feels more like ""The Invisible Man's Wife"" story more than being The Invisible Man story! Practically almost the whole movie is focused on the wife, her mental suffering and what she's going through, you can barley see/sense any character development or acting from the invisible man at all. Some scenes are very predictable like you can almost see through but it's a nice piece of a (general thriller) for the most part."
The Invisible Man,26-Feb-20,"First of all, let me start with how excited I was to see this movie. Luckily, I got to catch this in an advanced preview. And I will say this, the excitement, counting of days, posting on social media, all paid off.This movie definitely scares you. It's not just jumpscares or loud noises, it's something psychological. From the first opening shot, you're immediately put inside Elisabeth Moss' character Cecilia's head. She is stuck in an abusive relationship and can't get out of it. The whole opening scene makes you uncomfortable as we see Cecilia trying to make her escape. This kind of tension is kept on throughout the film.Another thing this film succeeds upon is the writing. The story progresses in a fast paced way which doesn't seem hurried. The 2hr runtime feels achieved. There's definitely more than one 'WTF' moment in this film to keep you on the edge of your seat.The score and the sound design definitely puts you in Cecilia's shoes as you struggle with her to point out where exactly the invisible man might be. The camera work is exquisite, I mean did we really doubt the director who brought us Upgrade? The action sequences definitely feel thrilling and the way it's shot makes you feel like you're living it.In my book, Elisabeth Moss can do no wrong. Her acting here is definitely something to be noted. From her being hysterically scared to her fighting back, Moss sells it. She makes us root for her. Oliver Jackson Cohen, who plays her abusive husband has a small but really pivotal role and boy o boy he is scary. The rest of supporting cast is also really good. Overall, this is Moss' movie and she carries it with ease.This year (so far) there hasn't been many horror movies that genuinely gave me anxiety or made me jump. So I am happy this film succeeded in doing both. Leigh Whanell is an amazing horror writer/director and proves that he can still give us a solid entertaining flick.There's some solid moments of blood so gorehounds can rejoice.I thought about it a lot and I can't really think of anything that didn't work. Some of you might complain about the camera work and how it focuses on the actor's faces more than the action but to me that worked. I think that definitely sold the drama.All and all this was a terrific film, really made the universal monster scary by mixing the monster with a relevant story. I will give this film a 9/10.If you liked this review please like my page Let's Talk Horror."
The Invisible Man,01-Mar-20,"Read the reviews here before heading to the movie. Walked out after 30 minutes. I mean seriously, Moss in the lead role? No explanation who are the characters Moss went to live with. She is as expressive as Mona Lisa. How can this movie be so highly rated here? I feel cheated with my hard earned money."
The Invisible Man,22-Mar-20,"Slow start, slow middle, slow ending. Even the attempt at throwing in a twist couldn't help this movie. I haven't been that bored watching a movie in super long time."
The Invisible Man,17-Mar-20,"I just got back from a nearly empty theater in order to see this, and I wish I hadn't paid. I don't even wish I'd illegally downloaded it, I wish it were never made so I was never tempted to see it. Hollow Man was better, and that's a sad statement. Who in the hell is rating this positively? There was no 'there' there. No backstory on ANY of the characters, not a single memorable line delivered, and not even an explanation for the so called science fiction aspect of this. On top of that a highly unbelievable story about domestic violence in which we are to believe that a handsome, rich genius is somehow in love with and obsessed with Elizabeth Moss of all people. Leave her to the Handmaid's Tale, she is not meant to be a romantic interest. She got lucky on this because of her origins. Her acting was the usual. I get it, this is supposed to be a horror, but it wasn't even that. Just typical 'made ya flinch!' moments that weren't even that because it was so gosh darn predictable. The positive ratings must be from people who were just glad for the diversity and glad to see yet another white guy cast as a villian (which gets no explanation at all, not even a flashback to what he did that was so horrible. To the point where at the end you can't even be sure he was a villian at all). I was sure a woman wrote this at the end, but I was disappointed to see it was the guy who did Saw. That was at least entertaining. This was embarrassing.Shame on all of you who voted this up. We shall get more of the same as Idiocracy becomes more of a documentary than a ridiculous fiction movie."
The Invisible Man,08-Mar-20,"This is one of the worst movies I've seen in years. I dont understand the good reviews, I saw the trailer and got excited, I read the reviews and I got even more excited.. I saw the movie and Jesus, not scary at all and the story was just bad.. This is a sci-fi, not a horror movie.."
The Invisible Man,29-Feb-20,"This movie which they are calling a modern day reboot of the 1933 classic took a scary and tragic character and made him a one-dimensional jump scare. In the 2020 film the Invisible Man uses his invisibility to stalk and terrorize his ex which is scary for her and anybody who wants to help her but does not really fill me with any sense of dread. Now the 1933 Invisible Man he killed at random and most of the time he killed people he didn't even know. A police chief, a couple of people out trying to find him he pushed them off a cliff and he even caused a train to derail killing who knows how many innocent people.Next we come to character himself in the 2020 film he is just a one dimensional abusive boyfriend pretty who is given no character development. Now in the 1933 film the Invisible Man he was once a good kind gentle man who truly loved his girlfriend but the drugs he took to make himself invisible gradually drive him insane and transform him into a homicidal killer. And thus there is the tragedy of the 1933 character a once good man turned evil.And finally we come to last disappointment the means by which they achieve invisibility in the 2020 movie it is a suit which means anyone can put it on and become invisible or make copies of it and create a whole armies of invisible people.Also since it is a suit he can just take it off whenever he wants and be visible again. In the 1933 film it is a chemical formula that only he knows meaning he can be the only invisible one in the story and he as no way of becoming visible again in the movie he was trying to to cure his invisibility but eventually the madness from the drugs overtook him. And once again this makes him a tragic figure.So there you go you have a scary but still tragic character vs. a non-scary one-dimensional character which one would you want to watch?"
The Invisible Man,10-May-20,"A woman furtively leaves her marital bed at dead of night in a hill-top, bay-view, hi-tech luxury mansion. She gets away from her soon-pursuing husband by the skin of her teeth and we soon learn in the aftermath that said husband was a control-freak, obsessively watching her every move. And if you look carefully, also that he's seriously into optics and the like, remember that, it's important. Next thing, she's told by hubby's lawyer brother that he's been killed and she's been left his fortune. So she moves in with her cop pal and his college-age daughter and in relief, starts splashing the cash, but somehow she just can't shake the feeling that her old man is still around and actually isn't dead at all.From this set-up, the film could really have gone one of two or three ways, either as a realistically presented psychological thriller with her out-of-sight ex using his power and influence to disrupt her life while keeping well away from her, or even as a study in paranoia with the wife suffering some kind of breakdown and just imagining all the crazy things happening to her. Or, it could of course go the full H.G. Wells and set the psycho-spouse up as a mirror-suited (remember what I said about his interest in all things optical?) killing-machine, rendering him invisible, out to get her back under his control which plan he puts into motion by firstly framing her for the murder of her own sister just for starters, as you would. Guess which way it goes?So sure enough we get all the cliched, seen-'em-before silly-looking scenes of people fighting and getting beating up by an invisible enemy and lots of static, subjective camera-shots looking at inanimate objects and inviting the viewer to join the connecting dots.Elisabeth Moss as the persecuted wife, gets to bring out her scared, angry and mad faces as the body count increases and the situations become even more ridiculous and predictable. Not that she takes all the mayhem happening around her lying down, oh no, she sure enough overcomes her terror, finds her inner Sarah Connor and decides to fight back leading to a final reckoning back at their old house. For me, she does a good job of staying in character without once breaking out into fits of laughter at all that's going on, especially when her stalker turns out to resemble a now-you-see-him, now-you-don't super-villain running around in a costume that, when revealed, makes him look like a shiny Spider Man.I just found it all very predictable, weakly-characterised, mildly absurd film entertainment. For one thing, I thought the editing poor with jumps to scenes with little or no explanation. Once I sussed how the film was playing all the carefully arranged attempts at dramatic tension evaporated so that I couldn't even be bothered to shout ""He's behind, in front of, to the left or right of you or wherever he was!"" at the screen.Sorry, with its transparent characters and see-through narrative, I just couldn't see what all the fuss was about here."
The Invisible Man,29-Feb-20,"Very poor. slow and tedious.
how this film has received a score in the 7+ range is beyond me.
i'm starting to believe that some of the ratings on imdb are faked
and probably placed by a bot."
The Invisible Man,06-Jul-20,"The best thing about this movie starts and ends with it starring Elisabeth Moss. I was left with so many damn questions after watching it that I just couldn't ignore.
Why did his brother help him?
Who was her friend to her (the guy she stayed with)?
What did she do with the second suit?
Why were there 2 suits and why OH WHY did he leave them out?
Why did he kill all those people at the prison when he didnt wanna get found out?
How was she gonna get out of a murder charge just by going back to her husband?
When was it the invisible man his brother and not his brother?
How did nobody know he was in the attic?
How did he text his mobile phone ""SURPRISE"" when she had the phone?
I could go on and on but let's just say it started with a bang and ended with a head scratch."
The Invisible Man,02-Jul-20,With the pandemic I think studios released the movies they were not in love with and are still holding on to their best movies for later this year or the beginning of next year. There was an abundance to stream but The Invisible Man was one of the few movies I thought was actually good.Elisabeth Moss had an excellent performance. Really making me feel the horror of the situations she was in. The concept was nice. It was executed well with some terrifying scenes. Not just seeing the horror but making you imagine the horror. There were some by the book scenes but the creators also did create some memorable unique scenes. Worth the watch.
Harriet,03-Nov-19,"I attend a HBCU and have read, and studied, Harriet Tubman's life. I don't even know where to begin. There is no account of her ever standing with Union soldiers and pointing a gun. There are so many errors and what I saw on the screen was complete fiction. I wasn't expecting a documentary, of course, but the woman they portrayed lived a completely different life to everything I've been taught by professors who live and breathe African American history. Hollywood should be ashamed."
Harriet,06-Nov-19,"Look, nobody's questioning Harriet Tubman's contributions or her role in the history of the abolitionist movement. But, except for the names, this movie has about as much to do with actual history as Underdog does with rescuing war dogs. I have to wonder what would have happened to a black woman walking around in the slave holding south dressed like Hollywood's version of a pseudo Annie Oakley. The filmmakers had a golden opportunity here to get this right but chose to throw a bunch of candified, Hollywood cliches at it instead. That's not to say there weren't some emotional moments, but the real history and achievement of Harriet Tubman is emotional and soul stirring enough without burying it under 10 feet of Hollywood glitz in order to appeal to the superhero crowd. Boo. Hiss."
Harriet,02-Nov-19,"WHY? How difficult is it to get first hand and historical accounts and stick to THAT SCRIPT? What on earth is to be gained by taking a larger than life figure, a real person and throwing in random people and events that never happened?If you want to see a REAL MOVIE on Harriet Tubman, look at the Cicely Tyson version: A Woman Called Moses."
Harriet,28-Oct-19,"I wonder if the people giving this film a ""nine"" or ""ten star"" review or rating even saw this film? We are rating the film, not the person. If there is a botched and problem ridden film on da Vinci we don't rate the bad film highly because we like the person who is putative its subject.Please. The scripting is insultingly lowbrow, almost patronizing. The acting talent has a good record in other productions but in this film is unrealized due to the other problems. There are quite a few ahistoric, frankly false, events in this film which are not needed and make the film more a less than credible hagiography as opposed to the plenty sufficient bravery, courage and strength of Tubman herself. Why maker her some kind of mythical comic book type character???? Is this the story about a real life hero, or about a graphic novel superwoman who people will just assume is fictional?Lastly, I am not a religious believer. I am a confirmed atheist. But I find it troubling that Tubman's deep religious feelings and expression, whihc she used as the main, if not sole lens though which she saw the world, and which motivated her, is discounted.The film is not a total loss, but Tubman deserves better, much better, as do contemporary audiences."
Harriet,02-Nov-19,"This has to be the biggest disappointment of 2019. Whenever a movie is made about historical figures, there's always some degree of fiction. However, they went above and beyond this to a degree that was ridiculous. They needlessly created primary characters that aren't part of the historical record . Also, some elements of the relationship between Harriet Tubman and the slave master were totally unbelievable.The acting was ok but, never reached the caliber that one would expect for this type of film. Finally, the cinematography wasn't that great. It was done in a way that made it seem like a Lifetime movie or something that should have gone straight to dvd instead of being in theaters."
Harriet,01-Nov-19,It's a bit of an insult to African Americans being the story wasn't depicted clearly in the way it should've. Although Harriet is a hero it was played as a super hero movie . It took greatness and turned it into a joke. Cynthia's performance was corny as well as others
Harriet,04-Nov-19,For a movie that could have been steeped in actual history about an incredible woman they created a storyline that was complete rubbish ( fiction) and denied viewers insight into some of that most amazing things about this women. What a shame. I think people that loved this movie simply don't really know their history. The primary antagonist was a made up person to drive a fictional storyline.
Harriet,18-Sep-19,"Putting aside the directing, editing and overall story line the films most egregious aspect may actually be the score. Think cheesy lifetime TV movie style of music. It is so terrible in fact it is actually distracting. This might actually be the only silver lining considering the sluggish pace of the film that also unfortunately only tells one part of Harriet Tubman's incredible life. It is unfortunate that it has taken Hollywood this long to make a film about Tubman; however, perhaps they should have waited a little longer to get it right."
Harriet,11-Jul-20,An extraordinary film about an extraordinary woman who did some extraordinary things in extraordinary ways to make an extraordinary difference to the extraordinary people she helped and saved - absolutely extraordinary!
Harriet,03-Nov-19,So Harriet was an actual person but the story cooked up was false....So tired of them mixing little truth with a lot of lies.
Harriet,02-Nov-19,"Terribly inaccurate! This is a revisionist story which tries to make light of slavery and ONCE AGAIN makes the black man the bad guy. If you want truth, this is not for you! SHAMEFUL!"
Harriet,05-Nov-19,"I'm not understanding why so many people are hating on this movie. Show me a movie based on the life of a real person where the entire movie is 100% factual. I thought it did depict what I have read about Harriet Tubman in books, online, and what I actually read when I visited the Harriet Tubman museums/visitor center in Church Creek, MD, and Cambridge, MD. It was not poorly done. I loved it and highly recommend it!"
Harriet,01-Nov-19,"I went in wanting to love it, ended up just waiting for it to be over. The best part to me was the closing scene and the written adlibs after. I really don't like disparaging works that show the history of Blacks in America, as our stories need to be told, but I was very disappointed. The lead did not evoke any compassion in me, and the villain was very unconvincing. Think about it, 12 Years a Slave and Django had you side-eyeing the actors that played the slave owners because they emoted so well. The lead villain, Gideon Brodess, God Bless him, didn't pull it off IMO. The fact that the best performances were the supporting cast, Leslie Odom as William Still, Clarke Peter as Harriet's father, Omar J. Dorsey (no spoilers as to role) and Henry Hunter Hall (no spoilers as to role) doesn't bode well for a film. Maybe the fact that they made Harriet 24, 25 instead of a mature woman? Maybe it was the dialogue that was written a bit ""slick"" for the time period? Maybe the inconsistencies with what was presented vs reality? Even Janelle Monae was just so so for me. Although I do not work in Hollywood, when there are that many failures within performances and only the veteran actors shine, it may be the director. I dunno, but I was disappointed. I would still support the film because we need Hollywood to know we want our stories heard/seen. Maybe if Viola Davis' project had gotten support, her version would have been better. She was going to star in and produce a biopic on Harriet Tubman for HBO, but it never happened.
I would give it 5/10 stars."
Harriet,11-Feb-20,"HARRIET (2019)Abolitionist Harriet Tubman escaped from Maryland to Philadelphia in 1849 on foot by following the North Star and utilizing the help of the Underground Railroad, a network of secret routes and safe houses set up by white abolitionists and free people of color to help slaves to freedom. She then repeatedly risked her life by going back into the lion's den over a period of eleven years to lead other slaves to their freedom. She never lost a passenger. This is so damn brave it makes my head spin.This film served up a substantantial serving of history, embellished by a modicum of fiction. Though it's not a movie masterpiece, it's a strong depiction of Harriet's Heroes Journey that lifted me up for days. Cynthia Erivo's portrayal of a determined Harriet, known before her liberation as Araminta ""Minty"" Ross, (and later nicknamed Moses because she helped her people escape to freedom), was stirring; her singing was the gold on the edges. Harriet used spirituals as coded messages to warn fellows of danger or to signal a clear path.The antagonist in the story is the racist, corrupt system of slavery embodied in part by her heartless owners. Plagued by hypersomnia sleeping spells caused by a head injury when she was thirteen, Minty's owner Edward Bodess tried to sell her. This would separate her from her family. There were no buyers for her. Angry, Minty prayed, ""Oh Lord, if you ain't never going to change that man's heart, kill him, Lord, and take him out of the way."" Edward died. Harriet expressed regret for that prayer.Joe Alwyn played Gideon Brodess, Edward's grown son, with a conniving, lecherous sneer. Guideon leered after Minty and tormented her. Harriet's husband was a free black man in theory, but not reality; any future children of the couple would be slaves, regardless of papers granting manumet to Harriet's kin, which the Brodesses ignored. She and her husband planned to escape together, but Tubman fled alone and travelled a hundred miles through wilderness to Pennsylvania, being followed by her scummy owner Gildeon. Well, screw him, she made it, and became a heroine."
Harriet,09-Nov-19,"Who was this movie really made for? Possibly didn't want certain people/group to be offended by the subject matter. The actress and filmmakers claimed this is not a slave movie. If Harriet is not a slave movie, then what was slave Harriet running away from? Harriet Tubman's story is dramatic enough without adding fictional unreal characters.
If Harriet Tubman has to be told, then please tell her story the way it happened.
Harriet had a lifetime movie feel to it. The actress Cynthia Eviro didn't feel authentic to me in the role as Harriet Tubman.
Oh well I had a free movie ticket so...."
Harriet,01-Feb-20,"I have seen this film twice. The first time was at the Middleburg Film Festival, where the Director spoke afterwards. What is unique about this movie? Its honesty and its focus. I cannot relate to the bad reviews at all. It is NOT a cartoon. It does NOT depict Harriet as a superhero. She suffered greatly. But the film focuses on the empowerment of Harriet, largely through her own bravery, rather than making her a one dimensional victim. She is a hero because she took risks and made choices that other characters did not. She felt that God was working through her to show that the slavery system could be beaten. But the slaveholders cited God too, so you see both sides.The other characters' choices not to run are explained and we understand them. How can you run with two small children and your ""mistress"" calling for you every minute? The horrific abuses of the slavery system are woven into the story, as motivators for escape and abolition, but in contrast to any other slavery film, the focus is not on helpless slaves, and this makes it powerful. It is also the first film depicting slavery that made me see the economic desperation of not-that-rich white slaveholders as a driver for their cruelty. One can feel what it is like being born into this system, told from childhood that other people belong to you and being widowed or orphaned by an inept debtor, with your main assets as slaves. You felt how this brought out the worst aspects of human character, especially with your neighbors behaving the same way. This subplot is very important, because it helps us to understand why the US had this system for so long and what it took to overcome it."
Harriet,02-Nov-19,"If you are thinking of going to see this film, please, PLEASE do not believe the negative lies about this film. This film is PHENOMENAL. There's no Harriet romancing any white masters, there's no sex scenes with Harriet and everything the film says Harriet did, Harriet actually did in reality. The reason why people are being negative about this film is to keep the masses from seeing this film BECAUSE of its message. They don't want you to see and know the message of this film, the message of this film being that both black and white people can work together, for equality and for freedom.So i'm telling you, this film is WORTH the $24.50, you will not regret it. I KNOW it because I just came from seeing this film an hour ago tonight. GO SEE this film, it is POWERFUL."
Harriet,02-Nov-19,"Trashhhhhh! Script was trash and so was the casting. I'm willing to bet that no one who is Ados wanted to touch this mess with a 10 ft pole. This film somehow managed to attack the character of blk men who should be victims of their circumstances created by Europeans, while glorifying or making massa a person with a conscious when we all know that the brute animals of that time had no conscious. I'm glad I didn't pay a dime to support this mess. Nope, never."
Harriet,01-Feb-20,"The film is ultimately fairly frustrating. The central performance by Erivo was really good and powerful. The film is quite handsome-it was nice seeing some photography by Toll with a budget. The technical aspects provoke period and the director gets a lot of suspense out of Tubman's escape and rescue missions. The film takes a pretty narrow range of Tubman's life as its plot but working within that range it seems to be fairly accurate. It certainly was engaging. The film resists centering whiteness-abet not fully-and I was glad to see that the Underground Railroad seemed to be almost exclusively black. The film doesn't contain a white savoir trope so there's at least that.However, the film's narrowness results in a too simple and too short of a rendering of Tubman's life. Her work on Women's suffrage was a mere footnote. Arguments around what sort of actions the abolitionist movement should take were greatly reduced. John Brown was omitted entirely. Fredrick Douglas was given a cameo. The film jumps years at a time and it results in narrative that is merely a skeleton of Tubman's most well known experiences.The film is weirdly hesitant around Tubman committing justified violence. At times the film contorts itself to avoid showing Tubman hurting people, especially white people. It seemed to be too saintly of a characterization especially as the film leans heavily on Tubman's faith. (In general the faith stuff lands with emotional resonance). This is a far less visceral portrayal of slavery than 12 Years a Slave.Overall I think this is pretty good biopic."
Harriet,28-Nov-19,"I hated this movie. There isn't an ounce of authenticity in and it was just so bland. It was a movie about a black person made for a white audience to feel warm and fuzzy with a superhero angle thrown in. At least it didn't have the white slave owner turn out to be a nice guy (and they sure came close).The score is distractingly bad. It's an overbearing and manipulative score, ripped straight from any Lifetime movie. Then there is the opening scene showing a group of slaves gathered in front of their white slavemaster and establishes the fact that the bad guy is bad. It felt so amateurish to me and the rest of the movie then proceeded to feel similarly amateurish, cliched and predictable. On her first trip south, Harriet has what is supposed to be an emotional reunion with her family, but it's a bunch of characters we've never met so the scene just doesn't work. There are just so many things like that.It's such a shame because Harriet Tubman was such a heroic and interesting figure and her story is an important part of American history. I feel like this movie is getting a pass from the critics because of the material. I know I feel somewhat guilty writing a bad review merely because of the subject matter. Maybe what is needed is a Ken Burns style documentary so that the temptation to have cartoonishly cardboard baddies, scenes of singing Harriet, and heavily dramatized and fictional scenes for the sake of checking all of the 'Biopic Cliche' boxes can be resisted."
Harriet,03-Nov-19,"I do not believe the movie was marketed as a documentary. It shows another version of the life and times of Harriet Tubman. I sat on the edge of my seat wondering what would happen next. It shows how American politicians were comfortable with white supremacy concepts. I welcome movies that do not fall into concepts of the slanted history we were taught in school.The movie showed a hard life for Harriet, the slaves and freedmen at the time, but I believe they actually had it worse than what was depicted in the film."
Harriet,23-Nov-19,"Harriet Tubman was an extremely courageous and strong woman, who, during a toxic era In American history, risked her own life in order to help free other slaves.
That's the true Harriet Tubman.
The Harriet Tubman in this movie is more akin to Wonder Woman. It was a dreadful depiction of a woman who deserves to be remembered for what she actually did, not for this dreadful bucket of dog sick!
Holly""woke"" are really getting on my nerves now. Instead of padding out a decent and captivating story with some artistic license; in order to create an interesting movie, they're making things up as they go along, and adding a sprinkling of the truth ever now and again. It's like every movie has to contain an element of Marvel heroism.
If you're interested in the actual history of this incredible woman, read Harriet Tubman: The Road to Freedom.
If you want a load of old gash - watch the movie."
Harriet,21-Oct-19,"Harriet is a sincere tribute to the real-life freedom fighter. Excellent performances and a developed story add layers of entertainment. Anyone interested in documentaries or the subject material must watch this.
The story tells the heroic tale of Harriet Tubman's escape from slavery and transformation into one of America's most influential figures. The film recounts how her courage and intelligence freed hundreds of slaves and changed history as we know it.Cynthia Erivo, as Harriet Tubman, brings out something award-worthy. This actress of Broadway fame launches her star potential to greater heights as she perfectly captures Tubman's appearance on top of her distinguishing characteristics. The film is truly a vehicle for Cynthia's many talents. Other cast members include Leslie Odom Jr. as William Still and Janelle Monae as Marie. While Odom Jr.'s role is relatively one-note as someone Tubman sends runaways to, Monae adds heart to Marie as she settles Tubman for city life. As the film progresses, a heartbreaking scene sticks its landing due to the dynamic between the two.Kasi Lemmons aptly directs, as the story is told chronologically. However, the cinematography does leave a little bit more to be desired, as it lacks nuance and something of interest, during extended dialogue-heavy scenes. Due to this, I felt the runtime and was left desiring the thrilling rescues that follow. It is worth mentioning that you must be interested in American history, or else you will truly remain bored during its two-hour runtime. My favorite scene is Tubman's first escape, because a thrilling scene follows where Tubman jumps downstream into the river rather than get captured. It is truly a testament to Tubman's courage and agility.The message of this film is that Tubman always stands for justice and treats even her opponents fairly; really everything Tubman stands for speaks truth in heroic qualities. I give this film 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18 due to violence, thematic content and language, including racial slurs.Reviewed by Arjun N., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

Harriet,29-Mar-20,Fantastic job on the FIRST feature film about Harriet Tubman. All of the actors did a great job bringing this historical figure to life. This film deserved more accolades than it received.
Harriet,02-Nov-19,"This isn't an historical movie. It's propaganda of the worst kind. The Harriet lead was so bad I found myself being looked at in the theater due to busting out in laughter during some of her lines. As a history major I saw so many outright lies in this film that I'm surprised it's even labeled as a ""documentary"". The US seems to take a lot of liberties with historical facts & that is frightening. They're even trying to endure us to Hitler now. Lol. What in the world is going on in Hollyweird??"
1917,13-Dec-19,"Last night COL Ferry and I (COL Coldwell, both USA) were able to watch the new WWI film, 1917, before it has national release. It is a cinematographic feast for the eyes, long expansive shots that follow the protagonists as they execute their mission. It does not hide the horrors that existed in trench warfare, it shows them for their brutality and abundance. (My great uncle died as a consequence of his service fighting in the trenches, mustard gas poisoning). In many ways it reminded me of Saving Private Ryan.For those who have served in combat (I have deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan), I cannot tell you if the film will be too difficult to watch, it might well be, especially if incoming artillery is a trigger. For me, as the camera travels a few inches above the dirt advancing slowly up a berm, my response was visceral. I was taken back to the patrols we walked in Afghanistan, not knowing what was around the corner; not relaxing heightened vigilance, not knowing if there would be an IED, a child wearing a suicide vest, a sniper taking aim. For the protagonists in this film (as for all who served and are serving) surviving the climb up the berm, there is no sigh of relief, no respite from the fear of uncertainty. They (we) survive to move forward to face more uncertainty.Watching allowed me to pay homage to my great uncle, and the approximate 800,000 other Brits who were killed or died as a consequence of their service. (Germany lost over 2 million soldiers in the war). Estimates put the total casualty numbers for both military and civilians at 40 million, half killed or died from wounds/infection.I rate this film as 10/10, for many reasons. Directing, acting, set design, cinematography, musical score, the raw emotion it invokes. Some critics have said they never felt a connection with the characters, I suspect they never served in combat. While the brotherhood (including female War Fighters) is strong, there is also a common characteristic possessed by all War Fighters, the ability to focus on a mission and suppress emotion, even as those around the Fighter fall. This was the quality I recognized in the actors and why the viewer doesn't ""bond"" with the main protagonists; we, the viewer, were on the mission with them, we grieve as we can and move on.Watch if you will, but know there is no pleasure in watching and the film will grab you and the beginning and not let you go. Even though we know the outcome of WWI, there is no joy, there is no peace. Watch because it will allow you a glimpse at the horror and brutality of war; reflect on their service and sacrifice. Note, as we (the viewer) are ""walking"" through the trenches, glancing shots of the young soldiers shows them with flat affect, isolation, almost apathy; this is the face of ""shell shock,"" what we know call post-traumatic stress disorder.For original WW1 footage, watch ""They Shall Never Grow Old,"" an exceptional documentary."
1917,05-Jan-20,"I sat in a packed yet silent theater this morning and watched, what I believe to be, the next Academy Award winner for the Best Picture. I'm not at all a fan of war movies but I am a fan of great movies....and 1917 is a great movie.
I have never been so mesmerized by set design and direction, the mass human emotion of this film is astonishingly captured and embedded magically in the audience. It keeps running through my mind...the poetry and beauty intertwined with the raw misery of war.
Treat yourself....see this movie!"
1917,04-Jan-20,"This film is overwhelming. I have nothing further to add, other than the compelling need for eternal remembrance to those who sacrificed their lives in any way, we can not fathom. We, citizens of any country, today, should feel ourselves lucky and blessed to exist. A Happy New Year to all. George from Hellas. NB: do not give it a second thought; watch it; even if this genre is not your cup of tea. After all, it is much more than a feature film. It's a massive dedication to unselfishness. Do yourself a favour and watch it. And then watch it once more."
1917,10-Jan-20,Don't listen to the critics saying this movie is boring. This movie is one of the most tense and exciting movies I've seen in years. Amazing cinematography and overall amazing experience of a movie.
1917,07-Jan-20,"1917 is a poem.
Is the most deep, impressive and realistic way of seeing what kinds of things happened in WWI.
This movie made me leave the movies with tears in my eyes as if I have had a time travel experience to the World War I, and then waking up and realizing how wonderful are the times we are living in.
1917 is a must see movie for everyone."
1917,13-Dec-19,Guaranteed Oscar. A technical and visual triumph. Bravo Roger Deakins!
1917,12-Dec-19,"It's a stunning watch from start to finish. The amount of work that went into this film alone deserves your attendance, and even then, the story never stalls, and has a fair balance between war and humanity, and has some of the most incredible camera work I've seen in a while. It's hands down my favorite film of 2019."
1917,28-Dec-19,"This is hands down one of the greatest war movies to ever hit the silver screen along with being very unique. The hell of the WWI battlefield is a subject that hasn't been covered in a long time and Mr. Mendes executes this perfectly. A movie like this couldn't have been made 50 years ago but with today's advances in film making along with a large studio budget Mr. Mendes takes us through an adventure every bit as harrowing as Saving Private Ryan and Thin Red Line.The use of the single shot was brilliant as it brings the viewer along in the trenches and further adds to the realism to the film. I was surprised to hear that this was gimmicky effect from some critics, I feel Mr. Mendes nailed it brilliantly with the help of some fantastic cinematography. The set pieces were so realistic and detailed, a lesser director would've focused more on them but for this ride the camera never stops moving and it's a benefit to the film.There was no slow part in the movie and the audience is enthralled with the journey from the first minute of the film. The dialogue was great and certainly was a key component of making the single shot method work here. There is no pointless exposition in the movie.This isn't a piece to glorify war but rather demonstrate how one can be brave all the while showing their vulnerabilities and fear that any normal person would feel in that type of situation. There are no gratuitous bits in the film to exemplify heroism, just a simple story that allows the characters to shine and define bravery on their own terms.From the acting, to the score, to the cinematography, editing and overall direction of the film Mr. Mendes absolutely knocked it out of the park. This isn't just one of the best war movies of all time, I believe it's truly one of the best pieces of film to ever grace the big screen. 1917 will leave you breathless and for many like myself, in tears when the journey comes to and end.Bravo!!"
1917,16-Jan-20,"It still wasn't fully satisfying for me.Obviously the story is pretty much one line: deliver this message. This is ok, not every movie needs to be packed with story. But then it shouldn't waste too much time either, it should be faster paced, there should always be something to look at that's actually interesting. The stapled corpses get boring at some point.The biggest problem I had with this movie, were the unnecessary coincidences.
1) The germans take every step to not leave food or anything behind, yet there is exactly 1 cow and 1 milk bucket left. Which leads to
2) In the town the protagonist jump exactly into this 1 house wherw there's also a baby that needs this milk.
3) The rat. It just runs into the trap exactly when our protagonists are there. Of course.
4) The plane. You guessed it: It lands exactly at our heroes feet. And they decide to help the german guy (why?) which leads to Blakes death.Other than that, the movie really was spectacular and a feast for this eyes. But it is a movie with just a few too many problems to really shine for me."
1917,10-Feb-20,"Absolutely incredible - I've seen it 3 times in cinemas and each time I find myself even more in awe of, blown away by, and in love with this film. It's thrilling, tense, gentle, satisfying, and deeply beautiful. As a huge fan of the war genre, this is unlike any other film I've ever seen - it finds its true strength in its unexciting, human moments rather than in the mindless chaos of firefights, while still managing to have some of the most exhilarating and edge-of-your-seat segments I've ever seen. Schofield is a brilliant and unconventional choice for the lead character, and his empathy and softness have made him one of my favourite characters of all time and an exceptionally rare example of how quiet tenderness truly can carry a war film better than loud banter and hyper-masculine bluster so often does. Krysty Wilson-Cairns is a genius and George Mackay said so much more in Schofield's silence than most actors could hope to in the grandest monologue. A masterpiece."
1917,13-Jan-20,"It's an experience, certainly, and I do recommend seeing it in a good cinema.Deakins was fantastic, absolutely, some stunning cinematography.But I found the movie incredibly disappointing overall. Feels like a missed opportunity, a very interesting experiment that just does not quite work.Most of the movie felt like a series of Call Of Duty cut scenes, a video game you had no control over, a really odd feeling, and some of the scenes were like a video game in content with reality stretched to almost breaking point.To me it was an adventure movie rather than a 'war movie', much more like Indiana Jones than Saving Private Ryan... To relate it to another movie I felt it reminded me very much of The Revenant in story and style, but like that movie it felt rather empty to me."
1917,17-Jan-20,"I knew nothing of the film heading into the theatre other than it was based on WW1.Cinematography, lighting, yes brilliant. That of course doesn't make a film deserve an 8.7 rating.This is a war film for the Marvel generation. There is limited emotion shown by the main characters, scenes that suspend reality and cliche, cliche, cliche.Our hero finds a bucket of unspoilt milk at an abandoned farmhouse beside the only cow in sight.A trip wire is tripped by a rat in a bunker in which the two soldiers are in, one is in scratched while the other is buried under rubble, He is dragged out of the rubble with not a scratch, only to have some dust in his eyes. Yet the explosion was so significant it forces the entire large bunker to collapse.Our hero is shot at by a sniper while crossing the bridge. I thought at this point that we finally might be able to see a tense scene. In other good war films this game of cat and mouse might have lasted several minutes. No need. Our hero somehow immediately locates the position of the sniper and is able to shoot and would him. Stunning marksmanship.Yet only two scenes later our hero is running through a town in rubble being shot at by German soldiers no more than 20 yards away and isn't hit.The worst part though, even worse than the tacky scene with the French woman and child, is his escapade down the river, through the rapids, and down a waterfall only the exit the river right at the point at which the battalion he was attempting to locate is luckily only 15 yards away.Things just seem to randomly work out for our hero, and quickly. There needed to be a few sequences where the hero is faced with the enormity of the situation, loneliness, desolation. Rather each time one chapter is finished he is immediately assisted in movies to the next.This film pales in comparison to films like Saving Private Ryan and Platoon. An opportunity lost. I left the cinema modestly entertained yet empty and disappointed."
1917,18-Jan-20,"First let me say the beginning sequences were shot almost perfectly. I was really into the first 20-25 minutes of the movie. I was engaged and thinking about how I was going to tell my sons that if they get a chance to go watch it in the theater. The cinematography and music were gripping.
Then..... as the 2 main characters (solider A and soldier B) get through the initial German traps, and enter into an open field with a cow, a barn, and a pale of fresh milk, the movie goes down hill fast. I was literally laughing at the ridiculousness of the plot and situations. A & B, whose duty it is to transport a message to (2) battalions, warning the battalions are falling into a German trap. Soldier A, has an older brother who is possibly going to be slaughtered in the trap.
With the cow and milk pale in the background, A & B find themselves helping a German airplane pilot out of his burning plane after witnessing an aerial dog fight. This is right after they go through hundreds of yards of seeing their dead countrymen. This is also after they almost get blown up (should have been into 1000 pieces) from booty traps (goonies reference). They help the German guy? Help him? Well, the German guy proceeds to knife Soldier A and kill him. That sequence made me almost leave the theater. I should have because the remaining parts of the movie just got worse. Soldier B still had a message to deliver. B proceeded to get picked up by a convoy of English Soldiers in trucks, who showed up a split second after the cow, milk, plane sequence. As if the trucks showing up was not ridiculous enough, the truck B was in got stuck in the mud moments later. B then convinces 15 or so other soldiers to help him push it out of the mud. Well, they miraculously do this, only to find that they can drive another few hundred yards.
Our message delivering solider B leaves them and then now has to make it past the storm trooper German snipers. I call them storm troopers, because just like storm troopers, they are unable to hit their target. On one of the first sniper situations, the sniper gets hit by a bullet, so B thinks. However, when B goes to check to see if he shot the sniper, he opens the door full swing with his entire body facing the wounded sniper. B then takes a bullet? Or something happens where he gets knocked back down a small flight of stairs. After he wakes, he evades some more storm troopers, then kicks open a small horizontal door to find a woman and a baby, along with a beautiful fire. Thankfully B had fresh milk.
B then leaves as it is getting close to morning. He evades a couple storm troopers only to find a younger storm trooper that he tries to shush. B actually puts his finger up to the storm trooper to shush him? Huh? Was this part of Jedi training? When that doesn't work he chokes him instead. Much to B's surprise, the choking worked better than the shushing. Go figure?
B then runs and runs evading lots of lots of laser guns. Oops sorry, bullets. Then he jumps into a raging river where he smashes his head. Thankfully he has a hard head.
If that is not silly enough, the rivers puts him exactly where he needs to be. Right up to a Battalion sitting in a large circle, listening to a guy singing. UGH, that was so bad.
B still needs to get his dry message that was soaked in the river to the commander. He proceeds to evade lots of bombs from enemy fire to do this. But thankfully B makes it. A cameo by Benedict Cumberbatch as the commander cannot save this flop.
B saves the second wave. B meets A's brother, even though he was in the first wave that was already deployed and supposed to be slaughtered.I just have to say why? Why do we need to accept these movies and call them Oscar winners? Yes, the cinematography should get an award possibly. Maybe the score. But the overall movie was just plain terrible."
1917,17-Jan-20,"The one-shot look of this movie was interesting. Wasn't sure if I was going to like that that approach to filming but it worked for this film.The movie looked fantastic and the scenes and shots were breath taking. Sound and music score really helped a viewer on an emotional level as well.While I was engrossed and drawn into this film from start to finish, after it was over and I had time to reflect on it, I found it not the profound masterpiece others have stated it as.The plot in general was unrealistic - there are better ways to deliver a message than sending two soldiers across enemy lines and relying on luck and hope.Some of the scenes dragged as well, which caused the movie to lose momentum for me. Felt the build up often yes, but then there would be scene that made me lose interest (truck ride. French woman & baby).Acting wasn't spectacular either, from anyone in the film. You can have all the explosions and battle scenes you want that look great, but if the actors can't carry the script along it won't work as a whole. This is why the comparisons that mention Saving Private Ryan don't work for me - those actors drew you in with their performances. That didn't happen here, and between the acting and the momentum losing scenes, is why I cant rate this film any higher.Close, but missed the mark for a perfect film, but a good watch none the less."
1917,06-Dec-19,"Sam Mendes' war drama is set during World War I and very personal to him, as it tells a story his grandfather used to tell him when he was still a young lad. Dedicated to Mendes' hero, this drama cuts deep when we join two young soldiers on a mission to deliver a message that could possibly save thousands of fellow combatants.Filmed and edited as if it was one long take, the camera never leaves our main protagonists, Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) and Schofield (George MacKay), out of its sight. Mendes (Skyfall) and co-writer Krysty Wilson-Cairns (Penny Dreadful) therefore corner themselves by relying on this kind of linear storytelling, to tell a very focused but at times a somewhat thin tale. Some of the scenes are so empty, it will for sure test audiences' patience. Technical, '1917' is a true feast for the eyes and ears.Roger Deakins' (Blade Runner 2049) cinematography is once again breathtakingly superior to anything else you've seen this year, and for sure will be the one thing people unanimously praise. Sound editing/mixing, visual effects and production design are all outstanding. These are the things, people will remember. It is Thomas Newman's (Passengers) score that elevates every moment happening in front of you, intensifying the emotions brought by our main characters. And although MacKay (Captain Fantastic) and Chapman (Game of Thrones) do a pretty phenomenal job at capturing the true essence of their characters going through a literal hell, it's the side characters with little-to-no screen time who steal their spotlight. Andrew Scott (Fleabag), Mark Strong (Shazam!), Richard Madden (Rocketman) and Benedict Cumberbatch (Dr. Strange) are checkpoints along the way, but man, do they impress with the few lines they're given.1917 is without a doubt a technical masterpiece, that will inspire many filmmakers, but I can't feel a bit let down. As an overall film, it wants to play a heavy tune on your heartstrings, but can't reach that level of sentiment, because the focus on technicalities pulled me out of the story. It for sure is one of the better films 2019 has brought to the big screen, yet a bit more focus on the script could've made this the cinematic masterpiece of the decade. Nonetheless, I recommend watching this on the biggest screen possible and enjoy another fine piece of cinema brought to you by Sam Mendes."
1917,12-Jan-20,"1917 is a very good film in general, but it's the way it's shot that marks it as an artistically cutting-edge film. It brings the technical excellence of Dunkirk, with great war sets and brutally realistic depictions of the intensity of war, but intelligently turns to a humanist angle in telling a simple story of two men trying to help their country's men. There are no bad elements of 1917, but it's the phenomenal execution of the one-shot technique that makes it great. The tracking shots in the trenches made me realize how much less immersive it is to be constantly cut to the front of the next shot, rather than seeing the path the characters take. Given that it's this one epic journey, it is fitting to go on it with Schofield the whole way. The colors and big war shots (especially Schofield running across the war zone to reach the captain and him jumping into the river) were gorgeous. The score is essential, ratcheting tension up quickly in scenes like the rat trip wire and also calming it down in personal scenes like one character's death and when Schofield meets the baby and woman. War is so extreme and all-encompassing that it's truly difficult for any film to accurately capture it, but 1917 belongs up there with the best efforts. It is a film of brutality and loyalty, but above all it's a beautiful work of art about one of the ugliest subjects known to man."
1917,05-Dec-19,I saw a preview screening about two hours ago and I am still in shock. This is the best war movie I have seen in a decade. The shots Mendes uses and what he demands of his actors is nothing short of incredible. If you get a chance this will probably be the last must see movie of 2019. I will be seeing this again on release.
1917,14-Jan-20,"The effort Sam Mendes has gone to to create an authentic WW1 setting is astonishing. The scenes of the trenches, dead horses, bomb craters etc really put you in the scenes, and I was blown away by the film from a visual point of view. My problem is that the plot holes in the story were as big as some of the bomb craters. And after leaving, I realised they were too many and obvious to allow me to enjoy the film. (I'm about to reveal spoilers, so don't read on if you haven't seen it).
So we all know that it's true that German forces retreated from trenches at times. As the distance between allied and opposing forces was as matter of yards in many cases, the fact they had abandoned their line would have been obvious over a relatively short period of time to the allies, because of air and recon intelligence.
When the rat triggered the trip wire, both men were literally on top of the trap. It was a big enough explosion to collapse the entire tunnel, but they both survived without a scratch.
After the pilot killed Blake, almost straight away, Schofield was suddenly joined by a huge troop of British Allies. Where did they come from? Why didn't they just take the message?
When they drop Schofield off, he immediately starts getting sniped, while the troops are presumably right next to him. Why didn't they shoot back to help? Where did they disappear to?
When Schofield is being chased, he kicks a door through in clear view of his pursuer, and the pursuer just runs on. Leaving Schofield to spend a random night with a woman and baby who happened to be surviving on their own with no food and water, hidden in the same ruins as German troops.
There are more. I won't labour the point, but once you start seeing the flaws, they just all add up to make what is a beautiful film just too implausible for me."
1917,04-Dec-19,"The entire movie made to look like it's shot at one single take, this is possible because of extraordinary talented 14 times Academy Award nominee cinematographer Roger Deakins. This man is a genius, the movie is shot beautifully. it is mesmerizing to a watch world war 1 movie like it is happening right in front of you. The pacing is phenomenal. The only real flaw in the movie is that there are no great character building movements like other war movies but that is also intentional because, the main intention or motive is to save lives and not focus on characters in the movie and that works."
1917,26-Apr-20,"Yeah I get it, this movie looks great, with top notch cinematography. And the movie is supposed to look like one continuous shot, sure. But unfortunately that's all this movie has going for it. I was going into this movie expecting something that rivals the likes of Saving PVT Ryan, Platoon, hell even We Were Soldiers, but 1917 didn't even come close to any of these movies mentioned. This movie tells a simple story, which you pretty much have figured out about 15 minutes going in, not a lot of suspense or drama in the whole movie. This movie would make a decent flick if you haven't seen many war movies. But if your one of those who have seen many throughout the years, I don't think you'll be too impressed."
1917,17-Jan-20,"Sure, it had a few good cinematic shots.But the story felt hollow - cardboard cutout characters - generic message delivery through enemy lands. Almost feel like they did it by the numbers."
1917,17-Jan-20,"Saving Private Ryan, 30 Seconds over Tokyo, Patton, Inglorious Bastards, The Great Escape and Schindler's List are only a few of the countless movies about World War II that have been made. In fact, many are still made today. So why haven't there been a lot of movies about the first World War? I think it comes down to exactly what was being fought for and what it meant for everyone. Everyone can agree that Nazism is bad and running a nation as a dictatorship robs everyone of their freedom. Germany was a common enemy that everyone would want to fight, similar to a simple film's goal of good against evil.While World War I may have not had a simple enemy to get behind, it's still an important war as it collapsed several European empires, set the stage for a revolution in Russia, put the U.S. in a larger military position and unfortunately led to the deaths of millions. What movies can do is really put us in the position of those solders to see the magnitude of warfare and it's path of devastation. This may make 1917 one of the most intense movies to sit through, but an important one to witness.In the misty month of April in 1917, English soldiers are resting after seeing the Germans pulling back from the western front. Two solders, Blake (played by Dean-Charles Chapman) and Schofield (played by George MacKay) are assigned to deliver a message to another Battalion. They receive more information from General Erinmore (played by Colin Firth), where they find out that the 2nd Battalion , which is assuming an easy victory, is about to walk into a deadly battle with most of the German offensive attacking there. With the phone lines cut, both Blake and Schofield are instructed to cross No Man's Land to find the Battalion and deliver a message to not attack.Plot wise, that's all you need to know about 1917. The rest of the movie follows these two men as they cross over the horror that is No Man's Land, abandoned German trenches and everything else that would scare any soldier crossing the lines. What separates this from a lot of other war movies is that the entire film is created to appear that everything is done in one continuous shot, never taking the perspective away from the main characters. This also includes time and light, depending whether it's day or night.Even with it's ambition, 1917 is still a phenomenal movie that's an experience that gave my heart a large rush. Director Sam Mendes (American Beauty, Skyfall) clearly wanted to give audiences the best way to experience the trenches and gunshots and did so through this one shot story. Birdman may have done something similar, but given how many extras and special effects went off, I would love to see a behind the scenes look at how everything was done. The cinematography pays a lot of detail to little things like the color of the sky during sunrise and how much paler skin would become after death.The story feels a lot like something out of theme park or a video game...and I mean that in a good way. You're aware that your watching someone else's experience , but the right angles do make you feel like you're a part of it. Where 1917 endures in the story is it's simple goal while going through several layers of warfare Hell. I could see this getting boring quick, but despite it's one shot goal, every scene still has a different look that never feels too familiar. The movie knows not to stop for too long unless it was for an important reason. It's a rush.Does this movie into the bigger political or social impact of World War I? No, but that was never the intention. It's like watching someone's small story that is large in scale. If I did have any problems is that there's a point where a character is knocked out and he's awoken. I won't say where, but it broke part of the spell that the movie put me in. You can tell it's a point where they were hiding an edit, but if the movie had a bunch of them in plain sight, you'd think they could have done better.I'll give this eight dogfight planes out of ten. Like a lot of war movies, this isn't a pleasant experience. It isn't supposed to be; it's meant to be a tool to really give you something that a lot of people have forgotten about as WWI movies aren't made a lot. I highly recommend this if your willing to see something that I can't say I could make myself."
1917,03-Feb-20,"1917 is a brilliant adventure film, which was released in the 1. World War. Apart from an emotionally charged story, realistic dialogues and well acted characters, the movie offers a masterpiece of craftsmanship. Roger Deakins behind the camera manages to create a gripping experience through unique images and consistent camera work close to the main characters. Moreover, the sets seem to be taken from real life and make the viewer feel as if they are at war themselves."
1917,13-Mar-20,Great cinematography. Best part for me was the first 15 minutes. The film loses a bit of steam in the final act but the journey to get there is enjoyable and technically brilliant.
1917,13-Jan-20,"Every warfilm that gets released people instantly jump on the ""cliche"" band wagon. War is war and always will be so ofcourse there will be similarities so just get over it..
I'm a huge warfilm buff and being in the military I see more things in war movies that annoy me than an regular person but I dont let them reuin the entertainment side.
If you dont want a cliche dont watch a war film simple.
Back to the topic, 1917 is epic.
Totally gripping through the entire movie it blew my mind. It truly was a techincal mastepeice and deserves every acolade it gets.
Cannot wait fir 4k with an atmos mix!"
Desperados,03-Jul-20,"This movies premise is very old and kinda been done a lot of times already.It is one of the more boring ones, I found my self not really watching it but rather just letting it wash over me. There was nothing to grasp onto.Then I realised that the dialogue was terrible. It was so unfunny and bad. The delivery of the lines was also not great but I do wonder if they were like ""I can't believe they are making me say this"".The plot is also paper thin and at times I think got bored of it's self as it kinda wanders off and does irrelevant things then hopes back to what it was meant to be focusing on.I read that this movie has been in development since 2009 that is a long time ago, 11 years. I think it shows as it isn't anything fresh unfortunately and I really like most of the leads."
Desperados,04-Jul-20,"Yes, there's a scene where a dolphin eagerly humps Nasim Pedrad and then slaps her in the face with his dolphin dick and that aptly represents the general flavour of humour in yet another fairly terrible Netflix original.I'm giving this a 4 out of ten because there were a couple of funny scenes and the cast and set were well styled, but the screen writing, ugh.. the screen writing!!! ... as usual in these scraping the bottom of the barrel originals... was complete garbage."
Desperados,04-Jul-20,"This movie is nothing but cliches, bad acting, and recycled tropes. The dynamic between the woman playing the main character and the little boy at the resort is creepy and inappropriate exploitation of a minor actor."
Desperados,08-Jul-20,"I'll start by stating my 2 star rating is only due to loving most of the actors in the film. I would have thought this combination would have gone off much better than it did.The storyline is painfully erratic, with nothing to really grab on to. Instead of enjoying the experience you'll kind of just waste time watching something without taking anything from it to remember. In other words, it's a total waste of an hour and a half of your life that you'll never get back - and that's saying a lot while most of us are stuck at home in quarantine with too much free time.It's a shame they brought together this great group and missed the mark entirely on a story of any sort.Also, what's with the uncomfortable child/ adult live connection joke? It was cringeworthy at the first sentence and they kept it going throughout a decent length of the film. I don't know how this script ever got the green light.If you're looking for a great Netflix comedy, this isn't it. It's not even decent. Instead , I recommend you watch Eurovision Song Contest: the story of Fire Saga - it'll bring you laughs and even some tears of joy."
Desperados,04-Jul-20,"Congratulations, this movie was so bad it actually moved me to write a review.Desperadoes was a train wreck from start to cgi dolphin dong and then went downhill from there.
Whichever scriptwriter came up with this needs to go on strike again and I truly hope none of those involved (and to be clear, I previously liked all three of the 'recognisable' faces in this) ever live it down.Early and guaranteed winner of the Worst Movie of the 21st century."
Desperados,06-Jul-20,"I turned this in because I love Nasim Pedrad. The trailer looked funny. But it was absolutely awful. There were a couple funny moments, but most of jokes were not funny and completely gross. The plot was painful and ridiculous."
Desperados,03-Jul-20,"Seriously,, just dont waste your time watching this, i usually can bear a pathetic movie by doing a fast forward but this just broke my patience on all levels.. Do something unproductive or stupid to pass your time rather wasting it by watching this! You'll thank me later."
Desperados,05-Jul-20,"As soon as I saw Sean at the same resort as her I knew exactly what was going to happen. The whole little boy thing was really creepy and not needed. I feel like the film was way too long. I really wanted to like this film, I watched the preview on Netflix and it looked good. but it's so cringe. Typical friends falling out over something stupid. Making up. Her finding the man of her dreams."
Desperados,16-Jul-20,"Not completely awful, a few humorous scenes and good cinematography, but on the whole unfunny. The jokes land painfully flat, leaving this movie very one note and lacking purpose. The storyline is very cliche and the main characters have no chemistry."
Desperados,05-Jul-20,"It is dull with an uninspired story line, questionable acting and an ending you can predict in the first 10 minutes."
Desperados,10-Jul-20,Why does Netflix keep making movies like this? Lamorne Morris is charming but the rest of the movie was painful to watch.
Desperados,04-Jul-20,2020 is just so sad for so many people and this movie didn't help uplift the those who subscribed in Netflix during lockdown.
Desperados,11-Jul-20,"And they say The Room is the worst? I actually watched The Room with curiosity and weird excitement. And this? I felt like I want to punch screen of my laptop every 5 minutes.I honestly don't even know where to start... Everything about the movies is ridiculous. First of all the plot- so flat, predictable and banal that you just want it to finish before it stars. In a bad way. Not like The end of the world ridiculous, funny and silly way. It's like a copy of every simple comedy with decent characters combined into not funny, boring, bad shot and bad acted movie. No chemistry between actors whatsoever- the only character carrying the weight of decency is Sean- probably the only positive aspect of this movie. Dialogue horrible- sounds like written by acting students on a Sunday night for a Monday assignment. Honestly. I'm not even mean. Do not hope for a single lough- it's not gonna happen. Bad plot, no chemistry, flat, boring and too long. I feel like this movie sucked piece of my soul away and threw to a sewer."
Desperados,15-Jul-20,Decent movie but was disappointed in the storyline. Was obvious what was going to happen right from start if the movie. Did not love the main character either
Desperados,03-Jul-20,"... they resort to dialog loaded with the f.. word, vulgarity and mentions of sex.This formula is simple and has been used ad nauseam. But once one removes these elements from the dialog, there is very little left behind.In the case of In ""Desperado"" there is zero, nada, zilch.... I was surprised they did not show some boobage to try and fill the time.Too bad the rating system does not allow negative scores, for ""Desperado"" deserves -100!"
Desperados,07-Jul-20,"I'm not sure what the huge number of complaints are about, this is exactly as advertised and hardly the dumpster fire it's being panned as.Chick flick, buddy, rom-com with a decent cast and light story. Is this some Oscar worthy masterpiece? No. Is it a fun watch to distract you from the actual nightmare that is 2020? Yes, yes it is."
Desperados,17-Jul-20,"Yes, it is a rom co. Yes, the plot is predictable. Yes, it is a waste of time. It could be bearable if not the performance of the main character. It was so poor, I have no idea who had the decency to release that movie. The character plays 35 years old, but she looks like 45 old man with all the fillers. The movie tries to be funny, but it fails miserably."
Desperados,16-Jul-20,"Bad movie, bad acting, awful plot.... it's like the main actress wrote this film herself so she can star in it. I gave it an extra star for the guy who plays Sean cause I liked him in new girl. Anyways the movie was not worth watching."
Desperados,10-Jul-20,"There is so many good rom coms out there, just avoid this one. It's just terrible. Your partner maybe like let's just make our own minds up. DONT. Maybe two funny moments and the rest is just awful. We have to live with our mistake don't fall into the same trap."
Desperados,07-Jul-20,If you watched the preview then you should know the movie you are watching... it's not expected to be a work of art.
Desperados,05-Jul-20,"In my opinion, romantic comedies by their very nature can only be so good. The plots are formulaic and rarely take anyone by surprise.
That being said, this was a solid romcom. I think its better the the 5/10 stars it's gotten, and it did have a better b-story dynamic than most. If you like a fun romcom now and then, worth the watch."
Desperados,06-Jul-20,"Netflix just can't make a single thing right these days! They became a lame rubbish producing house, like a frat version from Hollywood! Its just one absurd and ridiculous work after another! Please do everybody a favor and stop doing this bs craps!!!"
Desperados,03-Jul-20,"The entire movie is in the trailer, and even that was too much for me. I can't even believe this was made. I was trying to think of situations in which the writers would have been in too much of a hurry to come up with a better story, but nothing came to mind. Even a kid writing a book report on the bus to school on the morning it is due could come up with a better product. Even if the writers had only been allotted the amount of time of the trailer to write the entire script, they should have done better, even if they were all morbidly hung over.It's the old ""unsend an email"" plot that has been done a million times. Spoiler Alert: it was stupid the first time they did it, so imagine the same premise now. Yeah, neither can I.If you get down to the absolute bottom of the barrel in movie ideas, you'd still need to dig another couple of miles to reach the place where they discovered this script. It's like the moral equivalent of turning a knock-knock joke into a feature film."
Desperados,07-Jul-20,It seems a 2000's movie on a budget. I've never laughed once while watching it and I felt bad for the actors. I didn't stop because the cast is good and I wanted for the movie to get better. The whole crazyness about the kid and the protagonist was gross and inappropriate.
Desperados,04-Jul-20,"It starts super quick. Establishes all the characters and their relationships within the first 15 and then the film gets going. But then it just drags you realise where the film is going to go about an hour or so from it ending. It also didn't help that the lead had no charisma and had no chemistry with her best friends. It really shows when the two friends go off on their own and they have a lot of chemistry. Also the film isn't funny enough there really isn't many jokes, aside from a few clever visual gags. Including a really clever passing of time display involving birth control pill being taken. The romance wasn't strong enough either to really be invested in. With either romantic interest. It was really just far too long, not interesting enough and a real waste of time."
Back to the Future,17-Apr-17,"What can I say about this movie that was already said? It is my favorite time travel sci-fi, adventure epic comedy in the 80's and I love this movie to death! When I saw this movie I was thrown out by its theme. An excellent sci-fi, adventure epic, I LOVE the 80s. It's simple the greatest time travel movie ever happened in the history of world cinema. I love this movie to death, I love, LOVE, love it! I firstly saw this movie in the early 90's as a kid on VHS tape and I was blow away by the action and the score and the title back to the future. This movie is one of the best masterpiece time travel epic adventure film. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are fantastic at acting. Music theme score by Alan Silvestri is excellent I could listen to it whole day.Back to the Future (1985) From the Academy Award ""- winning team of Steven Spielberg"" and Robert Zemeckis** comes the hilariously groundbreaking adventure that thrilled critics and audiences alike - and sparked one of the most successful movie trilogy ever! Directed by Robert Zemeckis the movie begins with Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) a teenager who has a really messed up family. His ultimate goal was to become a rock star which was heartened by his girl friend Jennifer Parker (Claudia Wells). But things went wrong when scientist Dr. Emmett Brown/Doc (Christopher Lloyd) wanted Marty's assistance for his new invention.At that night Marty went to assist Doc's invention the Time traveling Car ""DeLorean"". Marty was told to record Doc's first time travel to the future. At that instant they were attacked by some Libyan terrorists who were cheated by Doc for Plutonium.After killing Doc they turn towards to Marty and without any intention Marty enters the Time Traveling car. But it was previously set by Doc and when activated Marty gets transfer to 1955 from 1985.What will he do next, will he can come back to the future, or will he stuck back in the past for his rest of the life. More than that will his time travel make serious effects on the future? Dealing with time travel and time paradox Steven Spielberg presents this amazing journey of Marty set up in the time of 80's and 50's. Scripted by Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale for the story of Bob Gale himself, tells a science fiction adventure in a family oriented tone.They really work hard to sculpt that sci-fi thread into a thrilling, culture clashed family movie. A good story with a great script. Also the soul of the movie was given by the legend Alan Silvestri. His composition was all memorable especially in the chasing and emotional scenes. Over the top the theme music, it was the most dazzling and recognizable themes in the movie history.More than that the casting was simply brilliant, each and every actor is born to play their respected roles in this movie. Michael J. Fox was the only actor who can play the role of energetic Marty McFly, which was considered for numerous actors. Also Thomas F. Wilson was brilliant in his performance as the Bad boy Biff Tannen. Lea Thompson did a great work in portraying Lorraine Baines's two different life times, as a teenage girl and a matured mother. Well the extra talented Christopher Lloyd had almost ""chewed every scenes"" in the movie. Mr. Lloyd's versatile performance as the madman and genius scientist Dr. Emmett Brown is one of the great memorable roles in his carrier.Last but not the least, it was Crispin Glover who steal the show as the nerdy teenager/father as George McFly. It was an interesting portrayal as a boy who was transformed to a man. Crispin Glover lived in that part. I don't know whether the movie would be a masterpiece without his unique performance. Above all I want to remember this as a romantic movie and it couldn't be made without the songs ""The Power of Love,"" and ""Earth Angel"".The rating I am giving is 10/10 the original and the best one of all time. I love this film, it is my favorite time travel movie of all time and I love it to death! All in all it is the greatest sci-fi, romantic movie of all time. It is the part of the great Movie History, which consider itself as "" A Modern/Classic Masterpiece! """
Back to the Future,01-Jun-00,"Back To The Future is such an inventive and exciting piece of filmmaking that it is impossible to forget about it. The casting of every character involved was absolutely perfect, and the performances were spectacular. I first saw this film when I was six years old, and it is the only movie that I know of that I don't think I could ever get sick of.
One of the best things about Back To The Future is that it really makes you think. You can have in-depth conversations about the plausibility of the story-line and spend hours discussing the film. The story is awesome, it is delivered cleverly and entertainingly, and the movie as a whole is just so much FUN that it can be forgiven whatever number of time-travel discrepancies that may be found in the plot. I cannot recommend this movie enough. I have never found a movie other than this one that provides such a huge dose of great fun, and it has the desirable quality where you are able to see something new each time you see it. The only problem is that they stopped at part III."
Back to the Future,08-Feb-01,"Back To The Future (1985) is my all time favourite movie. It's a thoroughly feel good film, accessible to all ages and enjoyable from the 1st to the 45th time of watching and never fails to bring a smile.  Humour for all ages and a kick-ass car to boot, what more could a young kid want? Or those young at heart?From Marty's ""Johnny B Goode"" to Doc's classic ""Run For It Marty!"" You'll find that even though you know what's coming next, you'll still laugh. It is the ultimate feel good movie, the weed overcomes the bully, the dreamers wishes come true and all because a nosey old bird thrusts for a nickel ""Save The Clock Tower!""It's popularity spawned 2 sequels and although it got decreasingly good in terms of quality as a film, Back To The Future remains the best film in my repetoire and a safe bet when you need to feel good.It gets a solid 9 out of 10, comedy, fantasy, the gorgeous Lea Thompson, the insane but comic Doc and the typical teenager Marty make this film a must for all young at heart."
Back to the Future,29-Jul-08,"Zemeckis's 'Back To The Future' trilogy has been a childhood favourite for a long time. Having revisited it today, brought me to a nostalgic state. The 80's saw a lot of excellent original fun 'young' films like 'Back To The Future' (of course), 'Better Off Dead', 'Heathers', 'The Breakfast Club' etc. What really made these films immensely enjoyable then, and classics today, is that they really reflected what it was like being a young person in the 80s. The movies themselves were well written, well executed, well acted and they cut straight to the point.Back to 'Back To The Future'. This one is sheer fun, even today. There's an incredible energy about it but it still manages to stay an 'innocent' film. The music is very effective. It's slick and follows a steady pace. The special effects are decent. Though people might pick on the plausibility of the time travelling, I think this is really a very minor flaw because it is overall a well written movie and the point was to entertain. Yet, this is not to say that it's brainless entertainment. I think it cleverly brings forth some interesting themes and I liked how they funnily used some ideas of Oedipus Rex's story.The acting is superb overall. Christopher Lloyd as the over-the-top mad scientist is a laugh riot. Michael J. Fox totally owns Marty McFly with his natural charisma, raw energy and brilliant dialogue delivery. Lea Thompson is cute and vivacious and Crispin Glover is good.'Back To The Future' is one of the most enjoyable time-travelling classics. It's over 23 years old and it still hasn't gotten old. Sadly, they don't make it like this these days but then again we always can revisit them. That's why they're classics."
Back to the Future,18-Apr-00,"A funny sci-fi? Unusual but here it not only works but does so spectacularly. A whimsical but very clever time travel story that bedazzles you leaving you wanting more.The charasmatic Michael J Fox plays a wonderful bumbling high schooler searching for love, a guitar gig and his existence which he himself threatens to erase.Clever and humourous references litter this fun flick; references which are further improved upon in the sequels. Views of the same scenes from different angles, different perspectives and different timelines abound.Fun for the entire family."
Back to the Future,28-Nov-04,"One of the last movies I went with sister to see back in 86. The film blew my mind. My friends never wanted to see this one. I was happy I went. Many year's latter, I bought ""Back to the Future"" at Mc Donalds for $2.99 or for some other low price with a meal. The film ages well, and I love it just the same. The director and screen writer mixes science fiction, humor, and action perfectly. A big component of the script is time line theory which drives the story. Marty has many problems to fix, and finds out more than anyone wants to know about their parents. Michael J Fox and Christopher Loyd were excellently casted. Marty and Doc what a chemistry. With the film series one see the many dualities with time travel, that become a constant with the movie. The town clock, being awoke in a strange place, and letters. Keep this in mind when watching the 2 other sequels. The theory that time repeats itself is evident. What a time machine, the Delorian adds to this movie. Worth watch over again. 10 out of 10! Thank you TBS for showing all 3 films."
Back to the Future,21-Jul-15,"As a child, I used to watch this movie religiously. I loved the chemistry between Doc Brown and Marty McFly, I loved the all too familiar soundtrack and the ridiculous way in which George McFly laughs. This movie has become such a nostalgic and feel-good film for me. I had the good fortunate to see all three 'Back to the Future' movies in cinema last year and it was such an experience to watch this timeless classic with people who enjoy this film as much as I do. Everyone has to see this film at least once in their life! Such an amazing, funny Sci-Fi from the 1980's. I just can't get enough of this movie - it will just never get old. Cannot recommend it enough!"
Back to the Future,27-Feb-03,"BACK TO THE FUTURE (1985) **** Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, Crispin Glover, Thomas F. Wilson, Marc McClure, Wendy Jo Sperber. This generation's ""It's a Wonderful Life""?  Think about it.  Very popular and very entertaining sci-fi comedy that made Fox a movie star after success with tv's ""Family Ties"", casting him, after Eric Stoltz was dropped, as Marty McFly who winds up in a nuclear-powered DeLorean time-machine and is sent back in time to 1955 by his quintessentially eccentric friend Dr. Emmet Brown (Lloyd doing a fine Art Carney).  There he meets up with his parents to be and realizes his chance encounters have changed his future and he must see history repeat itself or perish.  High-concept hilarity and some truly ingenious schematics thanks to screenwriter Bob Gale and director Bob Zemeckis.  Wondering what it would be like to never be born and/or what it would be like if things were different...see what I mean.  Oscar-nominated song ""The Power of Love"" by Huey Lewis (who has a fun cameo) fuels this dynamo gem of a film.  Classic."
Back to the Future,19-Nov-14,"A young man (Michael J. Fox) is accidentally sent thirty years into the past in a time-traveling DeLorean invented by his friend, Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd), and must make sure his high-school-age parents unite in order to save his own existence.After almost thirty years (2014), this film loses none of its charm, and actually gains respect. The movie has had such a strong impression on everyone, whether they have seen it or not, as it completely permeated pop culture.The script is genius, not only how it parallels 1955 and 1985 (some of the references are dynamite), but how it set the scene for the sequels (despite allegedly not intending to have any). This is just one clever gag after another, and may require repeated viewings to catch them all."
Back to the Future,04-Jun-02,"Time travel movies never disappoint-that is because the concept of time travel is a very interesting one which most people must have thought about at one time or another. What would happen if you went back in time and an innocuous act changed the course of history for better or worse? It's something to think about.I won't reveal any plot details for this movie because it will spoil it for those who haven't seen it. Let's just say that Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly ends up back in 1955 where a sequence of events inadvertently orchestrated by Marty threaten his very existence. He is aided by Doc Brown played brilliantly by Christopher Lloyd who tries to get him back to 1985 without causing any damage to the fabric of time.The movie is great-and I feel it can be enjoyed by anyone regardless of their individual tastes in film genres. In fact, I find it hard to believe anyone could dislike a film like this. It has action, adventure, plenty of humour and some cool moments. All the actors involved in the movie play their parts great.Anyone who watches this movie will love it."
Back to the Future,11-Jan-07,"When you talk about Back to the Future, you have to talk about the whole trilogy. Because Zemeckis and Gale didn't make sequels they extended the length of one film, which is very different than a sequel.The ultimate film must allow the audience feel part of the film and relate to the characters. This film is the best because it takes a fantasy story and makes it adaptable to real-life. I don't know how soon anyone will be able to time-travel, but you can relate to Marty McFly's (Michael J. Fox) reaction to the change. Even if you're not a teenager you can believe it in someway. Back to the Future is the perfect and its been extended into a masterpiece with 2 sequels or extensions as I see it. Definitely a must see, if your pathetic enough not to have seen in at least the last 8 years.Amazing story by Gale and Zemeckis. Great acting especially by Michael J. Fox, but also great work by Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson and Tom Wilson. Such an exciting an involved story."
Back to the Future,30-Nov-15,"This is without a doubt, my favorite movie of all time. Back to the future stars': Micheal.J.Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson and Crispin lover just to name a few. I did that without checking ether which proves that I've seen this movie WAY to many times in a week (6 times to be exact). Lets get to the plot.It's about a kid who gets sent to the past, accidentally stop his parents falling in love and seducing his mum? Creepy.Real talk time!!!! (A time when I talk about whats good/bad about a movie) The Cajigger: (main plot item) it is the DeLorian the coolest time vehicle ever made. 88/100The feel: this move irradiates 80s' it has the cool guitarist, it has the girls with weird hair, it has the teen which just wants to rock 'n' roll... PARTY ON.The Doc: he is the equivalent of mixing Dr Frankenstein, Mel Brooks and Dr Evil. You get the idea. A funny, crazy scientist. It's as epic as it sounds.This movie is easily the best time travel movie and even the best movie ever made.don't do yourself a disservice and not watch it. GO WATCH IT."
Back to the Future,03-Nov-05,"This film is just one of a kind. The charm and wit are so good it will have you wonder how they came up with such a concept, Michael J Fox is at his best as are the rest of the cast. Humour,comedy, science fiction, this film has it all. This film will remain timeless,I would urge anyone who loves films to add this one to their list now. The special effects are still great looking and look far better then most effects today, your heart will still be in your mouth when Marty races towards the clock tower in a bid to get struck by lightning, this is a film you will watch again and again and will always put a smile on your face."
Back to the Future,09-Mar-13,"Back to the future is probably one of the best movies if not the best movie I have ever seen. This movie is just fantastic, awesome and flawless. The action and suspense of this movie still excites to this day. You can watch this movie over and over again and still be thrilled. Most likely This is easily one of the best movies ever made. A must watch movie for anybody, any age, even if they aren't a very big movie person. Not much more to say.The movie has almost no flaws at all, and will not disappoint anybody who views it. A true classic that will endlessly entertain anyone. Overall a truly entertaining, memorable and amazing movie with very few flaws. Ten out of Ten stars."
Back to the Future,01-Dec-06,"I just asked my friend that I'm speaking with through instant messenger if he had ever seen ""Back to the Future"" and he said ""Yeah, who hasn't?"", sadly, I never had the opportunity until tonite and he called me a failure as a movie buff, well, at least I've seen the movies now! Ha ha! I'm back on track! Well, obviously, this is my first review for the first Back to the Future and when I came her to IMDb, I knew this was a well loved movie, I was just amazed at it being on the top 250, but I can't give it a lower rating because Back to the Future was an excellent film that was ground breaking for it's time and still today.Marty McFly and his good friend, The Doc, are two science nuts. Marty isn't really happy with his home life and the fact that he and his parents are very square and strict, The Doc calls Marty and shows him his latest invention, his De Lauren that he built into a time machine. When the government go after The Doc and Marty has to get away, he jumps in the car and goes back to the year of 1955, when his parents met. Instead of the way his mom and dad met happening to his dad, he ends up being in the position and mom ends up falling for her son, not even knowing! But he has to make sure his parents are together in time so he can get back without altering the future.Back to the Future to this day is still a timeless treasure that I notice more and more is becoming part of a newer generation. Michael J. Fox should be proud, his work will be remembered for a long time. Back to the Future worked so well because of the great story and the humor was great, the whole cast worked together and made a terrific movie that will be looked back on thirty years from now and still be considered cool.10/10"
Back to the Future,03-Jul-03,"Back to the Future is one of those rare, almost forgotten, pieces of pop culture that, surprisingly, draws little attention to itself.  Unlike such notable gimmicks as Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Jaws, and Independence Day, there aren't any low-budget leeches trying to imitate off this work and cash-in on its success. This is due to the near flawless script.  Why it didn't win an Oscar, you're guess is as good as mine.  Making a time-travel storyline as in this movie that doesn't fall into plot holes the size of Terminator's is exceptionally difficult.  I'd know.The film starts slow, and gradually accelerates as it progresses.  You could almost call it a Jerry Bruckheimer movie for kids with Spielberg's trademark nostalgia.  The characters themselves are typical stereotypes for a movie like this and none of them, not even Marty himself, gel with potential.  In some ways it's as if MAD magazine made the film in an attempt to be serious.With such an automotive obsession as this film has, one must wonder if George Lucas was involved.Overall, I have to praise this movie for its inventiveness and originality, even if it created most of our time-travel cliches.  4 out of 5 stars.  Well worth your time."
Back to the Future,23-Oct-05,"I watched this movie again for about the seventh time after a 10 year lapse or so. If there ever was magic on screen, Back to the Future has it. By the end of the film, I was only thinking, ""Wow, Hollywood was once capable of putting magic on the screen."" It really makes you wonder if the best of Hollywood is behind us.To summarize a few components of the movie: The storyline and plot are superb, even with the minor plot holes. The acting is spot on in every scene. Today's film editors should watch this film a hundred times to see what editing should really be like, nearly flawless. The direction is unbelievable in my opinion. The screen writing and script are perfect as well and will make you laugh and smile throughout the movie. Every line by the awkward McFly family, every crazy rumbling of ""Doc"", and even the cheesy bully taunts of Biff fit together so well.When I sat down to watch this movie a few days ago, I expected to see an aged movie that I remembered being much better than it actually was. I'm so glad I was wrong."
Back to the Future,08-May-15,"When I was little, my mom bought this movie on DVD for my dad. He turned it on one day and I brushed it off as ""one of those weird old movies daddy likes"". Eventually, I came out, sat down, and watched it. And the rest was history. I was so in love with this movie, that for 80's day at my school, I dressed up as Marty McFly. Nowadays, I love the movie more than ever. My favorite thing about this movie is the relationship between Doc and Marty. Most of the time, when a kid or teen hang out with an older person in movies and TV, people think they're more than friends. How many jokes have you heard involving Batman and Robin's relationship? However, Marty and Doc's relationship is pure friendship. I'm really good friends with one of my drama teachers, so I know how strong that type of friendship is. What else can I say? I love everything about this movie! If you haven't seen this movie, go see it now. Like...right now. Stop what your doing and go see it."
Back to the Future,21-Jul-14,"Synchronize your watches! If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits 88mph, you're gonna see some serious s***. Directed & written by Robert Zemeckis, this movie will forever remind me of what good-feel movie is supposed to be. The movie is about a teenager from 1985, Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) whom is sent back in time to 1955. While, he was there, he meets his future parents in high school and accidentally becomes his mother, Lorraine (Lea Thompson)'s romantic interest, causing a time-rip. Marty must repair the damage to history by trying to get his parents to fall in love, and with the help of scientist Dr. Emmett ""Doc"" Brown (Christopher Lloyd), while, also finding a way to return to 1985. I love the fish out of water history time-travel comedy, with the high-stakes action scenes. It was very entertaining. I love how the film has its running gags, and inside jokes of historical pop culture events; of Robert Zemeckis's work, and what was happening in the 1980s at the time. The movie has everything for every audience member, at the time. While, most movies were risqué and adult-aimed at the time; this movie balance it, enough to make it watchable for both family and single house-hold settlings. Parents went to go see it for nostalgia reasons. While the movie is mostly set in 1950's, it's truly a mark of the 1980's. I have to give the movie props with its controversial movie dilemma, with the Oedipal relationship with his mother. In any other movie, this might be tasteless, and turn people off, but Back to the Future made it work. I can also buy that, teenager Marty McFly would be friends with an older mad scientist, Doc Brown without it being creepy. Both have this father/son relationship that I love from this film. Mad praise to Christopher Lloyd for creating this character for his own. I can't see, anybody besides him. The production was indeed challenging. There were some changes that help the film, a lot. First off, is the title of the film, the film was almost call, 'Spaceman from Pluto'. Gladly, somebody came to their senses, and went back into the title, 'Back to the Future'. Another is that, while, Michael J. Fox was the first choice to play Marty McFly, but he was committed to the show Family Ties. So they hired Eric Stoltz. I wouldn't say, Eric Stoltz would be awful in the movie, but indeed, Michael J Fox was the best choice for the film and they wait on production, until Fox's schedule opened up. The supporting cast is well-acted. Crispin Glover that played George McFly got all George's nerdy mannerisms, right. Lea Thompson is just amazing, and beautiful actress to play Lorraine McFly. Thomas F. Wilson as the bully, Biff Tannen was just hilarious. Every scene with him, made the film, so much better. You'll love to hate him. The set use for the film is one of the most famous movie backlot, previously being used in such works as 1962's To Kill a Mocking Bird, 1960's Inherit the Wind, and others works. The movie had a pretty good pace. There weren't a lot of slow or boring moments. Maybe, the beginning, it does take them, forever to get the time travel part of the film. Eight minutes were cut, including Marty watching his mom cheat during an exam, George getting stuck in a telephone booth and Marty pretending to be Darth Vader. Thank God, they cut the 'Nuking the Fridge' idea. An early draft of the Back to the Future script saw Marty travelling through time in a fridge and being caught in a nuclear bomb detonation. Spielberg would later use this in 2008's Indiana Jones & Kingdom Skull. Zemeckis almost cut out the ""Johnny B. Goode"" sequence as he felt it did not advance the story, but the preview audience loved it, so it was kept. The visual/special effects are just ground-breaking for the time, and it's just beautiful to watch. The opening scene, flawlessly sets up the film's central themes of time and space, provides heaps of exposition. The music by Alan Silvestri is emotional, epic and intense music. It's give the feel of two friends alone, fighting alone against two of the greatest forces ever know to humanity; time and fate. About Huey Lewis and the News, ""The Power of Love"". It's a product of its time. It doesn't hurt or help the film. It's just there. I do love the 'Earth Angel' song. It's romantic as hell. There are some nitpicks that I could focus on, like the time-travel plot-holes, but trying to understand the logic of all the time travel paradoxes, would take you out of the movie, and give you a headache. It's not worth it. Still, how his parents never find out that Marty McFly look like the kid, Calvin Klein from their childhood? Other faults of the movie are, the Pepsi product placement and its over used clichés. The movie also one of those films that would audience would see anything in it, as people see symbolism from 9/11 tragedy, JFK assassination conspiracy, Aliens, and others. Others see the film, themes taken from ancient and spiritual myths such as Kronos vs Zeus, the Bible, and others. One thing, it did influence is the skateboarding culture. The movie occurred during the 1980s infancy of the skateboarding sub-culture. The film was such a success, that it create two sequels, 1989's 'Back to the Future Parts II' and 1990's 'Back to the Future Park III'. It also create an animated series, theme park ride, several video games and a forthcoming musical. As with all great movies, Back to the Future, has stood the test of time. It never gets old. Overall: Power up the DeLorean, turn the time circuits on and get the flux capacitor! Where we're going, we don't need roads."
Back to the Future,05-Sep-00,"""Back to the Future"" is a very smart film that benefits from likeable characters and an insightful screenplay.  Michael J. Fox accidently goes back to 1955 in a DeLorean that has been turned into a time machine by the wacky Christopher Lloyd.  Now Fox must bring his parents together after he inadvertently changes the future.  It is not quite as complicated as it sounds.  The film is great fun that seems brand new 15 years later.  A great movie by Robert Zemeckis.  4.5 out of 5 stars."
Back to the Future,25-Jul-14,"One of the best movies EVER! Back the The Future is movie on time traveling. Time traveling has always been exciting and fun. I've watched this and About Time which are movies about time traveling and both are awesome. BTTF is TOO Awesome. Couldn't believe this was a 1980s movie.BTTF trilogy is an incredibly awesome adventure taken by Marty McFly and Dr.Emmett Brown. Dr.Emmett Brown a crazy, funny scientist invents the time machine, the biggest dream of his life. And Marty who is his friend gets to be a part of this awesome adventure by mistake. The best thing about this movie is how it shows whatever happens is bound to happen whether you want or not. And how with change in your attitude or with some help you can completely change your whole life. ""If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything."" - Dr. Emmett Brown Back to the Future is an amazing movie. This 1985 movie is so much better in quality as compared to the movies nowadays which have a shallow impact on the audience. You will actually feel connected to the movie and glued to your seats till the end There are not many movies of 8.5-like rating which are packed with Comedy, Drama, Adventure of such level... It's a MUST WATCH for all.Hope you all enjoy it too. Cheers!"
Back to the Future,22-Apr-15,"What else needs to be said? Anyone that knows anything about filmmaking knows that this is the best film ever made. Try watching certain movies over and over and see how quickly you get sick of it. This movie is different. The depth and richness of storytelling, the characters, oh my, the characters. Doc Brown is easily one of the best and most memorable on screen characters in any film ever. Biff, Griff, Buford...best on screen bully ever! Compare this movie to other epic movies, such as Star Wars - while those types of movies are great in their own right, Back to the Future is different. There is a warmth and comfort to the way that Bob Gale and Bob Zemekis crafted this screenplay. It's pure genius. And for all of you fans that always have to mention ""plot holes"" or ""minor flaws"" - please make sure you have seen every second of the 25th Anniversary set of the trilogy that has an entire bonus disc, as well as more bonus features and two different commentaries on the main discs. Bob Gale is aware of every little detail about his script and talks about it in the commentaries. My true love of this film came as a result of watching all the behind the scenes material - which if you haven't seen, you must see it if you're a fan of this movie. It will give you a whole new level of appreciation for this film. As someone that is into filmmaking and a total nerd about directing, cameras, technical details, I can't get enough of watching and listening to these guys talk about how everything came together just right for this masterpiece to happen. I can't say enough about this film, its actors and all the people involved in making it. Truly something not to be rivaled and we will probably never see anything close to it ever again."
Back to the Future,16-Sep-01,"I feel that there is no such thing as a perfect film,but in today's cinema,""Back to the Future"" comes amazingly close.It has laughs, AND thrills,always a great combination.I am amazed at the attention paid to nearly every single detail here.For example,at the start of the film,Doc and Marty are in the parking lot of the ""Twin Pines Mall"".Then,shortly after Marty arrives in 1955,he accidently runs over one of old man Peabody's beloved pine trees.Toward the end, after Marty returns,the name of the mall changes.This is something you just don't notice until you see the film several times as I have. Excellent casting,particularly Christopher Lloyd as the unforgettable Doc Brown,the humor of the Ronald Reagan bit and the Johnny B. Goode sequence,along with the ultimate heart pounding ending and the attention to detail as I mentioned make this film as close to perfect as you will see in modern cinema.The sequels? Forget them.This is the only one of the trilogy you need to see."
Back to the Future,03-Feb-20,"This is what movie making is all about,a time travel adventure from STEVEN SPIELBERG that is truly TIMELESS.This family movie has entertained generations and will continue to do so,MARTY McFLY is a smart witted softhearted teenager who slides on the rim of reality,his best friend is an absent minded genius and but for his girlfriend he is certainly outside the populous,MARTY is about to discover the realms of possibility through the madcap ideas of a borderline nutcase,soon his friend is in grave danger and MARTY finds himself in a race against time to protect him.sci-fi adventure at its best,beautiful set pieces now and then,brilliant story with comedy and wit and and an unlikely hero in the shape of a DELOREAN all add to this out of the box brilliantly executed 80s classic....."
Back to the Future,28-Sep-14,"PlotMarty's good friend, Dr. Emmett Brown, invents a time machine in the form of a sports car and because of unforeseen circumstances Marty finds himself trapped in 1955 where he ends up meeting his parents and inadvertently fowls up how his parents come together and fall in love. This blunder endangers Marty's very existence because if his parents don't become an item he will never be born so Marty must move heaven and earth to get his parents on a road to romantic bliss. Meanwhile the younger version of Dr. Emmett Brown must find a way to get his time machine working so he can get Marty back to his own time.Character DevelopmentThe lead character Marty McFly doesn't experience much character development, but he is able to influence others dramatically. Only these developments aren't the focus of the story and mostly happen off screenActingOne of the ingredients that are equal to the magic of the story itself is the acting. The characters come to life on screen and carry over to everyday life. This has become an event film that has worked its way from pop culture to film history that has helped mark a decade. There is nothing second rate when it comes to the acting for there are no false moments in any of the cast's performances. Though there is a lot of action and racing about, much of what makes repeated viewing of this film possible are the humorous situations that Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) and Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd) keep getting themselves into and how they react to them. All the lead actors do stellar work and make the trouble that Marty and Emmett get into very believable.OverviewThere are a lot surprises that are both humorous and entertaining. Again the writing is on a level all to its own where one scene snaps perfectly with the next. There never seems to be a moment in time that doesn't connect to a later moment. It is quite brilliant and the transformation from the cast's older to younger selves is really amazing. Mix this with the energy of the soundtrack and this has got to be one of best movies of the 80s if not that of all time. Top marks all around."
Archive,11-Jul-20,"*EDIT: I just saw this a 2nd time. Knowing the ending made this an entirely different film - surprisingly in a good way. Sure the surprise wont be there, but seeing it again through a different perspective and knowing certain things, I picked up so many metaphors and clues! Thus I had to up my rating from 8/10 to 9/10. Brilliant film. See it again!
------------I'm still trying to take it all in and absorb the finale. But, wow.This is going to be one of those films that viewers either don't enjoy, or love. I was getting a little bored after the midway portion, and the slow pacing of the 109 min runtime really felt like the film was dragging its heels, but the satisfaction and reward towards the end made it all worthwhile, at least for me.Take into account that the brilliant writing and on-point directing, is the first full length feature film by Gavin Rothery, with only one prior short film for this new filmmaker. So for putting such a high caliber, wonderfully vibrant and expertly captivating feature film debut, for this first-time filmmaker, much respect and mad props to him. Rothery is certainly a filmmaker with a ton of potential and one to watch.It's not your typical sci-fi, as it had many layers, and creates an engrossing study of human frailty and obsession intertwined with AI. The cinematography was outstanding, with exceptional and gorgeously shot scenes, production-designed sets, and S/Vfx. The score was very fitting and really set the tone for the entire film. Theo James and the rest of the cast, nailed their characters.Had this film's pace been a little faster, and/or 10-15 mins shaved off from the runtime, this film would've been perfect. I'll definitely be watching this one again, but only after the stunned feeling leaves my stomach. It's a well deserved 8/10 for this film and newb filmmaker from me.

Archive,11-Jul-20,"This is one of the best science-fiction movies I have ever seen. Some maybe won't agree with this but for me it was damn near perfect. It's definitely a slow movie but it has a great story and thought-provoking ideas to consider. A man who is an engineer in artificial intelligence has his life blown apart by the death of his wife, right after he lands the job of a lifetime. It follows his work in developing artificial intelligence in the wake of his wife's death.Set in Japan, the main character is the only person who works in a facility devoted to researching and developing artificial intelligence. In the future, if a loved-one dies, a company called Archive can store that person's essence in a hard-drive like state but the remaining family only has a short time before the archive of their loved-one deteriorates completely. This company works to give people a chance to say goodbye to someone who died if they didn't get the chance to do so in life. There are fascinating implications that this brings up with life and death and what comes after. Our main character here has been working behind the back of the company he works for in order to insert his wife's essence into a new robotic body.Along the way the engineer has completed two prototypes in his efforts to perfect the technology required to be with his wife once again. The first model is very child-like and doesn't have much of a human-like body. The second has arms and legs similar to a human and displays cognitive abilities of a teenage girl about 15 years old. As the development of the body for his wife progresses, the second prototype displays jealousy and resentment towards the engineers new interest in making a body to download his wife into. This brings about new issues as the engineer progresses closer to his goal.I really enjoyed the characters of the first two prototypes and it really brings a depth to the story as a whole. The effects are great and the music score was enjoyable as well. The production was amazing all the way around. If you like science-fiction I think you will enjoy this movie. It brings up many thoughts to ponder on about existence and life. Give it a shot. I'm glad I did."
Archive,10-Jul-20,This was quite a well done movie. These days most movies you know where theyre going long before they get there. I thought I had this one pegged thru out but it kept coming up with surprises. These days they dumb down a lot of movies so everyone in the audience gets the story but that tends to let you guess the end long before you get there. Im happy to say not this one. Everytime you think its going to be this type of movie it turns into another type and that continues until the surprising ending which the film gives nothing away about until the last couple of minutes. Great acting great cinematography. Definitely worth a watch through. Enjoy
Archive,10-Jul-20,What an awesome and visually impressive movie. Ending blew my mind and never saw it coming. Highly recommend!
Archive,11-Jul-20,"I expect a lot of people will compare this to Ex Machina, and for good reasons. Excellent story, interesting character development, great acting and directing, this is definitely the kind of smart, evenly paced sci-fi I love (if you're expecting explosions, lasers and flying car chases, you're gonna have a bad time...).
While it may be using familiar tropes and the occasional cliche, this truly is a 7/10 throughout that earns its 8th star in the last 15 min. Highly recommended, especially for sci-fi fans!"
Archive,10-Jul-20,"... and thats probably partially true. Anyway if you enjoyed the seeting in Moon with Sam Rockwell and you aslo enjoy the ""emotional awakening of AI"" theme then I believe you will enjoy this one. It is very hard to express the difference from all those similar movies you have seen without spoilers so I wont go into plot any details. But it is different. The setup is very similar to ExMachina and the first half of the moive is a real slow burner. Beautiful shots and scenery but really nothing happens for a while. Then it starts to catch up in the second half. I was even emotinal for a bit for a robot, and no it wasnt the pretty female robot. All in all I recommend this movie to any sci-fi addict. Its more of an enomitional and visual ride so you should not expect any action here. What you can expect is beautiful cinematography, pretty good acting and a truly surprising twist at the end. Im not saying its flawless because it has some plot holes here and there but overall its one of the better movies of the AI awakening genre."

A very good SF movie and very well directed.Just watch it .... and after ...you will be thinking ""what the F....."""
Archive,11-Jul-20,"This film was beautifully shot & acted. The premise is quite thought provoking and really makes you question what would you want when you pass away. Theo James never disappoints and this is another phenomenal performance. It takes an amazing actor to carry a film and he does it effortlessly. I was not familiar with Stacy Martin prior to this film, but was extremely impressed by her. She takes on the challenge of playing the different forms of Jules and makes you feel for each version. She beautifully brings the human essence to J3. I love a movie that gives you that dropped mouth & OMG moment - this one does not disappoint!"
Archive,12-Jul-20,"Good hard sci-fi. The setting is supposedly 2038. Maybe a bit early. I'd say 2075.In any case it's a good science fiction story that has writing and acting flaws, but the plot is solid and carries it."
Archive,18-Jul-20,"Another run-of-the-mill A.I. movie about a secluded man obsessed with re-creating life in a metal body. Usually those films can be thought-provoking and innovative. But this one isn't. And results in a dry, meaningless plot with boring characters. It even has its own abysmal attempt at the Ex-Machina dance scene.But with that said, there is one very good touch to this movie. One that's unfortunately let down by the other 95% (that doesn't allow it to have the impact that it perhaps should have done). A nice idea, but poorly executed.Also, this movie is a perfect example of how NOT to use a score (music). More producers need to understand that it's not necessary to fill every second of a movie with an over-bearing score in the background. Because in doing so, the viewer loses the ability to notice which parts of the film something profound, sad, exciting, revealing or exciting is about to happen. The whole movie is filled with futuristic sci-fi ambience music; making every scene/segment of the movie feel exactly the same. Not helpful when the entire plot of the film is already set in one compound with very limited characters. It makes the whole viewing experience even more boring.If the producers of this film need to learn how to use the score correctly, refer to Moon (2009) and how it used Clint Mansell's masterful soundtrack."
Archive,13-Jul-20,"I watched it twice...the first time I missed so much of the symbolism and I had many questions.....until the end.
The second time I was able to focus on what it all meant and the feelings and interactions of the characters.
I don't usually watch sci-fi movies, but this is so much more...it is thought provoking.....grief, loss, humanity.
Theo James is wonderful as George and Stacy Martin shines as J3....
Congratulations to all involved."
Archive,12-Jul-20,The great writing is evident through out the movie. The locations are beautifully shot and the only thing you are left wanting at the end of the movie is to go and watch it all over again.
Archive,12-Jul-20,"I love Sci-fi, this one was a thinker as I was still thinking about it 24+ hour later and have watched it twice now. Wonderful acting from the two leads. The relationships between George (Theo James) and the two prototypes J1 &J2 make you fall into their world. What you think is happening is not, throw out the typical Sci-fi trope. Everything about this brought me back to 70-80's sci-if but with a twist. Looking for war ward to watching it a third time."
Archive,10-Jul-20,"This was fantastic. The acting was superb. The plot set up empathetic characters. I wasn't familiar with the Female lead. I would look for her again in other media. She did an excellent job portraying a robot with AI. I think this is maybe the most dynamic role I have seen Theo James play. I love the way it ended, which is unusual. A lot of movies these days fail to tie things together and give a satisfying ending, but this one made so much sense to the storyline. I can't wait to watch it again for all the little things I missed. ""Two Thumbs Up"""
Archive,16-Jul-20,"The movie looks great, solid special effects, wonderful production quality, with very competent cinematography and editing. In 2020, this should be the expectation, and as with most film and television media made in 2020, the writing is the weakest link. Unlike many infamous examples in horrific writing seen in these mediums lately, this film is at least competently written. The issue is what story it's trying to tell, and how it's told.There's a ""twist"" ending that actually works within the rules of the films universe, which shouldn't be high praise, but in 2020, it unfortunately is. The issue with the twist ending is that it undermines the entire journey the audience takes with the characters and plot. I won't ruin the twist, but it's on par with ""and then (s)he wakes up."" This writing device destroys the entire story, because none of it really mattered.Another issue with the writing is the characters, and their character progression and growth. Again, given the twist ending, almost none of the characters we get to know really mattered. But, even disregarding the twist ending, there's another issue with the characters. When a robot with almost no visual human characteristics named J2 is your most sympathetic character, you've done something wrong.Sure, it's an accomplishment they've written J2 to be the character the audience sympathizes with, and is the most invested in. The issue is, the film is Georges story, and once J2 exits the story, the audiences investment in the plots outcome drastically diminishes. Even J2 doesn't matter once the twist ending reveals itself, which only compounds the issue of the ending.Even disregarding the twist ending, there's still another issue with the writing; what is it trying to say? What subject matter does it explore, and what issues and topics is it addressing? Besides just telling an interesting story, this is usually the primary focus of science fiction. To explore social issues in a setting that amplifies the subject it's examining. This is where the writing truly fails from similar science fiction films like Her and Ex Machina, because this film doesn't seem to have much to say at all."
Archive,11-Jul-20,"Archive is a great movie with wonderful actors, special shout out to Theo James, great setting, cool old school sets, and an interesting storyline. And a gobsmacking ending."
Archive,26-Jul-20,I'm not sure why the ratings are so low. It's an excellent movie overall and worth watching. I can't say more without giving too much away but it's more of a thinking persons movie versus the usual drivel.

It moves along at a good pace, and keeps you guessing at every turn. Will he succeed or not? Will he be discovered before he can finish his project? Will guilt get the best of him? Tune in and you will not be disappointed!"

Archive,14-Jul-20,"* There is no end credit scene *Gavin Rothery in his directional debut! plus crew brought an astonishing sci-fi film. The story is about a scientist trying to build artificial intelligence to bring his wife back from the dead. The movie sets a familiar storyline around the film Ex Machina (2014) but it still stands on its own. It was so painful to watch because most scenes are heartbreaking, and depending on what you believe in the emotions will pour out. If men create something it could have feelings and this film show the consequences of building phase after phase to perfection in a different humanity perspective. The decisions of the scientist made me feel sometimes hurt even though he has a sentimental purpose, but one can't be blinded to other things. I loved the ending it was unpredictable and I was amazed by the double meaning of resolve by its point of view.The composer Steven Price brings the science fiction so beautifully while adding a sorrowful feel into his music. This is the kind of film where the music must be in awe to achieve the touch of emotions and it successfully created a lot of different feelings.The cast was great, and Theo James carries amazingly the whole film but my loyalty lies in his creations. Even if they are robotics, J1 and J2 showed so much feeling and the way they care is too much to bear."

I won't spoil it for you, it's an excellent film with a good story, albeit not original but with some nice twists and turns and certainly well told with great performances from the cast."
Archive,10-Jul-20,"Hours later I'm still thinking about this film. Gavin Rothery has created an otherworldly environment that is both ethereal and industrial at the same time (can that even be a thing but it is). The J3 sequence (when you watch you'll know what I'm talking about) is super bad-a$$ cool. It's indescribable. The cinematography is stunning and the score is gorgeous. Kudos to Theo James and Stacy Martin for their stellar performances. Without saying too much, the ending will leave you gob-smacked and in need of a rewatch."

The cinematography is stunning, the story is thought provoking, and the acting is superb. The emotional acting kept me riveted throughout. As is the case with Theo James films, you feel every emotion throughout. It's been a long time since a movie this good has effected me so deeply. Worth a watch and prepare to have your mind blown."
Archive,13-Jul-20,"Gavin Rothery begins a new career as director with a well written and visually stunning sci-fi movie.
In 2009, Rothery was a key figure behind Duncan Jones' sci-fi masterpiece ""Moon"": the moon base, Gerty the robot and all the vehicles were all designed by him.
Now, Rothery gives another proof of his visual talent with ""Archive"".
Some people said that ""Archive"" is a sort of ""Ex Machina meets Black Mirror"", but I think that's not the right comparison.
In my opinion this movie is more a spiritual sequel to ""Moon"", with the same depht in all its charactersations and the same taste for world building and atmosphere.
Yeah, maybe ""Moon"" was more innovative, but I don't care. This is a kind of sci-fi that's extremely difficoult to find today.
This movie is precious. Go watch it immediately if you like the genre"
Inception,01-Mar-19,"My 3rd time watching this movie! Yet, it still stunned my mind, kept me enjoyed its every moment and left me with many thoughts afterward.
For someone like me, who've rarely slept without dream, it's so exciting watching how Christopher Nolan had illustrated every single characteristic of dream on the big screen. As it's been done so sophisticatedly, I do believe the rumour that Nolan had spent 10 years to finish the script of Inception. In my opinion, it's been so far the greatest achievement in his brilliant writer-director career. I jumped into this conclusion after making a quick benchmark of Nolan's remarkable works:
Memento, as his first signature in the cinema history, is tremendous and has stayed the most mind-bending film I've ever seen. But overall, it doesn't reach the same level of Inception.The Prestige is highly impressive but somehow I haven't been able to find the very particular ""Nolan's spirit"" in it.The Batman Trilogy is the best superhero saga of all time and its peak The Dark Knight is no doubt a masterpiece as well. Nonetheless, every time we talk about it, Heath Ledger takes all the spotlights with his life-time-role: The (unique-and-only) Joker.Then there came Inception where Nolan truly stood out, having every single detail of his work done in the finest way. The multi-layered storyline despite its complexity, remains consistent and originally interesting. From visual aspect, everything was masterly handled: an impeccable cross-cutting allowed the movie to follow Nolan's nonlinear story-telling without being scattered; a wonderful cinematography work completed with incredibly imaginative visual-effects brought into life so many breathtaking scenes, some of them, I believe, will stay in the audience's mind for a long time (city bending in Paris, zero-gravity fight, in limbo, dreams collapsing...). In addition, Nolan had also a solid cast ensemble to help him deliver all of his messages.Later, we had Interstellar. Though I did admire its cinematography and visual-effects, the film itself is nowhere near the level of Inception.
SPOILERS AHEAD !!!!! For all who haven't watched this movie, you may stop the reading right here because the following paragraphs contain a ton of spoilers!It is set in the world where there's technology that allows people to literally share dream. There is, in this world, a new kind of corporate spy - ""extractors"" who use this technology to infiltrate the target's subconscious and extract valuable information through a shared dream world. Our hero Mr Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio), a very well-known extractor, and his partner Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) are approached by a powerful businessman - Mr Saito (Ken Watanabe) for a nearly impossible mission, something no one has ever done before : instead of steeling, he wants them to plant an idea in a person's subconscious, which is also called ""inception"". In return, Saito offers something that Cobb could never resist: a ticket to go home with his children by taking out the homicide charge against him. So Cobb and Arthur gather a team to carry out the mission: Eames (Tom Hardy) - a veteran identity forger, Yusuf - the only one chemist can make such a powerful sedative for such a complex 3-levels ""dream within a dream"", and Ariadne (Ellen Page) - a newbie but remarkably talented architect whose role is critical for the success of the mission. The target is Robert Fischer (Cillian Murphy) - son and heir of Saito's biggest competitor (Maurice Fischer, who's dying). The goal is to seed an idea into his mind which will make him abandon his father's business, and the team has to carry Saito as visitor in their mission to let him verify the result of inception. While the team go deeper and deeper into Fischer's mind, we discover gradually the dark of Cobb's past, as well as the 2 biggest why concerning our hero: Why he has became such an expert of inception and What is his desperate motivation for taking that insane mission.The movie is not only about the inception mission but more importantly, about the struggle of finding the way in the maze of life. In Cobb's case, it's the maze of dreams built by his memories with his past wife Mal (Marion Cotillard) and his regrets. So as long as he let himself consumed by the past by blaming himself for the death of his love wife, it will keep coming back and haunt his present: the deeper the team go into dream, the more dangerous his subconscious, under the form of his ghostly wife, comes out and could anytime jeopardize the mission. Indeed, if we apprehend the movie with these 2 layers of its story, the ending scene makes perfect sense. Yes! We're now talking about that famous ending which has still remained one of the most controversial movie endings in the cinema history. Did Cobb find Mr Saito in limbo, bring he back to complete the mission then come back to his children in the real world? Or they are still stuck in limbo - the infinite dream world, and the last scene was just his big dream? But all of those question only matter in the first layer of the story: the result of inception mission. When we perceive the story in its deeper layer, as a journey for Cobb to let go of his feeling of guilt for the past and re-find the meaning of his life, this ending did fulfill its job. Cobb didn't even stay to see either if the spinning top would fall because he didn't care any more, what's important to him is that he gonna be with his kids. He did finally get rid of his haunting past and be able to move on, and that matters. And after all, dream or reality, the importance is to truly live. So from this point of view, he has solved the maze of his life.
Some short lines about the cast:
Leo has done justice to our main character but he did not success to make a leap from his previous similar roles in Shutter Island and Blood Diamond.Joseph Gordon-Levitt could have been more intense, given the fact that he had the most astounding fight scene in the movie (zero-gravity sequence).There was something missing in Ken Watanabe's performance to portray the powerful man who sponsored the crazy mission. Maybe it was his English...Tom Hardy was OK but forgettable because his character didn't have any memorable moment though he had a lot of screen time.Ellen Page was really impressive, she did fully illustrate the cleverness and the keenness of the young brilliant architect. And personally, I did find a lot of charms in her acting.Cillian Murphy has also done a great job. Much more emotionally complex than just a target of the inception mission, his character Robert Fischer, at the end, was not so different than our hero Cobb. They both were struggling to find a way out of their own maze. If for Cobb, it was the painful past with his late wife; for Fischer, it was the grand shadow and the lack of recognition of his late dad.Last but not least, the one who impressed me the most was Marion. Mal was so beautiful and mysterious in a very unique haunting way, mostly with her speaking eyes! And for me, she is the most remarkable character of the movie."
Inception,22-Aug-10,"I'd like to keep my review rather to the point.Pros: 1. its theme - dream is a fascinating topic to say the least. There are a lot of unknowns in dreamworld. 2. its plot - there are several sweet twists and unpredictable turns. 3. its edgy drive - although you know what's coming next, still you feel jumpy about it when it does.4. its rapid storyline - the story moves fast from one scene to another, making the viewers feel like on a roller coaster ride. At times, it's hard to keep up, even after watching it several times. 5. its sophistication - there is a lot of information to remember and digest. This is the very thing the modern moviegoers are after, I believe. 6. its realism - okay, pun intended. The movie explains (or at least tries to) the ins and outs of what dream is about and how it functions, some of which are very familiar with and dear to us.Cons: 1. its poor character development - although the acting was convincing enough there was not enough of character development. I wonder how many people really felt connected to the main character(s) after watching the movie. Yes, the movie talks about emotional struggles but it was more of an action film than anything else, if you ask me. 2. too many distractions - I found that the movie had more characters than necessary. They may play certain roles in the plot but they seemed more of distractions than anything else. I wish the movie was more focused. 3. a bit preachy - I noticed that the characters would explain things about dreamworld and then the exact things happen later in the movie. I'm afraid, Inception overused this trick. In conclusion, its theme is fascinating but its delivery is not without room for improvement. I highly recommend you to go and read Somewhere carnal over 40 winks, if you dig this kind of flicks. Cheers!"
Inception,10-Jul-10,"What is the most resilient parasite? An Idea! Yes, Nolan has created something with his unbelievably, incredibly and god- gifted mind which will blow the minds of the audience away. The world premiere of the movie, directed by Hollywood's most inventive dreamers, was shown in London and has already got top notch reviews worldwide and has scored maximum points! Now the question arises what the movie has that it deserve all this?Dom Cobb(Di Caprio) is an extractor who is paid to invade the dreams of various business tycoons and steal their top secret ideas. Cobb robs forcefully the psyche with practiced skill, though he's increasingly haunted by the memory of his late wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard), who has a nasty habit of showing up in his subconscious and wreaking havoc on his missions. Cobb had been involved so much in his heist work that he had lost his love!But then, as fate had decided, a wealthy business man Saito( Ken Watanabe) hands over the responsibility of dissolving the empire of his business rival Robert Fischer Jr.(Cillian Murphy). But this time his job was not to steal the idea but to plant a new one: 'Inception'Then what happens is the classic heist movie tradition. To carry out the the task, Cobb's 'brainiac' specialists team up again with him, Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), his longtime organizer; Tom Hardy (Eames), a ""forger"" who can shapeshift at will; and Yusuf (Dileep Rao), a powerful sedative supplier. There is only one word to describe the cinematography, the set designs and the special effects, and that is Exceptional! You don't just watch the scenes happening, you feel them. The movie is a real thrill ride. The action scenes are well picturised and the music by Hans Zimmer is electronically haunting. Never, in the runtime of the movie, you will get a chance to move your eyes from the screen to any other object.Leonardo, who is still popularly known for Jack Dawson played by him in Titanic, should be relieved as his role as Dom Cobb will be remembered forever. His performance may or may not fetch him an Oscar but it will be his finest performance till date. The supporting cast too did an extraordinary work. Christopher Nolan, ah! what a man he is. His work is nothing less than a masterpiece and he deserves all the awards in the 'Best Director' category. If ""Inception"" is a metaphysical puzzle, it's also a metaphorical one: It's hard not to draw connections between Cobb's dream-weaving and Nolan's film making, intended to seduce us, mess with our heads and leave an ever-lasting impression.To conclude, I would just say before your life ends, do yourself a favor by experiencing this exceptionally lucid classic created by Nolan! My Rating: 10/10Thanks & Regards"
Inception,15-Jul-10,"Dom Cobb leads a highly skilled team, specializing in stealing secrets from people's minds by entering their dreams. When they are hired by a mysterious businessman, Cobb finally has a shot at redemption, but not before achieving the near impossible. Rather than stealing an idea, they must do the complete opposite: Inception. Planting the seed of an idea.Inception has a multi-layered plot, quite literally in fact. It focuses on the emotional journey of its lead character, Cobb, but at the same time thrusts the audience into multiple levels of action packed story- telling, very distinct from one another, but all finely connected. It has been described by critics as ""a film that rewards intellect"", and I can assure you that it is exactly that. Director Christopher Nolan challenges the audience to keep up, and rewards those who can with a breathtaking spectacle, one that has the capability to leave you awestruck. The best part about it is that while you may feel you need to watch it again to be able to fully absorb the experience, chances are, you will probably want to.Christopher Nolan brings his unique vision to the screen with the help of a star-studded cast, including the likes of Leonardo Dicaprio (The Departed), Joseph Gordon-Levitt (500 Days Of Summer), Ellen Page (Juno), Marion Cotillard (Public Enemies), Cillian Murphy (Batman Begins), and Michael Caine (The Dark Knight), as well some amazing photography by long time collaborator Wally Pfister. The thrilling music in the film is provided by none other than Hans Zimmer, who was also set the mood for Nolan's previous film, The Dark Knight.While it may seem simple at its outset, Inception is an extremely complex film, delving deep into the subconscious of the human mind. Technical brilliance and visual splendor have rarely blended together as beautifully. The emotional depth and explosive action complement each other perfectly, delivering a film that is at the same time both heart- wrenching and heart-pounding. It's a film that manages to engross you with its complexities, yet comes together seamlessly, and will have you at the edge of your seat, quite literally from start to finish.Inception is magnificent."
Inception,07-Apr-11,"Inception is written, produced, and directed by Christopher Nolan. The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Ken Watanabe, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Marion Cotillard, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Cillian Murphy, Dileep Rao, Tom Berenger, and Michael Caine. The musical score is by Hans Zimmer and Wally Pfister is the cinematographer. Plot finds DiCaprio playing Dom Cobb, a specialised spy for hire who steals ideas from the dreams of people. But one day he gets a different offer, one that will enable him to see his estranged children. To get his reward he must enact Inception, the planting of an idea in the mind of the selected target. But Inception is thought impossible and should Cobb and his selected team fail? The consequences are unthinkable.There has already been much written and pondered about as regards Inception in the relatively short running time of its life. One can only imagine what will be written and said about it in ten years time. For although it's arguably a bit too early to be talking about it being held in such high regards as the likes of 2001: A Space Odyssey, it's inescapable that Nolan's movie is this current generation's sci-fi classic. That Nolan has managed to make it accessible to the mainstream, and dazzled the eyes as much as the brain in the process, is close to being a piece of genius craftsmanship.Inception is a film that it's better to know nothing about before venturing into it, and then it asks, well Nolan asks, for your undivided attention. It's neither as confusing as some have painted it, nor does it have any tricks-peek behind the curtain type-up its sleeve. The truth is is that Inception has something for everyone; thematically speaking, and that's before we pore over the special effects that sees Nolan raising the bar considerably. As is the case with twisty high concept movies, interpretations are many, with the director rightly abstaining from discourse about his movie. What forms the basis is your basic life and death struggles, with the grey areas during and after given a clever cinematic make over. There's also meditations on grief that this reviewer personally found easy to get involved with; that of course wont work for everyone, but that is just one of many strands that Nolan dangles for the discerning viewer.If that all sounds a bit too serious for the man who has redefined the Super Hero genre, rest assured thrill seekers, Inception is also a loud swirly spectacle. The action is raucous, be it gun fights or zero gravity punch ups, Nolan has not lost the ability to take the viewer on an action fuelled roller-coaster ride, aided superbly by Lee Smith's editing and Pfister's perfectly broad photography While Zimmer's score blends electronic action pulse beats with saddened guitar strains (ex-Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr on 12 string) to craft one of the best scores of 2010. As I said, there's something for everyone here, making it perhaps one of the leading nominees for title of ultimate modern day blockbuster.Then there's the strong ensemble cast, led by a quite scintillating performance from DiCaprio. Following on from his cards played close to his chest turn in Shutter Island, DiCaprio has given 2010 two of its best lead performances. Here he gives real depth of emotion, the kind that makes it easy for the viewers to hang their hats on. His unfussy acting is easy to buy into, giving the character the air of believability, he is the glue that binds the whole film together. Murphy is wonderfully vulnerable, very much an axis in the narrative, while Levitt almost usurps DiCaprio with a neatly layered portrayal that carries a delightful whiff of duality about it. Special praise, too, for Ellen Page. Still in her early 20s, she exudes an intelligent sexiness that shines bright in a role that could have been boorishly played as a cipher in a lesser actress' hands. While Hardy provides brawny levity and Berenger leaves a favourable mark.The Matrix meets Heat and Mission Impossible, only it's written by Phillip K. Dick and Richard Matheson; or something like that. A cracking hybrid movie that's fit to grace any summer and sure to improve and enlighten with further viewings. 9.5/10"
Inception,13-Jul-10,"Films about dreams and the subconscious are usually not very straightforward and almost always weird. ""Inception"" is no exception to that rule, but like its cinematic predecessors who have explored the contrast between and the questions of what is real and what is illusion (i.e. ""The Matrix"" (1999), ""The Cell"" (2000), ""Abre Los Ojos"" (1997) & its American remake ""Vanilla Sky"" (2001)), you really can't look away, nor should you.""Inception"" is an excellent and breathtaking movie that may be one of the only films released so far during the Summer of 2010 that lives up to its hype. It is a nearly perfect and highly original film that holds your attention until the credits roll. The less you know about this movie going in, the more you will be entranced by seeing it.Leonardo DiCaprio plays Dom Cobb, a world class criminal who, with the help of a team of sleep experts, works his way into people's subconscious and steals what people value most: ideas directly from their minds. In his last assignment to possibly clear his name, he is assigned not to steal an idea from someone, but to plant one inside that person's mind. The difficulty comes when certain people are trained to block their ideas from being taken.That plot summary only covers the basics of this pretty complicated story, but to describe every plot detail would take away the magic of this film you must see yourself to believe. DiCaprio is good in his role, but unlike many other films he has starred in, this is perhaps his only role where his character alone does not carry the weight of the movie on his shoulders or share it equally with one other co-star. Instead, this great ensemble cast teams together to make this movie work, just as their characters collaborate to pull off such a unique heist. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, and Tom Hardy are especially good in their roles.The special effects in this film were also very good, which is amazing considering their simplicity compared to the ""Matrix"" movies. There are slow-motion shots, but no impossible kung fu fighting sequences. It's especially interesting when the film gets into the architecture of certain dreams, and impossible sequences are filmed in a way I've never seen other than in drawings.However, the special effects would mean nothing if the story wasn't good. For this reason, even something as simple as a spinning top holds your attention in a way you would never think it would when seeing it in this film. The credit here can be given to writer and director Christopher Nolan, who has not made a bad film yet. There are many twists and turns in this film, but Nolan never loses his focus in the process of telling the story. If Nolan does not get nominated for Best Director and/or Best Original Screenplay next Oscar season, there is something terribly wrong with the Academy.That being said, there was still a lot about this film I still don't get, and may require multiple viewings to better understand. However, some of the best films I've seen are confusing at first. ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (1968) is a film I've seen a couple of times, and still don't understand completely. It still has a major following, though, as I'm positive this movie will. It's an incredibly entertaining movie, but it also makes you think and continues to do so after you leave the theater."
Inception,09-Jul-10,"I saw Memento very recently, something that turned out to be a great miss.I saw it again, just to make a couple of thins straight-and i'll definitely do the same with Inception.Christopher Nolan keeps improving himself, with even more complex and multilayer script like this.And i thought Memento was hard to reach by most of the viewers, but no.Inception will keep you mesmerized and captivated by the genius, that's hidden behind it.And not just directors and screenwriters (or with other words-Nolan), but with acting and sound-and effects and editing as well.When you have a cast like this-i mean Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Lewitt, Michael Caine, or Marion Cotillard (a personal favourite), the movie just keeps going flawlessly.Most of the crew is the same the Nolan brothers worked with on TDK and earlier in Batman Begins.So the Oscar noms in those categories are a certainty for me.The only thing one could have against the movie, is the headache one could have.See, most of my friends go to the movies for brainless action, they enjoyed Iron Man 2 and The A-Team, but this movie-you have to see it at least twice, to understand it.The levels and the layers on which thing are happening are so many, that one surely'll miss something vital.This is a reason for not fitting to the mass audience, but i hope that won't happen, because Nolan is one of my favourite directors/writers, and he showed, that the brainless action flicks aren't all of it.There are still movies like Inception out there and still people like the Nolans to make those movies, so it's not all lost.And i hope this movie could show the audience that the story is still important for the experience one could receive, not the endless, constant explosions.Because this is really a one of a lifetime event.Saying that, i must say, that in a world full of remakes, reboots, sequels, prequels and God knows what, this is a unique chance to see something different and unmatched so far-a strong movie, that, surely will be Nolan's latest masterpiece! My Grade won't change-it's the same for all Nolan movies-sheer 10!"
Inception,13-Jul-10,"Inception is truly one of a kind. A concept which has long gestated in Christopher Nolan's mind, his eye for drama mixed with his large scale sensibilities ring true in Blockbuster season making Inception a true original in the sea of reboots, remakes and sequels.To try and explain Inceptions many plot twists and incredibly intelligent arcs, would be a foolish task. As Nolan himself has been reluctant to. The best way to approach the film would be with an open mind, if you are prepared to be taken on a ride of a lifetime, then trust that you 100% will. If Avatar was a seminal film in technology (although coming out as a rather poor film, in my opinion), then Inception is seminal in it's storytelling. With a 148 minute running time, you would expect a lot to take place, but what you wouldn't expect is the pace of it all. I did not think at one time in the film about how long was left. I was simply blown away by the depth in every single part of the film. If my enthusiasm for the storytelling aspect of the film has left you worried about the spectacle, then don't worry. They are, as hinted in the trailer, incredible, looking real and unbelievable simultaneously. The most pleasing thing about the action set pieces, is that they are genuinely used to illustrate the story, rather than to blow stuff up a la Michael Bay.With this complex movie in it's high concept, a stellar cast is needed. And Nolan as always, delivers with just that. This is vintage DiCaprio, perhaps only equalled in The Aviator, which is even more impressive as his role as Cobb in Inception is not a showy one, needing DiCaprio to be the constant at the centre of the film. And he pulls off Cobb's emotional contradictions sublimely. The rest of the cast members all shine in parts of the films, Cillian Murphy shows off his usually non-existent tender side, Gordon-Levitt bottles his usual charm for his confidently reserved turn as the reliable Arthur, Watanabe is devilish as the seemingly ambiguous Saito, Page shows why she's the next big female star and Tom Hardy revels in being the comic relief of the film compared to his recent turns as decidedly psychopathic characters.Overall, Nolan has indeed surpassed himself. He has created a world as expansive as his Gotham, a plot dwarfing the intricacies of Memento and one which blows The Prestige's cinematic reveal out of the water. This is truly unmissable cinema. Revel in it, we've still got to wait a whole two years before Batman 3."
Inception,12-Jul-10,"I had the privilege of seeing this movie before it came out, and, like most of DiCaprio's films, it blew me away.Inception is a well-made movie, filmed in about 6 locations all over the world. The directing was outstanding, there were only about two moments, maybe three seconds in total, where i noticed that visual effects were being used (of course defying gravity is pretty difficult). The plot was very pleasingly intricate, with a twist-and-turn, keep-you-on-the-edge-of-your-seat type feel. I noticed that this film had similarities with DiCaprios thriller Shutter Island (which i also enjoyed very much)seeing as it left you wondering what was real and what was not. It's great to see a movie with a thick and emotional plot and not just grenade-throwing action heroes who achieve greatness in the end.Inception also has a very well-composed score, which to me was the finishing touch to a perfect movie. If you're thinking about seeing Inception, definitely go! Even though i was fortunate enough to see a free show, it is worth every penny you pay. Truly unique, like nothing i've ever seen before. Christopher Nolan certainly covered new ground with this film and wasn't afraid to leave us hanging with a spectacular ending."
Inception,12-Jul-10,"Usually I try to be careful with over hyping a film, or setting the expectations too high, as film geeks all are guilty for, however for Christopher Nolan's Inception, this really is not possible.This is possibly one of the only perfect films I have ever seen. It is absolutely confident in every way, something which is extremely refreshing, even more so than Avatar. Christopher Nolan gets some slack for making great to look at but ultimately heartless affairs, which I for one do not agree with, however I do not think anyone can argue that here. The emotional aspect of this film not only ties it all together but is really the centre of this film, it is the focus. I do not want to over simplify the film, by simply calling it Kubrick doing Bond, or Gondry on a huge budget, because I am sure it will be called that but it is far more than that, it is something I do not think Kubrick could have ever made. It is pure Nolan, and pure greatness.I hate writing something which is pure fan-boy gushing, but its really difficult here. I did not find a thing I did not like about it, I am sure if maybe I saw it a second time, maybe I would find something about it I didn't like, but not the first time. The way it is cut, means that there is always action on screen, if not, then the visuals are interesting enough to keep your eyes glued.The final hour of the film, is possibly one of the most complicated action sequences put on film. You have to constantly be paying attention to remember all of the layers of what is happening. Without spoiling anything, all I have to say is that is what this film is about, that is what makes this film so great, layers. Once you have seen this you will now what I am talking about.All of the actors are fantastic too, Di Caprio is the stand out here. Yes, this is probably due to the fact he is the star and given all of the emotional weight, but he handles it perfectly, similarly to his performance in Shutter Island. Ellen Page, whom I usually hate, gives a great performance here. Tom Hardy gives a break out performance here, he is quite the bad ass.I hope audiences are ready for a film like this, a pure auteur driven film which does not sacrifice a single frame for the studio. I would hope this film will change Hollywood, as it is 100 percent the directors vision yet it is definitely a marketable film, much like District 9, yet I do not think it will. I cannot recommend this film anymore than I have, I just have to say everyone and anyone should see it. Sorry about all the gushing, it is just so hard not too.If you liked this review check out my new film blog: http://thedeletedscene.wordpress.com"
Inception,15-Jul-10,"I'm nearly at a loss for words. Just when you thought Christopher Nolan couldn't follow up to ""The Dark Knight"", he does it again, delivering another masterpiece, one with so much power and rich themes that has been lost from the box office for several years. Questioning illusions vs reality usually makes the film weird, but Nolan grips your attention like an iron claw that you just can't help watching and wondering what will happen next. That is a real powerful skill a director has. No wonder Warner Bros. put their trust in him, he is THAT good of a director, and over-hyping a Christopher Nolan film, no matter what the film is about, is always an understatement instead of an overestimate like MANY films before.Not since the eras of Stanley Kubrick, Andrei Tarkovsky and Alfred Hitchcock has there been a more brilliant director than Christopher Nolan. He is, undoubtedly, one of THE most brilliant and gifted Hollywood filmmakers in history. Filmmakers like him come but just once in a lifetime. He has the ability to seduce our eyes, ears and most importantly, mind, and then delivers what he intends to deliver in full blast. Rarely have blockbusters have the gall to deliver such amounts imagination and intelligence at the same time. And yes, it is similar to the excellent anime film ""Paprika"" in the whole ""invading dreams"" plot, but the similarities end there as Nolan brings the film to a whole different level.Visuals and intelligence rarely come together in movies at the same time, it's either all-visuals-no-smarts (""G.I. Joe"", ""Transformers"") or the exact opposite (""Doubt"", ""Invictus""). In this film the excellently directed action sequences combined with immensely groundbreaking and jaw-dropping visual effects are combined smoothly with a heavy dose of intelligence and believability.Although having an ensemble cast and financed by a Hollywood giant studio (Warner Bros), this film is a very personal film for Nolan, he wrote the film as well as directing it, and as you watch the film you get many glimpses of Nolan's perplexing, increasingly imaginative thoughts and dreams in the dialog that he writes and the plot that he sets up. Ideas have never felt more interesting and put to good use than in this film. This film is NOT for the popcorn muncher, rather it is a film for thinkers. Honestly I can't explain the plot for fear of spoiling the movie for you readers. Even the slightest hint will ruin the experience. The viewer will walk out of the cinema feeling dazed, confused and ultimately breathless. It's like a puzzle, both physically and mentally, and you have to pay attention throughout the film for the clues. However Nolan controls the spectacle of the film and is careful not to let it overwhelm the film's humanity, and this is where ""Inception"" shines. It is a very deep film that will have one thinking and asking questions for years to come. That's right, years.Once the film ends, you'll want to watch it again, for there's something new every time. This is a film that requires multiple viewing for someone to truly comprehend the film's ambiguous themes, and will be discussed by many in the future. This is an original film, no adaptation, no sequel/prequel, no remake/reboot, which is extremely refreshing having gone nearly three years of mostly unremarkable visual effects roadshows (""Avatar"" be damned).Of course, a film is not complete without the actors. Leo DiCaprio delivers an Oscar worthy performance, similar but better than his previous effort ""Shutter Island"". He shows glimpses of a flawed, grim, fragile man, who has knowledge about everything else but yet can't seem to come in grips with himself and his demons. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Ken Watanabe, Dileep Rao, Cillian Murphy, Tom Berenger, Michael Caine, Marion Cottilard, Pete Postlethwaite, Lukas Haas... Nolan really brings out the best in this unusual yet extremely talented group of supporting actors who make their roles their own.Nolan is of course, a master behind the camera, a real virtuoso when it comes to film. His direction is taut, focused, gripping, and extraordinarily fascinating. The detailed and complex original script is no surprise from Nolan, considering the fact that he turned Batman the superhero into pop-culture art two years ago (""The Dark Knight""). The action sequences are unique, exciting and fresh, something absent from the cinema which has since been interested at things popping towards the screen and stuff blowing up every two milliseconds. The visual effects are awesome and imaginative, and best of all they do not bring down the movie's quality one bit, rather it makes the movie more fascinating to watch. The cinematography is absolutely, beautifully shot, so we can see the action and emotion in all their glory. Production design is top notch, with terrific design of sets and locations. Hans Zimmer's complementing music score is simply outstanding, and knowing the man, that's really all I have to say. Together all of these elements combine to deliver a mesmerizing movie experience like no other this year.Christopher Nolan has once again outdone himself. He truly is a gifted filmmaker, arguably the most imaginative in Hollywood today. And ""Inception"" can proudly stand alongside ""Blade Runner"" and ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" as science-fiction masterpieces that push the boundaries for movie making and become a different experience altogether.There are two types of films: the crowd-pleasing blockbuster and the intelligent indie/art film. Nolan has combined two of these tropes together into one exceptionally brilliant package, pulling off that rare, now nearly-extinct Movie Magic that has since been wiped off the planet by sequelitis and reboots. Movie of Summer 2010? Movie of 2010? Heck this is possibly the first masterpiece of the decade! Nolan is a genius and I applaud him for treating his audiences as intelligent people.Missing this film and not getting the film's point is a crime.Overall value: 9/10 (Excellent)"
Inception,12-Jul-10,"What do we ask for in a summer blockbuster? What is it that incites hysteria this time every year for whatever dross the studios churn out? Epic hugeness? Blowing stuff up? Romance? Action? Heroes? What are we looking for in a blockbuster? I think it all boils down to thrills! Audiences want the thrill of a car chase, the thrill of romance, the thrill of the spectacular! If that is the case, then Inception just might be the greatest summer blockbuster of all time as it also contains something we often don't look for...brains! ""What is the most resilient parasite? An idea"" says Leonardo Di Caprio's character Cobb. Well, Inception is all about ideas. It's all right there in the title. The film central idea revolves around ""Extractors"", who are paid to extract secrets from people's subconscious minds by sneaking into their dreams, usually for the purpose of corporate espionage. However, when one client asks them to plant an idea in the mind of their corporate rival, ""Inception"" is born. The less said about this film the better. It is full of ideas and invention and for each set piece I divulge, a piece of the film's genius is weakened. This is a film that cleverly and intricately brings the audience through several planes of existence simultaneously but never allows the viewer to feel lost. Such is the power of Christopher Nolan's script which, I imagine, is likely to get overlooked due to the sheer visual magnificence of his direction. But everything that makes this film so great is in the script...in the ideas! Everything else is just spectacle. This film bears an uncanny resemblance, thematically, with DiCaprio's other instant classic this year, Shutter Island. Both films investigate in depth the tricks a traumatised mind can play on the individual. Both films are luscious to watch and both films keep the audience firmly outside the realm of reality. However, Inception is an even more layered film than Shutter Island and I believe the sci-fi genre setting will prove to be less alienating for audiences than the prison noir of Scorsese's film. There is not a single dull moment in Nolan's film. There is style, charm and intelligence in every frame of the film. Every performance is pitch-perfect with some strong support by Ellen Page and Joseph Gordon-Levitt particularly who have grown up right before our eyes into undeniable movie stars. Leonardo DiCaprio gives a typically flawless performance as the muddled, grieving man who we never quite trust to be living in the real world. The best part of Inception is the large amount of effects which were done in camera. While the film does make use of CGI, there are some pretty mind-blowing practical effects which are as simple as the camera telling beautiful lies; a rare treat these days. This is a blockbuster that ticks all the boxes; smart, sexy (femme fatale, sexy brainy girl, very beautiful men in very beautiful suits) and magical. Inception is the kind of film that reminds me why cinema will never die. Because anyone who thinks it's OK to watch this film on a laptop or iPad is a fool! This is pure cinema, and proud of it. Not to be missed on the big screen!"
Inception,17-Jul-10,"Many of us, not least those who populate the online world with movie reviews, observations and criticisms, are aware of Chris Nolan's raw talent. Memento broke onto the screen a decade ago and provided us with a spectacle in story telling so rare that it dumbfounded us. Since then, Nolan has gained huge popularity with his revival of the Batman franchise, and even more so with the stunning Dark Knight - that still has yet to relinquish its grip on modern day cinema - with the genius of The Prestige sandwiched in between.None of this, however, could have quite prepared us for the spectacle that is INCEPTION. A script that has been worked on for over a decade, Nolan's endeavours are inescapable in its pure complexity and brilliance - quite simply, one of the best film story lines audiences will have encountered in their lifetime. All this is supplemented superbly by the film's ensemble cast - DiCaprio's performance cannot easily be done justice without seeing it. With this and Shutter Island, now must be the time for his first Oscar - he has asserted his place as truly one of the best actors currently working. All reviews will confirm that Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Tom Hardy and Ellen Page back his performance up superbly with well-worked turns. Inception's action sequences play out wonderfully, being - along with the comic relief and back-stories - an integral part of the film's unravelling, whilst we remain rooted to the film's emotional stakes, which give immense purpose to the film's complex and layered narrative.Our protagonist battles with both outer and inner demons in his quest for redemption. The unique concept of entering dreams offers the opportunity not only for a unique species of heist but also a way to dig deeper and deeper into one's subconscious, and the ability to plant an idea which could define that person, or destroy them. In theaters around the world, Nolan uses his dynamic skill to plant an idea in our minds which together allows us to experience the very dream- share the film explores, one which will remain with us long after the film's emotional climax. Inception is a cinema experience so audacious, so incredible, and in the end so gratifying, that it truly is unmissable, and will remain a benchmark for many filmmakers in years to come.10/10."
Inception,20-Jul-10,"I cannot ignore facts. I cannot ignore mistakes and plot holes, bad writing, or bad marketing. I cannot ignore hype, especially when it's already on the IMDb top 250, it received praise from critics, cashed in a lot of money, and people call it stunning and unforgettable. The simple truth is that Inception does not live up to the hype. Let me start with the trailer. All the coolest things (the folding city, the collapsing cliffs, the train in the street) are totally unessential to the plot. None of that takes more than a few seconds. So why did they put them on all the posters as well? Nevermind. I'll move on to the real problems of the movie.So I heard all these people saying how complex the movie is. How I'll need to watch it twice. How the shocking ending will blow my mind. I knew exactly what that ""shocking ending"" would be half way through the film. The very last paragraph of this review deals with the ending. It's not exactly a spoiler but you can skip it if you don't want to know anything.Cobb (DiCaprio) takes on a mission to implant a thought into Fischer's (Murphy) mind. As a reward, his contractor Saito (Watanabe) will clean his record with the LAPD. Cobb is wanted for the murder of his wife and consequently he can't return to USA and see his children. Throughout the movie, this is Cobb's main inner conflict, that before he fled the country, he didn't get a chance to see the kids' faces and he wants to see them again. Michael Cain has a very small role as their grandpa and DiCaprio's father-in-law. Why doesn't Cain take the kids someplace so they could be with their father? People move all the time. Or why doesn't he send Cobb some home movies if he wants to see their faces so much? They could even have video calls and all that stuff. It's a long distance relationship but it's something. Well, apparently no one thought of that, and so the main character's main motivation for his actions makes no sense. As for acting, DiCaprio was good. But if you've seen Shutter Island, You've seen a third of Inception. Dead wife, small kids, a sense of loss, a pretty wooden house in a field, all those flashbacks Teddy had in Shutter Island it's all in Inception. Minus the funny Boston accent.The mission these mind thieves embark on is to plant an idea into a rich guy's mind. This is called inception. Hence the title, I guess. Everyone says it's impossible to do, so you know they are going to succeed in the end. Inception is essentially a heist movie, but instead of getting into a vault, Cobb's team has to get inside someone's mind – which happens to look like a vault. The supposed complexity of the movie boils down to the idea of a dream within a dream. Basically, imagine that once you are plugged inside the matrix, you plug yourself into yet another, deeper, matrix. There, I just explained the super complex plot of the movie. But in case that wasn't enough, there is Ellen page's character, Ariadne. She is the obligatory new member of the team that is introduced to represent the audience and their questions. I'm fine with that. Every movie has one of those uninitiated people. The thing is, she understands everything too quickly and becomes suddenly becomes the most competent character. Pretty convenient, if you ask me.Let me finally get to the mission. It's the worst part of the movie. Watanabe wants Murphy, who just inherited a huge corporation, to dissolve it, because it was going to become a huge monopoly. So Watanabe hires DiCaprio to plant the idea of splitting the company in Murphy's mind. And so they do that. For two and a half hours. But I don't care if he splits the big company or not. Why should I care if Murphy has a bigger company than Watanabe? The stakes of the movie aren't high, they are nonexistent. I am not given any reason to care about whether or not they succeed. I'm only given more and more action set pieces to look forward to, and a lot of cool slow motion and zero gravity fights reminiscent of The Matrix, but I'm not given any reason to care for what is happening. I liked Watanabe's character only because I like Ken Watanbe. As for Saito himself, I don't give a damn if his competitor destroys his company or not. They don't tell us what consequences it would have, they don't show us what happens with the company, they don't do anything with this initial idea. Which is strange, because the movie is all about ideas being important. Okay, so I didn't like the plot and the acting was nothing new. What about the rest? Hans Zimmer's unremarkable score works well with the scenes but it would be super boring to hear on its own. The visual effects are good but since all the coolest city-folding scenes were so short, there wasn't really that much to do. The zero gravity stuff was done well, I'll give them that. Cinematography was good, bordering on too much shaky camera.Here's the paragraph about the ending:The big ending is that you are supposed to be unsure what was a dream and what was reality. If it was real, then it's stupid because DiCaprio had dozens of ways to be with his kids without making things so incredibly complicated. The movie is supposed to make you think, but if you think about it the whole plot falls apart. If it was a dream, then it's a stupid cop out on Nolan's part. An excuse for all the things that didn't make sense. It was all a dream, so screw you, audience."
Inception,26-Jul-10,"Surrealism can appear to be ineffably bizarre, or inquisitively titillating, depending purely on the viewer's intellect. Though the realm of surrealism is highly nebulous and complex, but even a slight attempt at improvisation can sometimes go awry and open a Pandora's Box, making the task highly improbable and nigh impossible. This facet of reality may pose a handicap to the most gifted of the directors, but not to the genius of Christopher Nolan, who not only dabbles with the concept of surrealism, but also ingeniously blends it with the elements of Science Fiction in his latest wonder named Inception. Nolan created a niche for himself a decade back by unleashing a monster of a movie called Memento. He further substantiated his status by conjuring movies like Insomnia, The Prestige, Batman Begins, and The Dark Knight. His unremitting desire for innovation and uncanny craving to foray into the unexplored realms of imagination deservedly earned him an auteur tag, which gave him the carte blanche that a story-teller like Nolan desperately needs. It's highly apparent that Nolan takes every possible advantage of this liberty while filming Inception. Inception is not only dreamlike, but is a dream in itself and is superior to any other thing conceived on the silver screen. With its entwined layers, the movie for the most part serves as an unfathomable riddle and makes multiple viewing extremely essential. It incredibly does extremely well on both the humanistic as well as the technical fronts. In fact, the balance between human emotions and the elements of Science Fiction is so adequate that it's impossible to separate them. The movie is about a futuristic world where the human mind can be intercepted through dream invasion. Cobb is an expert in the art of extracting information (stealing valuable secrets) from deep within the subconscious in the dream state. His proficiency in extraction is marred by a turmoil that begins with his wife's untimely death. He is forced to live the life of a fugitive away from his children. His only chance for redemption lies with a Japanese tycoon named Saitu, who wants him to do an inception (planting information into someone's mind). In order to accomplish this unprecedented task, Cobb and his team must overcome a labyrinth of unforeseeable challenges, where even a slight miss could trap them in a perpetual limbo. Any further revelation would be remissness on my part as the plot is filled with such intricacies that even expatiation would be incapable of justifying its profundity. Leonardo Dicaprio gives a solid performance in the lead role, following his memorable performance in Shutter Island. He has brilliantly depicted the complexities and limitations of Cobb's enigmatic character highlighting his pain and mental trauma. Marion Cotillard is ravishingly scintillating as Cobb's whimsical wife, Mal. The rest of the cast has given a thorough performance with special mention of Ken Watanabe, Ellen Page and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.Inception is incredibly brilliant as a movie and is a breakthrough in contemporary cinema. Nolan's creativity and his unparalleled execution definitely make it an object of great cachet, but whether it would become Buñuel's 'Un chien andalou' or Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey' and serve as a prototype for the movies to come is for the time to decide. Irrespectively, Inception is sine qua non not only for an aficionado, but also for the average viewer, who is willing to delve deep enough to savour the delight.PS: One has to imagine it to believe it. 9/10http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/"
Inception,25-Jul-10,"The central idea of ""Inception"" is an interesting one: technology exists to enter other people's dreams in order to steal their most private secrets or to implant new ideas. With Christopher Nolan of ""Memento"" fame as writer and director, this should have been a smart, compelling movie. Unfortunately, ""Inception"" is a bloated failure.The root problem is that Nolan replaces the fascinating surrealism of dream worlds with lengthy outtakes from James Bond movies. For example, early in the film, when Cobb and Ariadne are sitting at a café in a dream world, Cobb tells Ariadne to stay calm. What's going to happen? Is the waiter going to bring her a glass full of wriggling eyeballs? Is she going to turn around and see her best friend from high school having sex with Abraham Lincoln? No. THINGS START EXPLODING. And that's the whole movie in a nutshell: gaudy special effects and endless fight scenes as a poor substitute for imaginative ideas.The matryoshka-doll plot of dreams within dreams isn't nearly as hard to follow as one might imagine. This is largely because nothing of consequence happens at higher levels once our heroes have moved on to deeper levels. The higher-level supporting actors just fight off bad guys -- and overblown special effects -- until it's time to bring back their colleagues from the depths.Nolan should sit back, watch a few of the best movies by Luis Bunuel and David Lynch, and try again with one-tenth the budget and ten times the imagination. (Okay, that's never gonna happen, but it's *my* dream.)"
Inception,19-Jul-10,"Unless you call this movie a masterpiece. Then you are.Damn 1,000 word limit. Gotta make this quick.Spoilers.The film is 2.5 hours long, yet feels like 5.2, and there are a few reasons for this. One of which is the fact that a preponderance of the first act is amateurish, conflict-free exposition, which does not bode well for repeat viewings.The ""learning about the dream world"" scene is atrocious. No conflict. Both Leo and Page's characters already knew what was being explained. The similar ""learning about the matrix"" scene in The Matrix did it right by having one character not know anything. Plus, there was conflict. Neo gets his ass kicked and fails to make the building jump. Much more entertaining.There's another problem with the whole section of bending the landscape where Leo explains the negative aspects of altering the dream world. The closest we get to seeing the dream world altered was Leo becoming Mr. Charlie, yet the most that happens then is a bunch of extras turn and look at Leo. That's it. The idea was not exploited. You literally have to go out of your way to miss that opportunity. Hell, that Mr. Charles scene is shorter than the scene that explains why altering the dream world is bad! Let's not forget this whole idea of one corporation one-upping another has absolutely no personal ramifications for anyone on screen or in the audience. It would have greatly amped up the internal conflict if Leo had to struggle with the notion that helping the guy who could help him would endanger someone else close to him, or us, or someone else. ANYTHING could have worked better than an energy contract that means less to me than my neighbor's bath mat. Come on. The totems were handled very poorly. All we need to know is their purpose. We don't need to know anything else, yet the film keeps piling on needless information.If this is a heist film, where is the threat of being caught? A van falls for an endless amount of time. Joseph Gordon-Levitt floats bodies down a hallway for half an hour, real-time. The guy from Bronson does his thing, whatever the hell that was. These are not complex tasks or events, but rather straight-forward in nature. Dragging them out for a solid chunk of the film is what creates the glacial pace and makes a long film seem even longer.Inception has no real villain. You can make a case for Cotillard, but she is an internal enemy. She never takes a ""physical"" presence and never threatens anyone except Leo. Everyone else is dealing with faceless assassins. That makes it feel distant from the rest of the action. It doesn't even have anything to do, emotionally, with Leo's goal of getting home to see his kids. None of this is tied together. Leo didn't even know what the hell was going on with Cillian and never even knew of the outcome until after the fact. He's separated from the physical manifestation of his goal for a majority of the film. I ended up not caring if the plan succeeded. If it was all somehow tied together, the audience would be able to experience that great emotional catharsis that everyone was talking about...but that didn't happen.In fact, Leo is so separated from the actual plot that you can literally put Levitt in his place and not even need the hero in the dream world at all! Hell, you can even put Page there, since all she does after designing the boring and lifeless dream worlds is hang out with the guys and tell Leo he's crazy. I really wish she had something else to do besides play the part of the fifth wheel.Leo's lack of involvement in the main action of the story creates a 'so what?' moment when the problem is solved for him, and I can think of absolutely no reason why the hero should not be the one to conquer the main conflict. Brody kills the shark in Jaws. He doesn't send Hooper and Quint out to do his dirty work while he stays behind to deal with his fear of water. It's integrated. The hero is forced into dealing with the physical, and in turn, but learn to conquer his internal fears before he can conquer his external opponent. This is Screen writing 101, Lesson 1, and Nolan got that wrong. That's why I don't believe the reports that he spent 10 years writing the script since it only took me 148 minutes to figure out exactly what was wrong with it.Not to mention the conceit that to enter someone else's dream and control it means that you would have to control your own subconscious, which they state elsewhere is impossible. Way to go, genius.Pretty much everything this film does wrong, The Matrix does right. Watch that instead.PS: The 'taking a scene from the middle and putting it at the beginning' gag reached its peak effectiveness in 2002 and has absolutely no place in modern films. It's getting as bad as that tired old 'It's all a dream' scenario. Oh, wait..."
Inception,26-Jul-10,"I have to say to make such an impressive trailer and such an uninteresting film, takes some doing.Here you have most of the elements that would make a very good film. You have great special effects, a sci-fi conundrum, beautiful visuals and good sound. Yet the most important part of the film is missing. There is no plot, character or soul to this film. It's like having a beautiful building on the outside with no paint or decoration on the inside.It's an empty shell of a film. There is no tension; you couldn't care less about any of the characters, why were they even motivated to do what they did. Helping a corporation get ""one over"" on another corporation is hardly saving the human race.When you operate in a dream environment, where you can't die or be injured really it means there is nothing to worry about, who cares what happens. All the explosions and actions sequences are just meaningless. By the way, why does Hollywood still keep filming action scene's an inch away from every characters nose? It's impossible to see what's going on, so many films are ruined by this. Watch and learn from the Matrix, take the camera backwards a couple of feet and we can actually work out what's going on.So 2 and half hours of looking at my watch waiting for the very predictable ending, is a million miles from being a good film. How anyone in their right mind can give this 10/10, it's boring and pointless. A film has stir the soul, has to grab you, you need to feel for the characters. Can anyone, honestly say, they cared about anyone on show here.By the way, here's an idea, why don't you bring the children (who haven't aged a minutes since you last saw them) to you, if you can't go to the US.I know the end scene was trying to be ambiguous, but the fact his father, who lives in Paris, is bizarrely there in the US to meet him (how did he know) and the children look identical to every dream sequence they appeared in, means there wasn't much doubt.In the end there is nothing at stake for anyone, so a pointless movie. I suspect Nolan will continue to get praise, but I can't really say I've got excited about any of his movies. They all leave me cold. They are not terrible, just there's nothing really there, no substance."
Inception,24-Aug-10,"I will try not to repeat some of what others have so brilliantly written in some reviews. I just add this in order to contradict the hype that has allowed this movie to be ranked so high in IMDb. The same has been happening with other movies, and that is a shame for IMDb, which is becoming unreliable.I want to stress the fact that the only complexity in this movie is trying to figure out how you can invest so much money in a script that continuously makes a fool of the average critic intelligent viewer! The story is not complex. It is deliberately confusing in order to conceal its stupidity. Nothing that really matters is explained in the movie.And there's so many embarrassing clichés (the recruiting of the team, the episode in Mombassa, the assault of the ice fortress, many of the action sequences)... the average viewer must be disappointed!And the dreams - which serve as the scenario to most of the movie - are populated by the utmost lack of imagination.Finally, there's the score, louder and louder, building a suspense that is never there, for everything is a dream, and we do not quite catch what there is exactly that can go wrong...Well, all in all, the movie is an insult to the average intelligent viewer and, having been directed by Christopher Nolan, an ultimate disappointment."
Inception,20-Jul-10,"This film really let me down.I didn't expect a great film but I expected something that was at least 'OK'. How wrong I was. I honestly can't understand the hype. 'Intelligent' they say?? What sort of intelligent film has to have it's protagonists explain what is happening continuously throughout the film?? Now Memento, that was a good film. And, I suppose, 'intelligent'. But by intelligent, I mean something that pushes boundaries of the viewer's understanding. I don't mean intelligent as in 1) able to do simple arithmetic, 2) develop reading and writing skills and 3) generally being one notch above a dolphin.OK, let's make a start shall we? Firstly, one of the greatest literary and cinematic arts is the use of metaphor. This film has none. One thing the film is full of is too much explanatory dialogue (not to mention pre-teen psychology - the father figure relationship in the subconscious). For example, in the first Matrix film, the viewer understands the profundity of what is being delivered through metaphor (a feature that the subsequent Matrix films sadly missed). In this film here, everything is painstakingly explained. To me, this speaks volumes.Secondly, great actors, yes. BUT ALL miscast and given appalling dialogue in an appalling script. I mean, Ellen Page was great in Juno, but here she comes out with painfully mechanical lines in the same way that Joseph Gordon-Levitt also does. In the same way that every character does. They ALL speak the same way and we are no better understanding one character by the end of the film than we were when they first appeared.Thirdly, logic. Philosophy. Call it what you want. Why was Ariadne chosen to become the architect? What does she actually DO??And Ken Watanabe. Why is he alive after dying on the third or fourth level 'down' in the subconscious after the film so adamantly stresses the dangers of dying in the 'dream'? How can he wake up on the plane?? Why, in fact, is there that scene at the start of the film where he appears old and which features the safe and the confidential papers Leonardo De Caprio finds.Why does Leonardo De Caprio constantly have to furrow his brow? Oh, yes, it's a vain attempt to look mean and manly because the poor man still has, unfortunately for him, such a baby face.Why is Cillian Murphy's character chosen to be their means of helping LDC's character get back to his kids? And isn't it convenient to have a dream sequence in a blockbuster that resembles a James Bond film snow-covered chase scene? Why does the film have to go on for two and a half hours instead of one and a half? And most importantly, if Leonardo De Caprio's character is so severely screwed up about his wife why, o why does he have to be the main character in this film? Couldn't the team work with someone more well-balanced?? Can he in fact be any use to his kids if he eventually finds them???Nonsense nonsense nonsense. Big pile of nonsensical psycho-babble. And yes, where else but America???"
Inception,05-Jun-18,"Have you ever felt like waking up from a dream to see its continuation? This idea disturbs Christopher Nolan ever since he was 16. Already in the future, as he developed this idea in his head, he was visited by another captivating feeling. And what if it were possible to study and manage the place of sleep? Now the British cinematographer is 39 years old, and the world has finally come to the opportunity to get to know what Nolan was so stunning, fast and loud all these years. ""The Beginning"" is a sci-fi thriller about the architecture of the mind. If for some reason this has not yet become a reason for the strongest intrigue, it is never too late to recreate it.Philosophy of Nolan. It is simple and at the same time terrifyingly exceptional. Making your environment think like you. To share all the events happening together. Experiencing the same difficulties. Strive to hold together for the hands to achieve the impossible. Making unusual things happen in the usual way. The topic can be continued, and its brief description will remain unchanged. Any person with whom you work, whether an actor or someone else, will always be completely imbued with the material that you yourself wrote, if this material is perceived by every person at the deepest personal level.Fans of the series ""LOST"" could have done the same thing with ""Star"" as they did with every series of the popular, now in the old days, series. Probably, for a reason, at the end of the day, a percentage of people will be drawn, what from wild ecstasy after watching will obviously lose consciousness in the most positive sense? The name of the film company Nolan ""Syncopy"" from the ancient Greek era means the medical term of fainting, loss of consciousness. I'm not talking about plot similarities with the term. And the logo of his film company, whose foundation happened in the year 99, has absolutely identical design as the ""Start"" screensaver. In the picture, the characters Paige and DiCaprio get acquainted in the same place where Nolan once met his future wife and constant working partner. And this is not all ""Easter eggs"".
From the skyscrapers of Tokyo to the snowy peaks of Calgary, from the exoticism of the Moroccan Tangier to the picturesque streets of Paris, from historic London to modern-day Los Angeles. The scale that Nolan saw from the emotional journey of his painting could not fit in a modest framework, so the shooting process affected 4 continents and 6 so different countries.To make the dreams look as real as possible, the director once again followed his eternal principle and tried to maximally abandon computer graphics. Whether it's a revolving corridor 30 meters long built in Cardington, or the busiest street in Paris, mass explosions are caused by nothing else than nitrogen under high pressure. Impressive buildings in the Canadian Calgary provided work for thousands of local residents for six months. Their efforts could not justify themselves fully due to the fact that on approaching the crew to the place of direct filming, for a long time there was not much needed snow. He ""fell out"", creating for the creators is another problem due to the fact that did not stop a very long period. Arriving in early August in Morocco, a big unexpected success for the creators was the acquaintance with the local team, with whose help Hollywood partially took off more than one blockbuster in the territory of this African country. And the street traffic of Los Angeles was cleaned by the railroad train, behind the wheel of which was everyone's favorite Jim Wilkie. The same guy who ran an eighteen wheeled wagon in the ""Dark Knight"". This is only a small part of what the ""Beginning"" shakes.DiCaprio amazes us with one of the most difficult characters of recent times, which is largely due to the care and personal affection that Leo showed to Cobb. Together with Marion Cotillard, they create a screen couple capable of enveloping the soul of any viewer. I've never seen anything like it and close. The talented Hollywood youth in the faces of Page and Gordon-Levitt demonstrate a full understanding of the color range and levels of brightness of the characters assigned to them. Tom Hardy, performing the imitator, brought to the picture a significant share of charisma. And Killian Murphy finally embodied an image that has long been very curious to him. In May 2009, Nolan offered him absolutely any role, and he chose the ""Client"". And Ken Watanabe ... As in the case with the other images, we all will long try to disassemble this character, which is a very important and charismatic question for us. Each of his actors, Nolan asked not to tell anything about the plot, even to their families.Quite symbolic is the fact of the presence in the film of the song of Edith Piaf. After all, for the image of Edith Piaf in the film ""Life in pink"" in 2007, Marion Cotillard received a statuette of Oscar for Best Actress. Hans Zimmer paid close attention to the creation of the track, not so much to the stunning visual component of the picture, but to the emotional world of the main characters. It's always evident when Hans is captured by the storyline of the picture for which he is going to work, and ""Beginning"" is no exception. Filling the rich sensory undercurrent on the screen with a wonderful musical series, Hans did not leave behind his own imagination, allowing himself to go beyond the usual framework in the hope of looking where they would lead him. From here came the guitar, played on which none other than Johnny Marr of the band ""The Smiths"".
For any of us, there is a difference in choice, when deciding whether it is worth chasing us for a happy moment or total happiness as such? Also here. Despite the speed with which you develop on the screen a completely different action - you want to keep up with it. Our feelings are awakened in the most active ways because of the resource that causes in us a similar instinct to comprehension and further awareness. This tape is a symbol of the whole structure of our everyday perception of what surrounds us in the material and immaterial world. A symbol that is itself the architect of a bridge connecting two opposite sides.Incredible and colossal, difficult-procedural result of the most outstanding artistic production in all spheres of film production. A movie that will never leave your mind, demanding from you its regular revision. The movie, which you will discover with each new show for yourself in a new way. A mad, multi-level, impressive plot production, attached to the deepest actor images. Infinitely rich semantic context and visual component. All this is a combination of the greatest cinematic experience that Nolan dragged through all these years. He would never have become a director of N1 in the modern world if he were not true, loving his family by a man. And this is the most important thing. That - with what all ""Begins"" ...A rare dream that survived so many years ...Film of the Decade."
Inception,04-Dec-10,"Christopher Nolan has done some great work.His ideas and direction singlehandedly gave new life to the beloved superhero Batman.While the film Dark Knight will always be recognized to the new dimensions it added to the classic Batman series of movies and comics, Inception was nothing more than a dull and linear plot, surrounded by and an even duller and more linear plot.The centerpiece of this movie was supposed to be its convoluted storyline which was scattered across multiple levels, in essence puzzle that forces the viewer to think through the movie and decipher the ending.The concept of ""levels"" and or ""interconnected plots"" worked very well for such great films such as the Matrix, 2001 A Space Odyssey, Logan's Run, or Total Recall. Inception not only miserably fails at this but it also lacks in other places as well.-Characters: Great actors, whom have all done great work in many movies spanning decades. However the characters in this movie came off as neutered eunuchs who lacked sense, emotion, and any sort of cohesiveness. (Sir Michael Caine and Tom Berenger's performances were appalling and the ""team"" of dreamers lacked screen dynamics and chemistry.) -Action: For a dream world, the action in this movie is very unimaginative and is well within the typical Hollywood bounds. Car cash scenes where the heroes drive and shoot, building shootouts, and melodramatic bullet wounds (as always one character is wounded critically, the team must save him; however the character can still ""fight"".) -Plot: This movie could have easily been over within 1 hour of rolling. Not only was Inception's ""puzzle ending"" blatantly obvious 40 mins into the film, but the storyline it self lacked any substance or draw. The overly complicated ""puzzle piece"" effect which Nolan was trying to achieve, was nothing more than the main story line being surrounded by excessive fluff and whimsical bullplop.*I will credit the movie with one notable mention. Nolan managed to work a Matrix style fight scene (which have been overdone by Hollywood since the early 2000s) into the small confines of an elevator.In the ending, Inception is not the great rave that many make it out to be. While the movie takes place in a ""dream world"", where bounds are limitless, the movie itself is sterile, cliché, repetitive, and unimaginative. This is even further compounded by one dimensional characters, and a drawn out storyline that pretends to be an enigma.Perhaps Christopher Nolan's true intent was to make a sterile and lack luster movie aimed strictly at making today's self-absorbed and obtuse Facebook-hipster generation feel ""smart"".Inception can be compared to a class presentation where the student is unprepared. To hide this, the student uses convoluted and circular logic to stammer through the presentation and pass the time. It is obvious that the student knows nothing and has wasted several minutes talking about a subject that could have been explained in seconds. Nonetheless, since the student used ""big words"", talked excessively, and is deemed to be in the ""mainstream"" the class gives a standing ovation regardless..."
Inception,09-Nov-10,"Look I am a fan of Chris Nolan or at least I used to be. His movies are always different and I liked them. Prestige was the first movie that I watched of him and I loved it. The Dark Knight was the movie that I had the highest expectations and it did not let me down. I know there are 10 things not to like The Dark Knight but for me there were 1000 things to like. But this time I AM disappointed. Inception is like the cutest car that can't run very fast. It has its good looking but no good plot and a million questions about the concept.There are a few simple rules about a science fiction movie or story. When you watch one there are things you feel right or not. You can use your wildest imaginations but at some point they have to make sense. This film certainly did not feel right. This was like a low budget science fiction which starts well but loses it after a while except for this was a big budget movie! Well there ARE a few things to like about this movie. It has a good concept, good graphics and good acting. If the plat was better and a few more things made more sense this could have been the masterpiece everyone thinks it to be."
Inception,18-Jul-10,"I have been reading nothing but good reviews on Inception these past few weeks, now I knew from the minute I saw the trailer, I had to see this movie but I didn't know what to expect. If you have seen the trailer to this movie, you know that it doesn't explain too much. But I saw Inception today and all I can say is: Wow! With an incredible cast and amazing director, you just can't go wrong. Inception is a movie that not only makes you think but can start a whole conversation with what you just saw on the screen. It's a very clever story that is told with skill and passion, while you do have to pay attention, I loved that it made me think. One of my friends saw a premiere and told me how he would have to see it again to understand it, but I didn't get that when I saw it today. But I would love to see the movie again, I have no problem with that. Between the performances, the story, the sounds, the editing and the incredible effects, I would love to watch this movie over and over again, it's my favorite film of the year so far.Dom Cobb is a skilled thief, the absolute best in the dangerous art of extraction, stealing valuable secrets from deep within the subconscious during the dream state, when the mind is at its most vulnerable. Cobbs rare ability has made him a coveted player in this treacherous new world of corporate espionage, but it has also made him an international fugitive and cost him everything he has ever loved. Now Cobb is being offered a chance at redemption. One last job could give him his life back but only if he can accomplish the impossible inception. He gathers a group of thieves that will pull this incredible mission off, teaching new comer, Ariadne their amazing world and how to alter it to their liking, but if gone too deep into making the dream into something strange, they could get lost and play limbo between reality and dreams. Even after all the lessons, instead of the perfect heist, Cobb and his team of specialists have to pull off the reverse: their task is not to steal an idea but to plant one.To write a dream is a riddle, I love the way this movie was written. Christopher Nolan is one of my new favorite directors, he knows exactly how to write and tell a story. The only small flaw, this is a very small complaint, is that his stories while they're incredible, can also be a bit exhausting. This film is a bit long to warn you in advance, it's a little over two and a half hours long. I felt like there were a couple of things with the story that could have been trimmed, but like I said it's such a small complaint because Inception intrigued me so much. To say that this film will be a contender for the Oscars is pretty much a guarantee with the sound, script, editing and effects. Hopefully I think it might be a runner up for best picture.One of the things I hate to do in a review is brag about a movie because I don't want others to get over hyped with the film and to be disappointed when they see it. But honestly, I don't think there isn't one person I wouldn't recommend this movie too. Inception has some of the most incredible effects mixing The Matrix and The Dark Knight, I think the ""Zero Gravity"" fight scene is one of the most amazing moments I've seen on the big screen. I loved how the story kept you thinking and going, guessing what would happen next and what was going on. A dream within a dream within a dream, you even begin to question with the characters what is a dream and what is reality. With a great cast and excellent director, Inception is everything I wanted and more, once again, Nolan created a masterpiece. Something from his own mind, Inception questions yours' and makes you wonder which world you are part of.10/10"
Inception,24-Jul-10,"easily one of the worst films ever made, that some critics fell for it, just shows how bad today's professional critics have become. no doubt all the 14 to 18 year old Nolan fan boys are going to attack all of us, that have seen through this psycho babble non sense. ultimately the worst thing about the film is that it was utterly boring, from start to finish. at no time to you feel anything for any characters, the dialogue is of such a juvenile nature he must have got a 14 year old to write it. the guy has no idea of what dreams are what takes place during them, i will not go into any philosophical or psychological discussion here as the film does not warrant them, giving there is no sense in anything that is said or done. like dark knight this will have its time in the sun and in a few years the very same people who raved about it will wonder why. as for the ending with the top still spinning telling the audience that anyway it was all still a dream, totally makes the whole exercise futile. shame that a once good film maker has gone right up his proverbial"
Midsommar,31-May-20,"Let me first say, this is not a ""bad"" movie. It utilizes creative camera work and cinematography to add to the narrative. But I personally still didn't like it. Its main goal in my opinion is to disturb the viewer as much as possible through the use of sound, gory visuals and the feeling of isolation and insanity. While I can see how this can speak to a certain audience, it didn't appeal to me and made me want to turn of the movie quite a few times. If you are into these kinds of films, definitely give this a try but if you, like me, enjoy being scared by a horror movie instead of weirded out and disturbed, this might not be for you."
Midsommar,04-Jul-19,"I'll start this off with a warning. If you're a mainstream horror fan, you will not like this. It is not The Conjuring, it does not have jump scares, it is a slow movie. It's not scary in the way that most horror films are scary. It doesn't frighten you. It felt traumatic. This is an artsy movie for sure. If you don't like that, don't see it.Florence Pugh is absolutely phenomenal. She provides the heart for the film and is what keeps the audience emotionally invensted in such a disturbing film. It's one of the greatest horror performances that I have ever seen.The cinematography is stunningly gorgeous. I've never seen a film look so gory and grotesque and yet absolutely beatiful at the same time. It's some of the best cinematography that I've seen in years. The art direction is also phenomenal in providing us with a floral, candy colored, nightmare world.And Ari Aster's screenplay and direction is what makes this so special and separates it from other horror pieces. It's slow, methodical, eerie. But the characters are psychological and deep. The dialogue is real and colorful. The plot is surreal and disturbing. He let's the scares crawl at you as opposed to jump at you. He allows you to see what will happen, process it, feel the shock of what's about to happen, and then still shock you even more when it happens.This film will be divisive. I have no doubt that many people here will hate this. However, while this is a challenging film, it's also a great film. Halfway through a character says something along the lines of ""That was so messed up, but I'm trying to keep an open mind."" I suggest that audiences take this advice.PSA, this movie is extremely violent, bloody, and gory. It's pretty horrifying and it could have stuff that is triggering."
Midsommar,21-Jun-20,"I'm sure I'm missing some higher and deeper meaning to this...
But I just found it to be boring and pointless."
Midsommar,17-Jun-20,"As I was watching this I commented several times on the cinematography itself. But even so, I was starved for some sort of narrative. Not to mention, the pacing of the film is so agonizingly slow, I could have walked out of the room at any time and returned to see there had been no progression in the story itself. The characters are all unlikeable, and two dimensional. The protagonist's trauma from the beginning of the film is never addressed again and doesn't contribute anything at all to what little story there was. The film was basically a perfect example of things happening slowly with no climax or resolution but they get away with it because the director decides to put in trippy elements that make no sense to fake the audience out with a false ""deeper meaning"". It's lazy writing, and so much of the violence and nudity was a cheap shot to keep the audience uncomfortable but it was so overused, and abused that they can hardly take these ""unsettling"" elements seriously."
Midsommar,06-Jul-19,"I'm not sure how but the movie had me on edge the entire time. You have to enjoy cinematography to really enjoy this. I left the movie like I just came down from a high. The whole thing felt like a bad trip afterwards, I was pleased and not at the same time but I think that's how we're meant to feel. It's a good change from super hero movies and terribly made horror movies."
Midsommar,27-Jul-19,"This film can't be saved even by the undeniable cinematography. It's unbearably slow, the violence is gratuitous, and it epically fails to be a horror movie on any level. Midsommar tries to be psychologically terrifying/disturbing, but misses the mark because the characters are hollow, and flat.The theater burst into loud laughter at several points because the film becomes so absurd. You stop caring entirely about who dies or how they die, will they live..."
Midsommar,02-Sep-19,"Not sure what this is supposed to be. Its definitely not a horror movie. Its not even that scary, has a few unsettling moments but thats it. Its just weird and doesnt really have any dramatic arc or raising the tension. Basically the whole movie is a few strangers saying WTF? constantly and everyone else telling them "" 'ts ok ! guys""
Also besides that, its revolves around a traumatized, annoying and totally without self respect girl that slowly starts benefiting from this weird place. Because of course, we cannot have a film these days without it being a ""personal journey"" of some sorts. Writers trying to be smart and ""deep"".
Yeah nothing beats a bizzare and crazy rituals to make you sane.If youre expecting horror and monsters or supernatural, keep going. Its just a weird film with no real ending, resolution, interesting character or events. Albeit with nice filmography and quite good actors it has no real dramatic structure or captivating story."
Midsommar,03-Jul-19,"I suspect that reviewers who believe this movie to be the weirdest, most deranged and tripped-out film they've ever seen have not watched many movies. I recommend you watch ""The Wicker Man"" from 1973, Alejandro Jodorowsky's ""The Holy Mountain"" and Sergei Parajanov's ""The Color of Pomegranates"" before you watch this watered down, pretentious murk in order to get a sense of how movies can truly be mind-altering.
The ""story"" is essentially every cliché of the slasher genre mashed together: a group of young people naively go into the wilderness (Sweden, very scary place lol) and encounter messed up stuff. They each die one by one and, SPOILER ALERT, there is a ""final girl"" who survives in the end. The rest of this cliché story is fluff. If you think, based on the trailer, that much of this film will mirror the original Wicker Man, you are exactly right. There is even a big fire at the end where a guy gets burned alive.
There is a fine line between homage and rip-off and this may a great example of a film that slips over the edge into complete rip-off territory. I won't even go into all the logical loopholes in the story and the scenario, or point out that none of the customs line up at all with ancient Scandinavian rituals (thus making one wonder why this even takes place in Sweden to begin with, like, why couldn't this be a cult in upstate NY?) because there's no point. The script doesn't even attempt to be deep, the research here is sub-Wikepedia level, and the characters are cookie-cutter types you've seen before in a million other horror movies. One logical question I would ask, however, is how come all of these people are anthropology PhD students going to research Scandinavian paganism but none of them speak Swedish??!?!? Has the writer ever even talked to someone with a PhD???
All this said, Florence Pugh is a talented actress and does a great job with the shallow script. She transcends the material and shows that she can be a powerful dramatic actress. The cinematography is gorgeous too. The editing and sound are pitch perfect. I was especially taken by the set design, the use of furniture and quirky wall paintings to give the film a sense of intricate beauty to contrast with the horror. This is all really fabulous and the people who worked on these aspects of the film should be commended. It is all cosmetic, however. Without the mask of beautiful production and a gifted actress, the director/ writer Aster has absolutely nothing going on here.
""Hereditary"" was a very good, solid horror film and I wonder if Aster didn't rush into this sophomore effort too soon. This seems like a script he could have banged out in a night, especially since it feels like something made out of other films. It also seems that Aster repeats some of the same tricks from ""Hereditary""- using shocking, Gaspar Noé-like violence and relying on making his audience feel uncomfortable at the sight of incongruously naked people running around. These stock images are going to get old really fast for him, he needs to work on building up to scares that really pay off.
There will be people who love this director, who are swept away by the cool style and photography of this film or who have simply never seen any of the hundreds of other movies out there with strange imagery and creepy paganism, and these people are going to think this movie is a mind-blower. That's nice, but please watch ""The Wicker Man"" from 1973 first before you fall in love with this dumpster fire."
Midsommar,16-Jul-19,"I originally review this as a 5 but changed my rating to 2. Because yes, this movie stuck with me, but not in a good way. I kept wanting more, wanting answers, but it failed to produce. I think I get what the movie was trying to be, but it took such a slow and choppy path to get there. It's a drama splattered ( pun intended) with moments of shocking gore and some misplaced humor. And to think this was a shortened version? I got tired of watching people eat, stare, wait to sit, drink, dance.I think the way Danny was ""trapped"" into flowered dress at the end WAS symbolic f how the audience was TRAPPED into this suffocating boring film.Don't waste your time!"
Midsommar,10-Jul-19,The only thing scary about this movie is the 2.5 hours of slow torture I sat through
Midsommar,27-Aug-19,"The only thing mysterious about this film, is how the director gets away with it...."
Midsommar,04-Jul-19,"I rarely write reviews here. But this movie was SO bad...The opening sequence was very effective. But the next two hours were unbelievably awful, filled with empty cult drivel and scenes that had no connection. It was as if the director had some great ideas for visuals and thought he could put them all together, hoping it made sense. Well, it doesn't. One of the rare movies where I've wanted to yell at the screen, ""This is so stupid!"""
Midsommar,14-Oct-19,"2.3 hours of my life I will never get back. One of the stupidest, longest movies with no point. Seriously, I am so upset I had to write a review on how a movie can waste so much of my time. I watched it because initially it had a high review and I trusted IMDB reviews to be somewhat accurate. Seems like this site much be tainted with fake reviews. This movie just plain sucks, don't waste your precious time."
Midsommar,11-Jul-19,"Save for the beautiful scenery, costuming and cinematography, this movie was a head trip! I went into it knowing it was weird but WTF!? It would call it horror but a creepy thriller. It was a bit cliche, boring and slow at times. *SPOILERS* It comes to a slow burn, literally. I suspected human sacrifice, but why include it? And the cult was just a bunch of emotional wack jobs who enjoyed getting high. This movie is deep emotionally,but also funny at inappropriate times. Like at the end, Dani's humongous flower ""dress"" hardly allows her to move.So in summary, if you want a head tripping, nonsensical way to spend over 2 hrs, then this movie is for you. If you dislike movies with an ambiguous ending, some gore and millenial age drama, then avoid it. wished I did"
Midsommar,05-Jul-19,I'm struggling to understand why people are giving this good reviews. The movie is so slow and there's not a single horrifying moment in the film. No suspense at all. An absolute drag filled with some of the weirdest scenes you'll ever see. Weird to a level where I couldn't stop laughing while I was watching it.
Midsommar,11-Jul-19,Quite possibly the most boring film I have watched in a long time.You know it's bad when the audience start laughing at a 'serious' scene.Over hyped like most boring movies. Watch something else. Anything!
Midsommar,19-Jul-19,"Who has Ari Aster got dirt on to keep getting money to make films? This is such an obvious Wicker Man RIP that it's not even subtle. The problem is that it has none of the menace, pacing, plot or performances contained in aforementioned classic. Not to mention some of the worst gore effects this side of a troma film and some unintentionally hysterical moments that I'm sure dear Ari mistook for terror. I've seen scarier episodes of Sooty as a kid. Please stay away, he'll only make more otherwise."
Midsommar,22-Jul-19,"This film is an insult to the horror genre! Just a lot of slow build up to nothing. If you like weird Swedish people chanting to sex and crying, this is your movie!"
Midsommar,20-Oct-19,"I love horror. I love disturbing. I love indie film.This was all of those things, and not really anything more. It was disturbing and gross without any point, it did not need to be over 2 hours, it did not need the mating ritual to take 15 min, it did not need to have dead bodies all over the place, it did not need to show the smashing of the head with a sledgehammer or the smattering of blood after the apparent suicide. The same effect would have been created by the suicide itself, alluding to the fact the the mating was happening, implying the bodies were around(the foot was a nice touch, up out of the garden). That would have added to the horror, the mystery and the feel.I understand the appeal, a light colored movie with a dark theme, a time when light is most apparent leading to the most dark, the fact Americans impose their own values everywhere they go, without seeking to really understand and they therefore miss out. Its a good start, a good idea, with absolutely no follow through.I left feeling angry, disgusted and disappointed in a movie I had looked forward to for some time.So many good movies out there, spend your time on something else."
Midsommar,30-Sep-19,"Its one of the highest ranking horror movies, where you literally laugh the whole time. Really, horror movie?
I watched like 10 minutes of the movie and already could imagine the end which was the same as i predicted. Big waste of time.Some honorable mentions:
1. Classic damaged bipolar, depressed, addicted to pills millennial girl and her ""bad"" boyfriend story (guy was literally supporting her the whole time because of her tragic family story, despite wanting to break up with her before that tragedy even happened).
Girl can chose to kill her boyfriend (4 years relationship) and a guy that took them all to that pagan village and is responsible for all the deaths of her/his friends. Girl still kills her boyfriend.... IQ 40...2. ""Friends"" gather and take a trip to Sweden, and after 24 hours some of them start to go missing? Sure, my friend is missing and he is probably somewhere in the woods getting massacred. Welp not my problem.
Why they didn't try to organise and save themselves or at least take one of those  lunatics with them?
Noo, its easier to get killed by 60 years old Swedish grandpa ninja that can teleport behind you.
They must be great friends if their friendship lasts whole 24 hours in danger."
Midsommar,13-Aug-19,"Maybe if you are in to mysticism, ocultism. Just maybe. As a Swede i am struggling with a disappointingly non authentic setting, a story i dont know if to take seriously or disregard as uninteresting and, in parts, poor casting.
I doesnt hold. It wont stay."
Midsommar,01-Jun-20,"All of these best friends seem to hate each other.
There is no interaction between any one."
Midsommar,13-Jul-19,"All of the people who enjoy the film praise it for the cinematography, which was uninspired, for it's breaching of multiple genres, which was done but rather poorly, and for being about the breakup, not just the horror, which, it was, but had a ridiculous stance on the break up.The positives in the film were the acting and the FX department. I wish I could give credit to the production designer but putting the tune for sacrifice on the sacrificial character's costume isn't clever, it's tacky. It's like having a name tag saying ""Hi, my name is Murderer"" in a slasher film. The lighting decision to have a horror film be in broad daylight is neither original (Wicker Man) nor well done (it is very straightforward camera angles other than a singular upside down windshield shot).The breaching of multiple genres is a good thing and could be praised, if it was done in a way that complimented the strengths of the genres involved and conveyed the message. Neither of these happened. Instead, random lines of humor were included interspersed between gratuitously graphic on screen killings. Then there were completley purposeless orgy sequences with explicit nudity that I have read were included as comic relief according to the director. How is disgusting nudity of about 15 elderly women for a full minute on screen funny? Are you trying to shock us into laughter because we have no other way to respond to something so depraved? And if it wasn't meant for comedy (even though Aster publicly said it was) then what could have been the purpose when the same plot point could have been covered by them being clothed onlookers? The perversion and level of gratuitous filth in this movie were terrible, but the fact that they didn't even progress the story or theme was what was the most disturbing part. It wasn't even for something valuable to the production.Lastly, this whole 'its really a break up movie' gimmick could have been okay, if you weren't asking us to side with the girl who murdered her partner of 3 and a half years instead of a cult member who has killed all of her friends. And what was the boyfriend's crime? Wanting out of a relationship that was toxic, but waiting to break up because the girls entire family just died? I get that he is a jerk about the thesis thing, but in terms of the relationship, he was beyond supportive. She was the one who cheated with the swedish friend first and who accused him of forgetting her birthday, which, he actually didn't do. So what exactly is Aster wanting us to enjoy about his take on the break up where the 'heroine' murdered the one person who didn't think he should break up with her right after she lost three family members?Beyond all of that, the movie was underwhelming in terms of scares or terror. It was neither a thriller nor a collection of jump scares or chase scenes. Now those have been done to death (pun intended) by the horror genre, but what was scary in this movie? The people killing themselves of their own volition? The off screen disappearances?I was disgusted by the depravity of this film and entirely disappointed in it's lack of any statement about the views or choices of the characters or situation. It was a movie with plot points and then it ended. That was as deep as this film got."
Midsommar,25-Jun-20,"This movie was supposed to be about people's feel and need of belonging. An important subject. And how did they deliver it? Two and a half hours of way too long scenes, unnecesseraly gorey violence, and clumsily put together scenes. Violence was not suspenseful, just desgusting. So much, that after a few scenes like that I was more laughing at the whole absurdity of it, than being depressed or scared. Its not a horrible movie, the cinematography and costume design can really be a candy to the eye sometimes. But if you are interested in the meaning of the movie, or you like the kind of suspense it wants to deliver, you can find movies way better."
Midsommar,10-Jul-19,"""I have always felt held. By a family... a real family. Do you feel held?""One of the most universal and innately human desires is a sense of belonging. The human brain is not meant to be alone; we are evolved to be a part of something. Belonging fundamentally allows us to form our own sense of identity, establish social connections through community, and provides us with love, attention, security, and purpose. Perhaps more importantly, a lack of belonging is when we begin to lose sense of ourselves and who we are. This loss of touch with who we are when the world around us suddenly disappears... this slight loss of footing, dip in reality, always feeling somewhat displaced and perpetually unsettled... this encapsulates the mood of Ari Aster's Midsommar.Aster has delivered a psychedelic genre-defying horror fable that wins its audience by creeping into our darkest corners of angst, longing, and loneliness. At its core, the film is about a young woman who copes with crippling anxiety rooted in a desperate and fearful need for love as she comes to terms with the end of a relationship. It's about anxiety, fear of abandonment, and moving on. It is a meditation on human belonging; an operatic catharsis played on the strings of emotional dependency; a journey both inward and outward, to finally let go of something that was never meant to be.Midsommar is not a mystery or suspense movie. It unveils itself unapologetically, as if the filmmaker has no intention of hiding anything from us in the first place (the entire movie is visually depicted almost constantly in the background on walls or tapestries). Yet the film establishes its own rhythm and pacing. As the characters embark on a mushroom trip and grow weightless and spacey, so do we get entranced by the beautiful Swedish settings and sounds-at times indistinguishable from flutes being played by characters on-screen, and at other times, woven with a spell-binding aural hypnosis (listen to ""Attestupan"" without falling into a meditative trip).Like Hereditary before it, the casting is exceptional. Florence Pugh portrays and embodies isolation and anxiety so effectively that the ideas feel nearly concrete. Her part as Dani demands an incredible range and her commitment to the role is apparent. Her character has an air of desperation to her. A perfect casting for a lonely soul. Jack Reynor, a critical piece to this opera as the unlikeable and detached boyfriend, also delivers in a solid performance that leaves us conflicted, or at the very least, challenged.If Satan and Cannibal Corpse got together to shoot Blue Valentine in Sweden, I'd imagine it would be something like Midsommar. Aster taps into a dark and vulnerable place-he opens the door to chests you may have locked away and have had no intention of coming back to. If you've gone through a break-up recently, it may resonate even stronger. It's uncomfortable, unpleasant, but ultimately, cathartic.The director goes on to describe the film as almost a perverse wish-fulfillment fantasy. You see what you want to see. The inclusion of this overarching idea bears a universal relevance to how we can behave in the midst of the most toxic relationships. Entering the ethereal fog of Hårga perhaps a metaphor for willfully indulging in our clouded judgment to escape our fears.If Hereditary was a thematic exploration of inescapable fate, Midsommar is a tighter, more centered thematic reflection on emotional dependence. The thought given to the characters and script and the details within the various shots, symbols, and sounds will all surely leave many viewers coming back for more.Plan to watch it twice, if for nothing else, to drink the tea again."
The Dark Knight,12-Feb-20,"Confidently directed, dark, brooding, and packed with impressive action sequences and a complex story, The Dark Knight includes a career-defining turn from Heath Ledger as well as other Oscar worthy performances, TDK remains not only the best Batman movie, but comic book movie ever created."
The Dark Knight,20-Jul-08,"I got to see The Dark Knight on Wednesday night, the reason though why I'm writing this movie comment this late is because I didn't wanna just jump and say this movie was awesome, I wanted to think it through, still today, I can't stop thinking about this movie! The Dark Knight lives up to it's hype and goes beyond it, this is the Batman movie that goes where no other Batman movie has gone before. It gave us a real sold story, we are finally told why the villains are the way they are, how all the injustice in the world can get underneath Batman's skin, how you have to believe that people still have faith in good on Earth. Heath Ledger, I absolutely loved Jack Nicolson's performance in the 1989 film, when I first read that Heath was signed onto The Dark Knight, I was like ""What are they, kidding?"", once you see The Dark Knight... Heath was incredible! I'm not going to compare Jack and Heath's performance, because they were two different versions of the Joker, but Heath's Joker was definitely the more scary and intense of the two nominations. You didn't know what he was going to do next, he was so crazy, he was also so charismatic to the point where you could relate to his character, and the worst part is not only that he's crazy, he's driving Gotham crazy and treating everyone like little puppets on strings that he can control, and guess what, he is doing it so well with a smile on his face. This was so much more than a Batman film, this was so much more than a comic book film, The Dark Knight truly delivers with drama, action, romance, horror, dark humor, the study of a psychopathic killer, a detective story. The force behind this epic movie is Christopher Nolan, who's previous film, Batman Begins, didn't really thrill me, but his incredible film making is truly shown in The Dark Knight, the shots that he got of Gotham City were absolutely fantastic and made you feel part of the city, part of the Batman story. One of the things that I absolutely loved about The Dark Knight is that normally with a comic book movie, you know it's not real, people don't dress up in costumes, and save the day, villains don't name themselves crazy names and dress in make up or crazy costumes, but The Dark Knight actually makes it seem incredibly real, like it could happen.Bruce Wayne is still learning how to be in his double life of Batman and himself, he has lost Rachel to the new district attorney, Harvey Dent, he's inspiring others who are dressing up as Batman and are trying to take on the villains of the city themselves. But things are much worse when the Joker waltzes into town, and he's going to bring Hell upon Gotham City. Constantly playing with Gotham's mind and trying to get Batman to reveal himself, Batman has never dealt with such a psychopathic genius before. The Joker has named himself as the ""Classy Villain that Gotham needs"", he also has brought a new thought into Batman's head of them actually being more alike than different, that Batman completes him, the Joker would be nothing without him. But Batman is relying on Harvey Dent, who is Gotham's ""White Knight"" trying to put all of Gotham's scum in jail. But when the Joker plays Batman and Commissioner Gordon, Harvey and Rachel find themselves in very horrific position and Harvey must discover if he will die a hero or live long enough to become a villain.All the performances are dead on in this movie, now everyone's going crazy over Heath Ledger's performance, but one performance I would also love to credit is Aaron Eckhart who plays Harvey Dent/Two Face, his performance was just as great as Heath's and made Two Face a human villain. You could understand his hatred and vengeance on what happened to him and why he became Two Face. I know that everyone is saying this but I truly mean when I say this is one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time. We had some great movies these past few years, but I think The Dark Knight is seriously something special, but I don't wanna build it up too much since some people go to the theater expecting my words to be the same as your own. In my opinion though this is not a great movie, I can't come up with a word describe how incredibly powerful this movie was, to be honest I would go above a 10 rating if I could; this is the Batman film that we have been waiting for. I've seen it twice in one weekend, I'm going to see it three times this upcoming week, I don't mind one bit. I can't wait for the sequel and I would just like to say RIP to Heath, wish he could have seen his breath taking performance as The Joker.10/10"
The Dark Knight,09-Jul-08,"We've been subjected to enormous amounts of hype and marketing for the Dark Knight. We've seen Joker scavenger hunts and one of the largest viral campaigns in advertising history and it culminates with the actual release of the movie.Everything that's been said is pretty much spot on. This is the first time I can remember where a summer blockbuster film far surpasses the hype.For as much action as there is in this movie, it's the acting that makes it a great piece of work. Between all the punches, explosions and stunt-work is some great dialog work. All the actors have their moments.Bale's Batman is the definitive Batman because we see everything in this character finally on film. Martial arts skills, cunning, great tactical thinking, forensic application, technological genius to advance or improve Luscious Fox's inventions/technological breakthroughs, intimidating personality, and even a little swashbuckling. As for Heath, yes he gets credit for his performance as the Joker. But you have to also recognize Jonathan and Chris Nolan for the writing and treatment of the character. It's not just the fact that Ledger makes the Joker so menacing, but the Nolans have given the character this great manifesto that drives its actions. The Joker's stance on chaos, order, anarchy, the morality of the average modern human being make the character so interesting psychologically. The Nolans drafted a complex character and only a perfect performance could've pulled something like this off. That's how difficult of a role this was, and that's why Ledger's performance is so great.This isn't an action movie. It's a film that explores literary themes of the hero and villain, as well as order and anarchy. Yes, listen to the dialog because it's all in there."
The Dark Knight,12-Oct-18,"First I'd controversially like to point out that this movie wouldn't have gotten as much hype as it did if it wasn't for Heath Ledger's death before the release and the Academy not being afraid to give an Oscar to a corpse.Nevertheless, his performance is easily the best one in the superhero genre and the crafty, well put together New York accent confirms he put a lot of dedication and effort into his methodical role and deserved what he got (an Oscar). This isn't just another Batman movie anymore. Yes, there is action, explosions and stunt work but between that is masterfully crafted dialogue that dwells deep.Batman is his definitive self now, we finally see the fullest of his character and Christian Bale does him justice. Christopher Nolan praised be created complex characters and given each one justifiable treatment. That's the reason the cast works, everyone holds their own, there are no lazily written or neglected characters.With beautiful cinematography and presentation of Gotham, the visuals and the endeavours cast The Dark Knight is a film that easily gets on top of every superhero list and is certainly one to remember... remember for a long time.Final Grade: 9/10"
The Dark Knight,20-Jul-08,"I couldn't believe ""The Dark knight"" could live up to the hype. That's perhaps the biggest surprise. The secret, I believe, is a stunning, mature, intelligent script. That makes it the best superhero movie ever made. As if that wasn't enough, Heath Ledger. He, the newest of the tragic modern icons present us with a preview of something we'll never see. A fearless, extraordinary actor capable to fill up with humanity even the most grotesque of villains. His performance is a master class. Fortunately, Christian Bale's Batman is almost a supporting character. Bale is good but there is something around his mouth that stops him from being great. ""The Dark Knight"" is visually stunning, powerful and moving. What else could anyone want."
The Dark Knight,07-Oct-19,"It is just what you want for the best movie. Great story great acting, thrilling twist.
Just watched Joker in 2019, I just has to come back and give dark knight a 10. And thanks to Heath Ledger for the exceptional performs."
The Dark Knight,11-Jan-12,"Im just gonna start off by saying I LOVE this movie.Its one of my favorites of all time. I honestly cant think of too much wrong with this movie other than its a little long and Batmans by now infamous voice. But everything else is top notch. The acting,story,atmosphere,and actions scenes are all amazing. If you haven't seen this movie see it right now! I went into this not expecting to much but I came out blown away, I cant imagine any movie being much better. I'll just have to wait for The Dark Knight Rises to release to see if anything can be better. Until then, this stands as the best movie I've ever seen"
The Dark Knight,15-Jan-12,"I saw the dark knight about three years ago when I was in the 8th grade. And I was blown away at how beautifully done it was, the camera work, the acting, the story, it all took me by surprise. It is to this day one of the best movies I have ever seen or will see. No other movie can impact you in such an intense way than The Dark Knight. It is a movie worth seeing due to the fact that the workers put so much time and effort into this one film and they did not want to waste money putting up garbage. So Christopher Nolan, thank you for not wasting our time, instead earning our time with this film. To this day I still am anxious to see the movie at home. I recommend it to anyone who likes action movies in general. To anyone who doesn't, don't waste your time write bad reviews about this film."
The Dark Knight,24-Jul-08,"Dark, yes, complex, ambitious. Christopher Nolan and his co-writer Jonathan Nolan deserve a standing ovation. I don't usually go for loud movies filled with mindless gore and violence. ""The Dark Knight"" is certainly loud and violent but it's not mindless. It has depth and soul. Even the Joker, in an extraordinary creation by Heath Ledger, is deeply human. The natural petulance of Christian Bale makes his ego and alter ego the most fascinating and complex of all film superheroes. Part of the genius of this movie is that Batman himself, in screen time, is not really the lead. My attention was captivated by Heath Ledger and he determines and inspires the breathtaking atmosphere that envelopes Gotham as well as us. The aplomb of Christopher Nolan as a director is mind blowing and his secret, I believe, is his obvious respect for his audience. What he's done is to elevate a popular genre into Shakesperean proportions. Bravo!"
The Dark Knight,20-Feb-20,"A brilliant tense movie from the beginning to the end in which tells the story of the rising new menace in Gotham city known only as the Joker and how the Dark Knight has to reach his limits trying to control the havoc he breaks in Gotham city.The movie is an extraordinary piece of the filmmaking art in all its aspects, the plot is carefully and smartly written as a intricately wrought canvas, the character development is very satisfying, the movie was shot well and nicely directed, the epic score fits the scenes and add up to the whole visual experience, the acting was intense by all cast where each fit their role perfectly, specially Heath Ledger who managed after all these years of having the Joker around in comic books, animations, TV series and even movies to literally bring this complicated character with all its twisted, brilliant, sadistic, dark and sometimes funny personality to live on the big screen. This is the last movie that Heath Ledger filmed completely and I believe some how he saved the best for last as he managed to put an outstanding final act of a realistic Joker and managed to put a smile on our faces before death brings down the curtains on his talent."
The Dark Knight,07-Jul-08,"Christopher Nolan's second bundle of joy ""The Dark Knight"" EXCEEDED all  of my expectations!!! With the success of 2005's reboot of the Batman  franchise, they took what was already established and expanded it,  amped it up, and gave a deeper, darker and brooding story that is more  gripping and the suspense is likely to catch you of guard several times  throughout. Christian Bale delves more deeper into Batman, sworn to  fight evil and injustice, though also quite reluctant and uncertain if  his crusade can ever end and cleanse his inner turmoil from his  fractured soul due to the murder of his beloved parents. But with the  help of his trusted butler/ally Alfred (played superbly by Michael  Cane) grounds him, gives him moral support, and keeps him in check. But  the real star of the show is Heath Ledger as Batman's most deadly  enemy, The Joker. I can HONESTLY tell you that: as good as Jack  Nicholson was in Batman'89 he is CHILD'S PLAY compared to this Joker.  He is sadistic, psychotic, and downright SCARIER and PSYCHOLOGICALLY  disturbing than the previous incarnation of The Clown Prince of Crime  and Ledger gives it his all to do him justice. Along with the original  cast comes some fresh faces such as Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal  and more. I must say though I liked Katie Holmes, Gyllenhaal gives a  much better performance and is a far cry from the ""damsel-in-distress""  stereotype (though there's a little of it, THANKFULLY) that's common in  films. Bale and Gyllenhall have MUCH better chemistry this time around  more so than Holmes. Even better, the fight sequences are vastly  improved and feature more brutal and bone crushing combat than ""Begins""  in addition to new technology at Batman's disposal.  Also worth mentioning is screenwriter Jonathan Nolan, who gives the  film an added frosting to an already delicious cake.  Simply put, The Dark Knight is totally more bad ass than ""Begins."" The  action is great, and the plot is more deeper and engrossing. I applaud  Christopher Nolan, Christian Bale, and especially Heath Ledger (who  sadly passed away earlier this year) and all those aboard for believing  in Mr. Nolan's talents for this second installment. Although some may  feel a bit of melancholy over Ledger's death, but as a final note I  will say this sincerely from my heart: Remember Heath Ledger and honor  him in your minds and hearts not only for his performances, but as a  human being and father to his daughter Matilda  Ledger. May we issue him best wishes for his family and friends and his  daughter for years to come. Remember . . . Honor him not only for this  role and past roles, but as an incredible individual and talented  actor.  Rest in peace. Heath Ledger: 4/4/1979-1/22/2008."
The Dark Knight,16-Jul-08,"I used to leave a theatre after seeing a highly anticipated movie, specifically a sequel, and be so revved up about what I saw that I would declare that movie to be the best of a series. After each of the prequel ""Star Wars"" films, I rated that one the best, as good as any of the originals...for a time, until my opinion balanced out and I had a more well-rounded take. For that reason, I steer away from that mindset, and did for ""Dark Knight"".Though my opinion is solidifying already after having seen a Warner Bros. screening last night, ""Dark Knight"" ably stands on its own with or without ""Batman Begins"". At a two and a half hour runtime, it's definitely an epic of a movie, but one that never runs out of gas. A delightful addition to this experience was a healthy amount of IMAX footage, which significantly adds to the feel of being on a personal, and gruesome, tour of Gotham City.Christian Bale plays such a well rounded Batman and Bruce Wayne, qualities that none of those who have donned the cowl before him have pulled off. I still have to remember that Bale is British since he speaks with such a spot on American accent. Bale has a particular slurring lisp that serves him quite well, charmingly for Bruce Wayne and threateningly for Batman.Countering him is the late Heath Ledger, who plays such a scary and creepy Joker that I found it impossible to NOT have chills half the time I saw him on screen. What really separates this brand of Joker from Jack Nicholson's portrayal is true unpredictability. It's obvious that, to be a good guy and think like the Joker, it really takes a toll, and it sure isn't easy. How exactly does one take him down when he's woven his harebrained plot around multiple hostages, explosives, or disappearing parlor tricks?Initially, I was uneasy about how the character of Harvey Dent would be handled. In my mind, there was really only one faithful portrayal of him, and that could be found in the ""Batman"" animated series of the early 90s. As well as Tommy Lee Jones COULD have handled him in ""Batman Forever"", he certainly did not, though it still was a highlight of that movie. Aaron Eckhart ably assumes the mantle here, delivering a performance out of this world, easily on par with the Batman animated series.Be it known, this caped avenger stands for the good of Gotham City that the police force and its counterparts can't represent, the good that has no jurisdiction, no procedures...and no rules, save for one. I can only hope that we've seen just the prelude to the Dark Knight's upcoming legendary battles with the worst of Gotham City's dark underside.""The Dark Knight"" gets a solid 10 of 10 stars."
The Dark Knight,16-Jul-08,"I must say I was excited for this movie since the instant BATMAN BEGINS appeared on screen at the end of the first film. It was always going to be good, and sadly, it was always going to be over-hyped by the advertising warhorses.It is rare though, that a movie can surpass all the hype and pass all expectations on the film. Nolan (The Prestige, Begins) delivers on more than the Joker we remember from the 'Old Days' of Burton and Nicholson. Instead we're given a psychopathic sadist who pleasures from sheer anarchy.All the hailing of Ledger's performance are grounded. Watching it will make you feel a different chill down your spine than you'd remember from any other film. It's impossible, quite literally to relate to The Joker. He gets inside your head with his stories of how he got his scars, makes you laugh at his sick jokes, then makes you instantly wonder why you're laughing.If Ledger wasn't enough to horrify you - wait for Harvey Dent. Brilliantly portrayed by Aaron Eckhart as Gotham's 'fallen White Knight' and Batman's direct counterpart. His transformation will put Tommy Lee Jones' portrayal look like children's breakfast cartoons. Gyllenhaal had perfect chemistry with both Bale and Eckhart, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman both work well as Batman's 'conscience' and of course, Gary Oldman as Lieutenant Gordon were all solid.There are some major differences between The Dark Knight and Begins. Firstly, the music is extremely disconcerted compared with the 'majestic but unfinished' tones of Begins - but it suits the film's tone: Anarchy in every sense. There was a more solid singular villain (compared with the many in Begins) - but there was also a lot more henchmen in TDK. The martial art direction was faster and more efficient - as mentioned in the film, learning through experience.I was disappointed at the role of Scarecrow in this film, it just felt like a loose thread and wasn't quite closed up or explained, and the ending, while it wasn't what I expected (others have said that it was predictable, but for me it wasn't) was solid and suited the film well.All in all, this is a film that is quite close, if it isn't already, a masterpiece. Nolan has a great thing going and unlike previous 'Superhero' adaptations (Spiderman and Fantastic Four for example), there isn't campiness creeping in. In face, if Batman Begins was 10/10, The Dark Knight deserves a 12. Quite simply, the best possible sequel that could've been given.If you watch this (which I implore that you do), you certainly won't regret it. One of the best movies of 2008 (I'll wait till Quantum of Solace comes out before I pass judgement) - but certainly a film worth getting excited for. If you don't like it, then that's also fine - but keep in mind that you probably thought Meet The Spartans was a good movie, so the rest of us won't take it to heart.Stunning in every aspect, and exceeds all hype and expectation... Can't wait to watch it again, or for the Blu-Ray!"
The Dark Knight,16-Jul-08,"I think the big question...or the question everyone actually cares about is this: Is Christopher Nolan's follow up to the critically acclaimed 2005 film ""Batman Begins,"" The Dark Knight, as good as everyone is saying? Quite simply, yes, yes it is. There is no doubt about it, one of the most anticipated movies of the 21st century duly deserves every amount of praise lavished onto it. This is no ordinary superhero movie, this is a character and dialogue driven piece, not as action orientated as you might expect.I will not go into plot details, because there is a lot of it. However, a basic one sentence summary is: Batman now has to face his most cunning and psychotic enemy, someone with no real motives...The Joker. Now that that is out of the way, I will start off with the actors (and boy, is there a lot to talk about). Christian Bale has done a tremendous job as our beloved Caped Crusader, with him already blowing everyone else out of water with ""Batman Begins."" Bruce Wayne has a flawed personality that hangs on the balance between righteousness and criminal. His perception of justice causes an emotional and personal shift, whether he is a wealthy businessman who fights crime in a gadget-riddled suit or just a normal man who is sick of all the scum in Gotham City and decides to give the law-breakers a dose of their own medicine. Because of this, and Bale's tremendous acting, Bruce Wayne is justified, and we emphasise with Bale's flawed hero more than any of the other actors. If there ever was an excellent Batman, this is it. The theme of right and wrong is played well with his character here.Of course, I am sure you all want know if Heath Ledger was that good. And I can safely say that he most definitely was. Ledger's Joker is not only the best, but is now the greatest superhero film villain ever. His performance is truly terrifying, chilling, brilliant; any synonyms of the previous adjectives. Every scene he is in is stolen. The Joker truly is Batman's worst villain; cunning and psychotic, nothing quite matches his laugh and sinister makeup. If Ledger nabs the Oscar for Best Actor, I honestly will not be surprised. It is a true tragedy to see such a talented actor fall at such a young age...All the other actors cannot be forgotten, though. Aaron Eckhart has definitely proved himself previously (""Thankyou for Smoking"") as someone to watch out for. Here, as Harvey Dent (and later Two Face) he is very powerful. All he wants is justice; to bring down every single criminal. Eckhart is the definitive Two Face. Maggie Gyllenhaal as Wayne and Dent's love interest, Rachel Dawes is much better than Katie Holmes. Gyllenhaal's performance has substance, I really cared for her and her future and she was terrific in every scene. Michael Caine can do no wrong, and as Alfred Pennyworth he provides some comical and emotional scenes. Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, although a limited role, does inject some sly humour and much needed morals into the story. Finally, Gary Oldman's Lt. James Gordon is riveting. He at least needs a Best Supporting Actor nomination for his performance as another crime-fighting hero who faces some challenging situations.Wally Pfister's cinematography is simply stunning. Gotham has never looked so good, so big and deep. His wide shots purvey a dirty aura and contribute to the feel of the film. Without it, it may not have been the same. Another Oscar worthy portion, THE MUSIC! With Hans Zimmer AND James Newton Howard at the helm, how could it go wrong? The score sets the mood in every scene, giving an epic and thrilling tone. During the action sequences it really ups the adrenaline. And on the topic of action, The Dark Knight succeeds in having the best fight sequences and car chases in a comic book adaptation yet. With no obvious or over-use of CGI, the explosions and accidents are the real deal. Thrilling, edge of your seat and violent, this is brutally awesome stuff.Nevertheless, none of this would be possible without Christopher Nolan, the man behind it all. Pairing up with the writer (and brother) Jonathon Nolan, the darkest Batman movie yet is the best, and the best so far this year. This does not feel like a comic book film, the dialogue and situations feel so realistic. And, it IS the script that drives this film. The dialogue is very, very well written and is the centre of the conflict and the movie.It may be bold to say this, but this is the best superhero film of all time. There are others that are magnificent (""Superman"" and ""X-Men"" are two examples) but this is the most complex, the most dark and the most spectacular and epic of them all. See it for Bale, for Ledger, for the music, the action and for Nolan's flawless direction.5/5 and the best film of 2008 so far!!"
The Dark Knight,16-Jul-08,"I thought Batman Begins was a very well conceived and put together  movie. We finally get Batman as a fully rendered character. We gain new  insight into his motivations and the variables he must contend with in  his role as protector of Gotham. We get to see Gary Oldman as an  honest-to-goodness good guy. And we get to see Liam Neeson conducting  perhaps his strangest facial hair experiment yet.  But after seeing The Dark Knight, Batman Begins will forevermore be  viewed (by me at least) as a handy little prologue to a FRICKIN'  MASTERPIECE of a superhero film.  To say it's the deepest mainstream comic adaptation ever produced would  be akin to calling the Nolan/Ledger Joker 'a bit eccentric'.  While watching it, I found myself thinking it was very long, which is  usually a sign that it's TOO long, and therefore boring. But that's not  actually the case here. The script is bulging with ideas, philosophical  musings, THEMES, which Christopher Nolan is not content to gloss over  in favour of cool set-pieces (as many comic adaptations are), but wants  to explore, wants to allow the characters to explore, at a logical  pace. So, what I guess I'm saying is, considering what it sets out to  do, the movie is long ENOUGH, while still constantly holding the  viewer's interest.  And that's not to say the thematic exploration comes at the EXPENSE of  big action, either. On the contrary, there is some truly awesome stuff  going on here. The chase with the truck, for example, is fantastic, and  there's some great hand-to-hand stuff too.  But what engages us most is the characters, and, while the script is  brilliant (the dialogue is sharp, and quite funny for the first  two-thirds, before the drama really kicks in), this mainly comes down  to the cast.  Christian Bale. Taller than Michael Keaton was. More menacing than Val  Kilmer was. Less like Adam West than George Clooney was. Solid and  committed as always. He gives the character LIFE, and actually makes us  feel for him. The word 'tortured' keeps coming to mind...and I suppose  it's pretty appropriate.  Heath Ledger. Y'know, I'd heard talk of an Oscar nomination, and  thought it sounded a bit dubious. A Batman villain? Winning an Oscar?  Is that what it's come to? Then I thought, is it because he didn't get  one for Brokeback? Or more dubious still...is it because he...died?  But...well...how can I put it...?   It seems a bit blasphemous to compare Jack Nicholson to Cesar Romero,  but after seeing Heath at work...Jack (who once seemed so awesome) just  looks...well...lame.  If you've seen it, you hopefully get what I mean. If you haven't...you  need to. You will discover the true definition of commitment.  Maggie Gyllenhaal. I didn't have any problem with Katie in the first  one (at the time), but I doubt she could have pulled off the more  emotional stuff Rachel goes through here. Seeing recasting was  necessary (does Tom have a problem with his wife being involved with  Batman? Too many bad memories perhaps? Why am I even talking about such  garbage here?) they could have done a butt-load worse than Maggie. She  rocks.  As does Aaron Eckhart. But I'm not giving ANYTHING away. Suffice it to  say my mind was blown...AGAIN. Makes Tommy Lee Jones look like...you  get the idea.  Michael Caine. Still one of my favourite actors. Alfred is the shiz.  Morgan Freeman. Morgan Freeman. AOK.  Gary Oldman. As in BB, no mania. No psychosis. No nervous tics.  Absolute subtlety. Manages to hold his own alongside Christian, Heath  and Aaron without resorting to parlour tricks. Sign of spectacular  talent. Go Gaz.  Eric Roberts! William Fichtner! Michael Jai White! Tiny Lister!  The whole thing is just a big bag of thoughtful, well-executed  entertainment. It's equal parts cerebral and visceral. Ideas and  action.  I've liked every Batman movie so far (okay, besides Batman & Robin),  but this one makes them all look pretty bloody ordinary."
The Dark Knight,07-Jul-08,"I had the honor of watching TDK during a screening and was completely blown away! This isn't just the best Batman movie ever made, this is one of the best movie ever made. Everything in this film is excellent, not one piece of annoyance.Bale marvels as Bruce Wayne/Batman, Ledger has made The Joker in to an iconic movie villain. His performance belongs there at the top with Hopkins Lecter. The Joker has finally been portrait properly on film, he has earned his place between the big boys in movie villandom. This is the true Joker every Batman fan knows, loves and fears. Ledger deserves any and every movie award known to man for this brilliant display.Nolan has made his ""I will always be remembered"" movie, this is the crownjewel in his portfolio. Perfect directing, perfect story, perfect balance between action and drama, everything is perfect. Even if you hate Batman, you will love this film. If you don't, then something beez wrongz with youz!"
The Dark Knight,16-Jul-08,"Well here it is, one of the most anticipated movies of the year so far. How was it? It was excellent. By far the best Batman film ever made and of course it will be one of the most memorable action films for a long while.Everyone was waiting to see how well Heath Ledger performed as The Joker in this film. He definitely deserves an Oscar in his honor. The character was so dark and creepy that it sent chills up my back. Compared to Heath's other films like '10 Things I Hate About You' and even 'Brokeback Mountain' proves that this man could actually act, doesn't matter what character, he could do it.The film's storyline has many twists and all are rewarding, the story is developed constantly after each scene, making you wonder what's next. Excellent craft and flows well towards the conclusion.During the film on the scene with Batman against the Joker, Bike vs Truck. People thought this was the ending. No, it kept going which was awesome, the story kept getting darker and darker, I guess that's why they called it the 'Dark' Knight as well as the relation to Batman himself.The cast was great. With Christopher Nolan playing Batman, good performance, Heath Ledger played extremely well, Maggie was annoying at times, but still deserves to be praised. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman had minor roles which satisfied the audiences. Aaron Eckhart starts with a minor role which slowly progresses and becomes evil which is quite surprising and entertaining to watch.Great directing made the movie enjoyable, they added more action this time which made the film feel powerful, lighting was done well especially showing Harvey/ Two Face's face in the many moods he displayed.Great explosions made it entertaining. Made you feel great that this is finally the best action to come in a long time.This movie deserves a 10/10 rating and credit on behalf of the great young actor Heath Ledger's life. (May he R.I.P) His performance made what this film is right now.I recommend this film for any action fan, especially a Batman fan. Or if your even a Heath Ledger fan. Go ahead right now and see this film. It's great!"
The Dark Knight,01-Oct-19,Amazing film. Closest thing we will ever get to a perfect superhero movie.
The Dark Knight,17-Jul-08,"(Synopsis) Bruce Wayne/Batman (Christian Bale) continues to eliminate crime in Gotham City with the help of Lt. Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman) and the new District Attorney, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart). The Dark Knight wants to finally get rid of organized crime for good and be free of their corruption. Batman soon finds that a new psychopathic mastermind known as the Joker (Heath Ledger) has taken over organized crime. The Joker's plan is to terrify the citizens and throw the city into chaos, and kill Batman. Batman takes the fight with the Joker personal, which makes him confront his own beliefs. The Joker is the most dangerous criminal that Batman has encountered, and he will need all his strength and vigilance to defeat him.(My Comment) This film just blew me away. Christian Bale is a natural as Bruce Wayne/Batman, and Michael Caine fits the part of Alfred, the trusted butler. Heath Ledger's performance as the sadistic Joker was absolutely disturbing and scary yet simply amazing. I would not want to meet the Joker in a dark alley, and whatever you do, don't ask him how he got his smile, especially, when he has a knife in his hand. Ledger's performance has turned the Joker into a new iconic movie villain image. Between all the punches, mayhem, and explosions, there is some good sinister dialog. The movie not only has a lot of action, it also tells the story of the internal struggle that Bruce Wayne is having with being the Batman hero. Bruce Wayne wants to be himself and maintain the difference between himself and Batman. Bruce must decide to follow the code or do what has to be done without affecting his own morals. The movie explores the literary themes of Hero verses Villain, as well as Order verses Anarchy, and the Joker explains to Batman that to have one you must have the other, and because of that, they will always be connected. The movie is long, but it went by so fast. You will love the last 45 minutes, because of the non-stop action with Batman in his new sonic suit and his BatPod. With all the explosions, body count, and the dark mood of the movie, I don't think parents should take young children. (Warner Bros. Pictures, Run Time 2:32, Rated PG-13)(10/10)"
The Dark Knight,14-Jul-08,"Batman has always been my favourite superhero ever since the first time I heard about him because he his human with no powers, also he is much more questionable than any other superhero. The story of the film is about Batman, Lieutenant James Gordon, and new district attorney Harvey Dent beginning to succeed in rounding up the criminals that plague Gotham City. They are unexpectedly challenged when a mysterious criminal mastermind known as the Joker appears in Gotham. Batman's struggle against the Joker becomes deeply personal, forcing him to ""confront everything he believes"" and to improve his technology (which introduces the recreation of the Batcycle, known as the Batpod and the Batsuit was redesigned) to stop the madman's campaign of destruction. During the course of the film, a love triangle develops between Bruce Wayne, Dent and Rachel Dawes.There are now six Batman films and I must say that The Dark Knight is the best out of all of them. The title is good because that is what Batman actually is. It has been 3 years for the adventure to continue from Batman Begins but that entire wait was worth it. Gotham city is very Gothic looking and is very haunting and visionary. The whole movie is charged with pulse-pounding suspense, ingenious special effects and riveting performances from a first-rate cast especially from Heath Ledger who gave an Oscar nomination performance for best supporting-actor. It is a shame that he can't see his terrific work on-screen. The cinematography is excellent which is made so dark & sinister that really did suit the mood for the film. Usually sequels don't turn out to be better than the original but The Dark Knight is one of those rare sequels that surpasses the original like The Godfather 2. I also really liked the poster where the building is on fire in a Bat symbol & Batman is standing in front of it. Christopher Nolan is a brilliant director and his film Memento is one of my most favourite films. He hasn't made 10 movies yet and 3 of them are already on the IMDb top 250. Overall The Dark Knight is the kind of movie that will make the audience cheer in the end instead of throwing fruit & vegetables on the screen."
The Dark Knight,07-Oct-19,"11 years after Gotham City was rocked by Heath Ledger's Joker, The Dark Knight is still holding the title as the greatest superhero movie ever made.This movie will forever be the film every future Batman movie will be measured against. The Dark Knight is my idea of the perfect movie completing various character arcs and requiring no build up. One did not need to watch Batman Begins to understand The Dark Knight, despite these movies being in a series. The Avengers films require the previous Marvel MCU films to be seen prior to the superheroes fighting Loki, Ultron, and Thanos.Reviews for The Dark Knight continue to be written, and lengthy analysis videos posted on YouTube. This movie is still the greatest film of all time."
The Dark Knight,19-Jul-08,"The Dark Knight maintained the intensity and overall gunmetal grayish feel that sets this Batman apart. The film takes us to a Gotham City that has grown accustomed to the big bat's crime-fighting crusades, and the last remaining big time criminals have actually grown fearful of his wrath. They form an alliance to attempt to keep their illicit business activities alive but are feeling even more pressure from yet a different angle: the passionate and fearless new district attorney, Harvey Dent. Recognizing the crime group's looming extinction, a stranger enters their circle and offers what he thinks is the only solution: kill Batman.The bad guys don't know if they can trust this seemingly demented madman, and they later learn the hard way that they don't really have a choice, for the most disturbing part of the Joker's personality is his motive. He doesn't care about money or power. He just enjoys causing trouble and watching, with pleasure, from the sidelines, as the terrorized city scrambles in mayhem...which leads me to the real star of this film, Heath Ledger.Ledger's performance as the Joker is astounding and consuming. We come face-to-face with a villain bearing the coldness of a psychopath and a personality that remains as mysterious and inexplicable as the real reason for the scars on his face. He develops the air of the lone offender quite early on as he nonchalantly kills those who help him commit his crimes. Yet, he has no problem building an army of followers, and the viewers easily find that believable. As insane as he is, he's focused and quite determined. Ledger also brings the Joker's humor to the role, but he does it in a way that is unique to this interpretation...with subtlety and honesty. The very words and mannerisms that made me laugh also evoked feelings of sadness in its clarity. The evil is incredibly convincing.Although Batman is a character that is often marketed towards kids, this film is definitely not appropriate for young children. In addition to the dark images, the violence, both seen and implied, is sometimes unsettling, and Ledger's Joker is chilling even for adult viewers. Having said that, this is, by far, one of the best films I've ever seen, and it will easily find a place in my personal top ten. I am only disappointed that this Joker, the best villain in a film since Hannibal Lecter, will never be revealed to us again."
The Dark Knight,08-Oct-19,There are few movies where you just feel privileged because you get to watch them and are honoured to. This is one of them.
The Dark Knight,20-Apr-12,"Let's open this review with the fact that Batman is THE BEST superhero ever, with no other even coming close to his levels. So when a sequel is made for an unforgettable movie like ""Batman Begins"" expectations are EXTREMELY high. I think that if you could describe this movie in a few words it would be ""152 minutes of pure awesomeness."" Christopher Nolan probably created the best ever comic book adaptation of a movie. The movie itself has been adapted in a much more realistic fashion than the comic book series. First of all this movie is PERFECT for people who like punches, drama, shooting and explosions. The movie has a complicated plot that keeps your eyes glued to the screen. It's anything BUT corny, since a few important characters die, and the ending isn't happy, but it's flawless. Christian Bale has proved himself one again as an amazing actor. Michael Cane (portrays Alfred Pennyworth) makes you fall in love with Batman's loyal butler. Now anyone that has seen the movie and is reading this review is probably wondering why I haven't mentioned the main reason why this movie is flawless. And yes, there is ONE main reason: Heath Ledger. Heath Ledger portrayed Batman's arch nemesis in this movie: the Joker. Now anyone who has a clue in comic books knows that the Joker is INCREDIBLE. Heath Ledger's acting in this movie has turned the Joker into a LEGEND. I have never seen such perfect and realistic acting than the portrayal of the Joker in this movie. The Joker is portrayed in a much more mature fashion than the comic books, and that's why it was so good. It's simply impossible to describe him: he's bold, insane, smart, twisted and he's so awesome in this film that at some points you love him even more than Batman. If I haven't mentioned it by now, this is without a doubt the best movie I have seen.Those who come with high expectations after seeing ""Batman Begins"" will not be disappointed. I advise that no one under the age of 11 watches this movie as Two-Face's appearance is rather frightening and the film contains intense action."
The Dark Knight,14-Jul-08,"I have just come out of the ""Dark Curtain"" Screening for The Dark Knight in Adelaide, and I'm blown away.Nolan's directing is sublime, the pacing of the movie was so well kept, managing to keep the audience enthralled in an almost 3 hour movie. There were several shots in the film that had me saying ""Now how in the hell did they do that?!"", Brilliant scores by James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer. Every actor shines, no one person steals the film. I don't want to say much about it, because whatever is said cannot do it justice, there is enough hype surrounding it's release, but it's there for a reason. Top Notch film. Bravo to Nolan and his crew for giving a movie that Batman truly deserves.9/10."
Trolls World Tour,15-Mar-20,Watched this high. Weird movie.... probably the only way to watch it
Trolls World Tour,16-Apr-20,"It was ok. My kids (ages 4 and 7) lost focus many times while watching. The music was pretty good, but nowhere near as good as the first Trolls movie."
Trolls World Tour,06-Apr-20,"With all that's happening in the world right now, this movie is perfect. I liked the first Trolls movie, but I LOVEEEEE this one!! I love animation movies in general but this franchise is definitely some of my favorites. I think I may be a bit biased because I love both Anna Kendrick and JT, and their friendship offscreen too. But one thing I didn't like as is the fact that Anna's vocals are still not as featured in the soundtrack, even though she is the lead character."
Trolls World Tour,12-Apr-20,"This movie cannot decide if it wants to support individuality or group mentality. Early on there is a lesson about people being people no matter who or what they are. Then halfway through it explains the dangers of homogeneity. By the end, it tried to teach the old separate but equal thinking. I know it's a movie made for children, but there was no clear message. My 8 year old daughter asked me what the moral of the movie was, and I didnt know what to tell her."
Trolls World Tour,19-Apr-20,"What on Earth was this?
I watched the first Trolls with my son and was taken aback by the quality of story and music they had for the first one. The arrangement for ""Sound of Silence"" was so surprisingly good it made me misty eyed... The music in this sequel is beyond subpar... The continuity is confusing and has nothing to do with the first movie, to the point that I'm literally lost how the first one could have happened in this Troll universe. Honestly, I am not surprised on how dumbed down this movie was. Also- the movie says ""different music for each land"", yeah, it's all pop. Don't waste your time."
Trolls World Tour,14-Mar-20,"Initially I thought this film would be just cute characters singing pop songs all the time. In fact there is a plot which touches heartstrings too. The colour scheme is kaleidoscopic, and the music is infectiously catchy. It is one big party, but it also has a message for adults to think about. I enjoyed this way more than I thought I would."
Trolls World Tour,17-Mar-20,"I had watched the first trolls and enjoyed The story, friendship, and music. I went into the second movie with high hopes and expectations. I understand the message that they were attempting to portray in the movie to all children, but doing so took some of the fun out of the movie. Kudos for the message that they were attempting to send to all children and adults, but doing so took some of the fun out of the movie. Overall, it was somewhat slow but still a fun watch. Whether your children get the message or not, they will still enjoy the movie."
Trolls World Tour,12-Apr-20,"This film is just a colourful incoherent mess.We were big fans of the first film in our house and have watched it numerous times. So when we heard there was going to be a sequel we knew we'd be heading to the cinema. Alas that was not to be, so when it was announced the film would be avaliable to rent via streaming we decided to rent it on Easter Sunday. I'm thankful that I didn't have to trek to the cinema to watch it but annoyed that I paid over £16 to watch it in the comfort of my own house.The first film had character and charm, catchy songs, and a decent story that conveyed an important message. This film has none of the above. The storyboard consisted of nothing more than someone throwing an obscene amount of glitter at it and then craming as many songs as possible into it. And none of the songs were 'Get Back Up Again' standout.Clearly the scriptwriters couldn't agree on whether Poppy was right all along or wrong all along as both are confirmed to be true. They then decided to tack a 'music comes from within' message to the end as an afterthought copying the 'happiness comes from within' one of the first film.Obviously I don't expect an Oscar worthy movie from a Trolls film and there's always an element of copy and pasting the formula of the first film with sequels. But this film just missed the beat everytime. For example they reused the character pooping confectionary from the first film but completely omit the Bergen which is criminal.If I could give a minus score I would."
Trolls World Tour,05-Jul-20,"I was so excited to watch this one with my kids. The first movie had a pretty good plot, likeable characters, and some good songs. All of this combined with the premise of different genre music trolls sounded pretty cool.But the plot is convoluted and moves and breakneck speed. Queen Barb is annoying and the music is just one long mashup with no actual songs.Also, when I think of a female singer to introduce the country trolls I think Reba or Dolly Parton. Nope they used Kelly Clarkson. All of the genres are Pop doing an imitation of it."
Trolls World Tour,06-Apr-20,"Fun feel good film for the family, My 6 year old Daughter absolutely loved it! Just what we needed, a little escape as we were planning to go to the movies to watch"
Trolls World Tour,07-Apr-20,I still enjoyed Trolls 1 bit more. It packed bit stronger emotional punch.Either way I'm happy I watched Trolls 2. It definitely isn't a weak sequel :)
Trolls World Tour,10-Apr-20,Really bad. The first Trolls Movie was fantastic. This was just pointless and horrible. No storyline just a desperate attempt to put 50 songs into one movie. My kids lost interest immediately. Really bummed.
Trolls World Tour,11-Apr-20,"Loved the first trolls, but wow what and underwhelming, cracked out ride. We're they on opioids when they made this movie because some parts are so random and the story is lacking an actual story. Where are the Bergens? Also, hate when actors get changed out some voices not the same.This movie lacks focus, lacks good songs, and a good storyline. Very disappointed!"
Trolls World Tour,12-Apr-20,"The first was truly excellentThis seems rushed, quick we need a film quick we need a themeNot very original, all bits put together, not real foot thumping tunes.The plot so obvious even 4 year old knew what was going to happen!Such a shame"
Trolls World Tour,19-Apr-20,We were looking forward to this movie. But it was terrible. Someone was on drugs making this movie. Very weird. All 4 of our kids did not like it. Ranging from ages 8-14. Waste of time and money.
Trolls World Tour,10-Apr-20,We tried to watch Onward (Pixar) twice and my four year old asked to turn it off. I recalled the new Trolls film was for rent on Prime so we switched it over.My kid is glued to the television with Trolls. It's keeping her attention and she likes the songs. The makers of the film had a certain target audience in mind when they made this film and I'd say it was highly successful.I suspect I will have to watch this film more than once today.
Trolls World Tour,11-Apr-20,How many time can you repeat the same message of people are different but alike? the script writers sure their audience are very stupid...
Trolls World Tour,05-May-20,"In the first movie Branch gets his colour back when he gets his Troll happiness. Turns a teal with bright purple hair. In this one, his hair is Navy blue/black. It changed once, when they did their Country scene. I HATE when they change the looks of characters. The songs were good, to me. But when Poppy finds out about Pop trolls taking the Funk trolls string (or whatever it was), they never sort of tied those strings up, no exploration of that event etc."
Trolls World Tour,11-Apr-20,Such a waste of time. A conflict from nowhere appeared just to make a second movie and then turned out to be completely pointless
Trolls World Tour,08-Apr-20,"The movie shows we can all be different and still live in harmony. It'd be awfully boring to look and sound the same. Just like it was said in the movie 'if we all look the same, act the same and dress the same, how would anyone know we cool? I love this."
Trolls World Tour,13-Apr-20,"The most accurate review I have is you need to be high to watch this movie. It feels like the script was written over a weekend. The movie is just weird in moments and not in a good way like the first one. It lacks the humorous contrast between poppy and branch that made the first movie work. This movie just tried too hard to be something. The overall message of the movie is good, but the execution is terrible."
Trolls World Tour,12-Apr-20,Storyline is weak! Given a 1 because I can respect all genres of music. Other than that movie is trash!
Trolls World Tour,07-Apr-20,"I don't really understand the bad reviews regarding this film. I understand that people are comparing it to the original but last night me, my partner and my two 7 year old children sat down to watch it (both were huge fans of the first one!) And everybody loved it!! The kids laughed out loud throughout and were so engrossed they didn't even nag for extra snacks! Haha.
The film is a lovely, feel good movie with a great message that everyone is equal. Personally I know my kids will be wanting to re-watch this film many, many times!!!!"
Trolls World Tour,07-Jun-20,"Holy crap, what a terrible sequel. Is this the best they can think up?The first movie was so much better with the plot. I am glad that we at least didn't pay the full $20 that was originally charged.I thought the first five minutes was going to be good, then it all fell apart. The underwater scene really pissed me off.The characters are lacking in continuity. The plot is stupid. The script has terrible dialog. It sucked completely. I was really looking forward to a good sequel."
Trolls World Tour,23-Apr-20,One of the richest genres of music is rock and i donno why but everyone is trying to just make a bad picture of it children's minds and of course they grow up and they'll be the same people who say rock and metal music is satanic and one of the greatest genres of music is ruined in their minds by this cartoon and the idea of the rock music being bad. Im not saying that the children will get any of that but i believe the unconsciousness to be a powerfull thing.
Scoob!,16-May-20,"The first 15 mins of this are great. Why they couldn't have just kept this as an origin story of how the gang met and started solving mysteries is beyond me. Instead the story spirals off into a million directions and is filled with tons of poorly executed pop culture references. The animation is stellar, but the plot diminishes this one a lot. I'm not expecting it to be just like the TV series, but my kids got more excited at the beginning of the movie and started to lose interest as it went on. Sometimes I wonder if these screenwriters working on kids movies actually have kids. So disappointing and a big missed opportunity."
Scoob!,16-May-20,"I was never really the biggest fan of Scooby Doo. I watched some epispodes, but I never really gravitated to that show and characters. But even with watching so little episodes, you can tell it is very different from the cartoon. It doesn't feel like Scooby Doo. There aren't any mysteries of haunted houses. This is a superhero movie wth Scooby Doo characters.The villian is actually pretty good. He has a clear motivation and you understand what's he doing and why he's doing it. He can also be funny which is perfect for a kids movie like this.The voice actors did a good job. The stand-outs for me are Mark Whalberg, Jason Isaacs and Frank Welker.The movie is really funny and a lot of the jokes land well. Especially with the character of Fred. Whenever he's on screen he gives that funny vibe and you can't help it but to laugh whenever he tells a joke.The biggest problem for me is that this is just a generic kids movie. It follows the same formula as all kids movies. Set-up a relationship with two characters, seperate them and make them reconcile, earn the power of friendship and save the day. On top of that, add a bunch of pop songs. The movie is afraid to take risks and shake things up. Because that, it doesn't add anything new to the genre, it doesn't add anything new to the Scooby Doo characters and it's just forgetable. If i'm in a mood for Scooby Doo, I won't watch this. I will watch the original cartoon. If I'm in a mood for a 21st century kids movie, I won't watch this. I will just go watch the Lego Movie. My point is that this movie doesn't stand out in any way.I conslusion, I don't think that a generic kids movie is worth 20 dollars.4/10 you can skip it, you're not missing much."
Scoob!,15-May-20,"It doesn't matter what age we are when it comes to Scooby Doo it was, is & always will be a must watch. Now if you're following the Scooby-Doo animated / Cartoons series or movies then you already know how cross overs are common & Scoob is no different you'll see other Characters from Hanna-Barbera such as Blue-Falcon and his Dog , Dick Dastardly from Wacky Racers as the main Antagonist alongside Muttley with a Cameo providing you the total nostalgic journey especially if your 90's kids or older. Film follows how Scoob and the gang met when they were children's following the Scooby-Doo theme song 'Scooby Dooby Doo Where Are You? We Got Some Work To Do Now' with same picturization as we've seen in 90's.
The Movie is set-ed in modern times where you'll find IKEA , Netflix's jokes along with Insta & Selfies.
The major weak point about the movie was the mystery part as when it comes to Scooby Doo there has to be a ghost, ending with that iconic removal of Face Mask following 'Those Meddling Kids' but sadly you wont see that this time and that's Sad Very Very Sad."
Scoob!,16-May-20,"I realize that Scoob is basically a kids' cartoon generic movie. I realize that I am long past the target audience's age. However, I grew up a fan of the original Scooby Doo cartoon. I was 4 years-old when the cartoon originally aired and I have fond memories of those Saturday mornings. The people responsible for making these new movies have taken most of what made that show good and thrown it out the window. The ghosts and monsters weren't real. There was always a rational explanation behind everything that went on. Part of the fun was trying to wrap my 4 year-old brain around how the bad guys were doing their evil deeds. But a movie based in anything approaching reality wouldn't work as a big, over-bloated, CGI mess like SCOOB. It's unreal, it's loud, and it leaves nothing to the imagination. The film consistently makes fun of itself in that I'm-smarter-than-you, self-referential way that I find so annoying. It's a shame to me that young kids today will not grow-up understanding the charm of the original Scooby Doo."
Scoob!,15-May-20,"My boyfriend and I waited months for this. He loves scooby doo. He bought his niece scooby doo for christmas, to promote his propaganda of Scooby Doo. He woke up today, the 15th May, his first words saying ""its Scoob day!"". We brought snacks in the middle of this pandemic and brought them home. We watched it, and I saw the light from his eyes leave when Simon Cowell (????) was introduced, when blue falcon dabbed and made cringey jokes, etc. He's a ruined man. Velma does not sound like Velma. All for a shared universe, you've destroyed a man. The first 15 minutes were good though hence the extra star lol."
Scoob!,16-May-20,Did not have the classic Scooby Vibe. Trying to hard to be hip. Mystery Incorporated cartoon was so much better.
Scoob!,22-May-20,"For those hoping to watch a fun origin story of scooby doo or maybe a fun giant epic mystery adventure film, unfortunately this film misses that mark. What you should expect to see is another average CGI animated cliche and extremely bland and predictable super hero film. This film tried to accomplish too much during its runtime, that is ends up accomplishing nothing!"
Scoob!,20-May-20,"This movie dies after the first 15 minutes. It starts and it's super cute and actually resembles Scooby-Doo. But then it just goes off the rails. It has stupid cameos, pop culture nonsense like dabbing?? It was so basic. The plot was just nonsense and boring.I don't love the animation style they look like they are made from each plastic and the voice acting is kinda off putting because for the most part non of the characters sound like any incarnation of them from the past which is strange as some of the old cast members spoke about wanting to return and were disappointed not to be asked.My other complaint is there want really a main monster to fight against it seemed to randomly pop up in the end. It just didn't seem like Scooby-Doo"
Scoob!,16-May-20,"This movie was horrible, took Scooby Doo and turned it an ""Emoji Movie"" it has references for the older fans, but it takes the charm of Scooby Doo and turns it into a bad children's movie. Why have today's kids grow up with Scooby Doo being this way ? It was truely a disappointed. Keep the fans of older Scooby Doo and keep us out of it. Don't put references of the originals in something that isn't Scooby Doo at all. Its basically a whole different movie with the Scooby gang pasted into it, and that's just the appearances with new personalitys. Shouldve made this movie with the original animated Scooby Doo movies in mind and it would of been great..."
Scoob!,17-May-20,"I can see what they were going for by crossing over with other Hanna-Barbera characters, but in doing so, I think that they stripped away a lot of what makes Scooby-Doo so great. I was always drawn in by Mystery Inc's skepticism to all things supernatural and as a child, I felt that I could dip my toe into something spooky but the humour and adventure would balance it all out. Even in this film, snippets of the gang's spooky hijinks were the highlight for me and without that - I feel that there is no Scooby-Doo. In saying that, the animation was beautiful, I do love these characters and I think that Zac Efron was a perfect casting choice for Fred. I feel thankful that this has gone straight to streaming rather than a wide theatrical release, as I can only hope that a new generation finds a better entry point into Scooby-Doo rather than this film."
Scoob!,15-May-20,"I really wanted to like this movie. I truly did but this is not a Scooby-Doo movie. First of all PLEASE tell me why do they insist on having REAL monsters when the whole point of Scooby-Doo is disproving the supernatural. This is an ORGIN story and the origin of Scooby-Doo is having fake monsters. They completely ruin that aspect in the movie and have some type of underworld concept with 3 skulls opening the portals to the underworld. What on earth is that?! This is not the Scooby-Doo I grew up with. I'm so angry at myself for buying this movie such a waste of my money.
On top of that it's more of a Blue Falcon movie rather than a Scooby-Doo one. It has ZERO mystery in it and the comedy is forced and will age badly in a few years.The only good quality is the movie has great animation. Other than that I hated it and I will be contacting Apple on getting my money back.I'm a HUGE Scooby fan and I was immensely disappointed. :("
Scoob!,16-May-20,Another CGI 'product' that chucks out all of the charm of the original in favour of contemporary post-modern gibberish and self-referential jokes that do nothing but make all of the characters smug and unlikeable. I wish this was a cartoon. I wish it had a spooky mystery at its heart. I wish it was Scooby Doo.
Scoob!,15-May-20,We have come to love the cast for the last decade. Why take the heart out of the movie? Will Forte doesn't do Shaggy justice. The suspension of disbelief is gone with the cast of mystery inc. I want my money back
Scoob!,16-May-20,"I loved Scooby-Doo cartoons as a child, so I expected similar impressions and feelings from this animated film. There were also hopes that this franchise will still be able to revive. But, in my opinion, this is not the case at all.The plot. Nothing interesting here. Classic thrash plot of the last 10 years. Metal minions.... for me, this is an indicator of the lack of ideas in the writers of the cartoon.For fans of cool graphics it is a disappointment. 2020, but the film doesn't exactly reach the level.The main characters infuriated me more than forcing me to empathize. Especially Fred - a dumb-headed beauty.Jokes? I smiled only once. The complete primitive.Attitudes of children... My nephew, who was watching with me, went to another room 15 minutes after the start of the cartoon. It simply didn't interest the child, and this can already be called an indicator.4/10. Children will not be interested, adults don't need to waste time."
Scoob!,16-May-20,"Not the Scooby-Doo we all know and love. This is a ""spin-off"" of the franchise / series. Very flashy CGI garbage! The plot is EXTREMELY predictable, even for young kids. Everything about this film is just bland and boring. Not very interesting movie. Maybe VERY young kids will find some interest in the bright colors and characters goofiness. Don't recommend buying the ""home video release"" of this ! Not worth the price ! Wait for this to be on rental, or just watch a free scooby-doo episode or movie online for free !!"
Scoob!,15-May-20,"I'll be honest I was extremely DISAPPOINTED with this film. I won't be watching this movie again and I'm a bit mad at myself for wasting money on renting such a mediocre animated film/ story. Completely kids eye candy at best , nothing more here ."
Scoob!,15-May-20,"Gone is the 60s attire and tone and music that has been a staple of Scooby forever, replaced with awful 2020 setting and music...and no, I'm no boomer.
This movie sucks. It's not a ""prequel"" like advertised, and they've turned the characters into freakin caricatures of themselves with a millennial twist. For some reason they felt the need to make Velma into a Spanish girl who switches into speaking Spanish like Dora the explorer. Why not just add a new character to the team instead? It's not like they haven't recruited other people temporarily before. It's just seems like unnecessary pandering. I also don't understand the Simon Cowell thing...weird.
The other thing that really bothered me is that Scooby talks a LOT...like abnormally so, and in full sentences too. That is not something I remember seeing in anything previously and my kid watches a lot of Scooby. I don't care for the 2020 plot setting either...they use cellphones and hashtags and stuff. It just feels so not Scooby.
Whole I'm at it, Fred looks weird and they made him into essentially Homer Simpson or Peter Griffin level of stupid. Also Will Forte voices Shaggy and it's pretty awful...he sounds nothing like him. None of these things are helped by the awful plot either."
Scoob!,15-May-20,"Very disappointing movie. I was expecting so much more from it. It looks like scriptwriters were inspired by TikTok rather than by original series. If you were as ""lucky"" as I was and have seen the Emoji movie, then it is approximately on the same level. Trying hard, but nor reaching the point. Very wired for the young generation and too modern for old school viewers."
Scoob!,21-Jun-20,"It started well, with a touching scene of the main characters meeting for the forst time as kids (or puppies, in Scooby's case) and then having one of their traditional adventures. However, this only lasts 15 minutes, and from there the movie stops being a Scooby Doo movie and starts being a superhero movie, with Dick Dastardly as the supervillain, and Blue Falcon and his gang as superheroes, with the Scooby gang stuck there in a movie that is not their own.Because let's face it, just like in a James Bond movie we have certain expectations, in a Scoob movie we also have expectations, and they are not met. That distinctive type of adventures where they explore a haunted location and, after many scares, end up discovering that it was all a not supernatural trick by some criminal, is not here, except for a brief nod at the beginning. Instead, we get a generic modern children's movie, with characters running around from chase to chase, battle to battle and explosion to explosion without a compelling plot, while making pop culture references. The plot involves saving the world from a large-scale supernatural threat (really supernatural, none of the subversion characteristic of the source material).So, if we forget about wanting a Scooby Doo movie and focus on the movie we get, it's not very good either. You can see where they try to have jokes for the adult watchers, but they lack the wit and talent to make them funny. They occasionally remember that this is supposed to be a Scooby Doo movie, and they have traditional gags like having Scooby and Shaggy, in the middle of being chased by the critters, turn around and serve the critters as waiters, disconcerting them for a while, but it's too little and done without much talent. You also get a scene where two male characters fight and a female character says it's toxic masculinity, which is kind of a hateful message to send to children.In short, if you want a Scooby movie, this is not it, and if you want a generic modern kid's movie, this is not a good one."
Scoob!,15-May-20,"This will probably be the entry in the Scooby-Doo franchise that is going to equally divide its audience, with each side giving its own valid reasons. Some viewers are going to appreciate the modernization of the story, while others will wish it had stayed in the late 1960s. Some are going to get a kick out of the pop culture references, while others will ask themselves why they are in a Scooby-Doo movie. Some will appreciate the superhero theme, while others will forget that Blue Falcon and Dynomutt have existed in the past. Some will recoil at the childish crude humor, while others may giggle at it. Some longtime Hanna-Barbara fanatics are going to love the tie-in with other characters, while others are going to call it a forced attempt to kick-start a shared universe. It'll be very interesting to see how the overall consensus falls, and it'll also be up to the individual to form its own opinion. At the end of the day, it's a kids' film. That's the best anyone can say about it. It does what it can to introduce this franchise to a younger generation through those quirks and contemporary computer animation, while at the same time, it does have enough weight in the story and aims closer to the source material than more recent attempts, even when it doesn't always digest easy. It'll be up to you to decide where this lands. Obviously, it's more focused at entertaining today's kids than being a great entry in the Scooby-Doo canon. However, if it connects with the long-time meddling kids that grew up with the characters for over half a century, then it has definitely earned its extra Scooby Snack points."
Scoob!,16-May-20,"Not a bad movie but I don't know why you would choose to make a Scooby-Doo movie and not include Matthew Lilard, Grey DeLisel and Frank Welker. It's just a marketing ploy using bigger names and sacrificing quality for money. Still worth watching but could have been a lot better."
Scoob!,19-May-20,"This Scoob! Movie goes pretty much against the series we've all known and loved. It shows the movie's origins, and set, to be in the 21st century, with instagram posts, dabs and other honestly cringeworthy scene, as most pop references are way out of fashion and awkwardly shoved in with the script. The team doesn't solves a mystery, but instead basically tries to stop a super villain whose identity is known from the start. The only paranormal thing appears near the end and is...Actually paranormal, which goes against the series' concept : debunking paranormal activity. That appart, the music choice is really bad, and there are also political messages mixed in the movie. Velma ethnically Latin American in this movie, she even speaks in Spanish once. There are is also a commentary about ""Toxic masculinity"" when two of the protagonists are arguing in a comedic manner. The beginning of the movie was good and some scenes were alright. I was about to put a 3 star review, but then remembered that the little robot with a vacuum head is only there so that WB can sell merchs to little kids.So in conclusion, this movie is pretty much like a bad fan fiction made by a middle school teen who signed up in the political club. Don't waste your money on that."
Scoob!,17-May-20,"I had so many expectations. Scoob! sets on a completely different track from the original stories, which I would welcome if it was better written. The jokes are unfunny, the movie feels unenthusiastic just like Gina Rodriguez's voice for Velma. Stick to the Direct-to-Video animated films. They're clearly superior."
Scoob!,15-May-20,"Totally not what I was expecting from a Scooby-doo remake ! This was more like an kiddy action film with Scooby doo characters in it! Pretty lame and disappointing for adults and older audiences . If you have very young kids and don't know about Scooby-doo, they will absolutely love this, otherwise , SKIP IT! It's not what you are expecting it to be! Totally different concept of Scooby doo in this film."
Scoob!,16-May-20,I've seen every scooby-doo movie out there and all the Tv series . This is the worst. I was really looking forward for this for months and I'm so glad I didn't waste my time at the theaters for it. If you're a true Scooby-Doo fan you'll know it doesn't have any of the elements like the other ones.
Jumanji: The Next Level,04-Dec-19,"I saw the movie on December 4, Indonesian premiere.The whole story is a good follow up from the ""Welcome to the Jungle"" Jumanji-2 film, with some added actors (Danny DeVito and Danny Glover as a good choice.While I was confused in the beginning, who was who once they were back in the game, the script itself allowed the avators to be exchanged so that they went back to the ""Welcome to the Jungle"" avators and the people who were in those (I hope you understand what I mean).The story is simply a new adventure, and so much different from the previous instalment that it is not boring at all, and while it is rated PG13, I found that in general, it is a very good family movie.All in all, and in all honesty, I already look forward to Jumanji 4 (Xmas 2020 or Xmas 2021 would do just fine.Thumbs up for the movie, 8/10!"
Jumanji: The Next Level,06-Dec-19,"Before going to the cinema to see «The Next Level» of Jumanji, I rewatched the first movie, just to refresh my memory. And after watching the new one, I must say - it wasn't underwhelming at all!In addition to what the first film brought, new «Jumanji» has:
more jokes;a whole lot of new characters;a fresh look at the existing characters;plenty of new locations and thus, much more adventures;an absolute muddle of what's happening on the screen;and yes, even more jokes!Given the above, it's time to wrap it up - «Jumanji: The Next Level» is a solid following of a 2017's movie. It's all about laughter, fun, amusement and adventures, of course. In case if you seen «Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle» and enjoyed it, the new «Next Level» won't let you down."
Jumanji: The Next Level,06-Dec-19,"Mild, mild spoilers ahead....I was scared they'd somehow screw up the sequel to the ""reboot"" they did, but I was greatly surprise at the new elements they added: the grandpa's subplot and the way it was executed and their contribution to the jumanji gaming experience (they were both hilarious); and all the new additions felt exactly how a sequel to a 90s sequel game would feel like: new abilities and weapons and scenery (or the would-be ""levels"" of the game) they still felt like they'd actually be levels of a game! It's exactly what I hoped they'd add on because that's the kind of thing the first movie did, it tried to work with the stereotypes and elements found in those good old adventure games like Tomb Raider.I also liked that they brought back the WHOLE gang, the reason why movies like this where the most logical thing would be to make it anthologic, that is, with different kids experiencing the game; so when they try to use the same characters that supposedly learned something from their past experience in it, is a recipe for disaster because it's hard to bring all the gang together without it being forced. But i liked the way they did it, it felt controlled and fulfilling in the end.In conclusion, it was a funny, entertaining and creative action adventure movie, it's not gonna win any Oscars but it's so wrll thought of that it's a delight to watch and I feel it never grows old, you can rewatch it and enjoy it all over again"
Jumanji: The Next Level,08-Dec-19,"Even though its central concept seems ever-so-slightly more strained this time, 'Jumanji: The Next Level (2019)' is about as good as its predecessor. In fact, it's sometimes even better. Basically, the flick is just fun. The crowd-pleasing body-swapping is amped up to eleven, shaking things up just enough so that they feel fresh. The main actors continue to properly impress in their chameleon-like roles, joined by a few extra treats that perform far better than you'd perhaps expect. Indeed, these new players are probably its biggest asset; a couple of them thoroughly perforate the entire experience despite only having a rather small amount of screen-time. The picture is often funny - though, never hilarious - and is oddly endearing, to boot. It isn't particularly deep or, even, memorable but it doesn't need to be. It's a good time at the movies; what more do you need? Obviously some better theming and, perhaps, a tad of nuance wouldn't go amiss, but it's just not that kind of film really and that's perfectly fine. Even if it doesn't impact you as much as some of the year's best, it'll certainly make you smile and keep you entertained for a couple of hours. Besides, its inciting incident is driven purely by character and it even manages to squeeze some genuine emotional connection, via a well-drawn dynamic between DeVito and Glover, into its otherwise otherworldly proceedings. Its acting is also deceptively simple but decidedly fantastic, fully immersing you in the idea that these major stars are actually four teenagers and two old men. Basically, it's not as simple as you might think. 7/10"
Jumanji: The Next Level,09-Dec-19,"To be honest, I don't have high expectation for the sequel but turns out it is exceeded all of my expectations.Jumanji: The Next Level added new character, skills, and jokes for all of us. I could hear the audiences in the cinema laugh on the jokes and enjoy it as much as my boyfriend and I enjoyed it. Yeah, I have to admit there were some repeated patterns from the first one but along the way they also added several stuffs which brought fresh air to the whole movie.Also, I think the sequel conveyed deeper messages than the first one, potrayed by the characters problem in it, in which we can related to our real life. Lesson I got from this sequel: Sometimes you will hit the end but it doesn't mean it is over. It means, all you have to do is living the present and look it with different perspectives.From the plot of the story, it kinds of light and predictable, but hey, it is a decent sequel you can enjoy with your family. Side notes: They had after credits scene, it might hints about the potential third movie of Jumanji."
Jumanji: The Next Level,05-Dec-19,"I thought the last Jumanji movie was pretty decent, not perfect, but definitely not bad. If you liked that one you will like this. It is very much just more of the same. If it ain't broke, you know.A couple new faces, one of them I really liked seeing. Won't say who it was, but if you're older than 20, chances are good you like the person.The action is like last time, it's entertaining, but not mind blowing. The effects are overall good. The Rock has some, lets call them punching scenes, which I liked. Although the action direction overall, could have been slightly better, tighter.They once again have fun with the fact that the characters ""in game"" represent characters in the movies ""real life"". And I am pretty impressed with how the actors fared. Maybe especially Dwayne Johnson. (I think he's taking some serious acting classes, he's getting better) Overall the cast in this is very likeable.I didn't feel quite that much that I was in a video game, this time around though. Felt more like just an adventure, than an adventure videogame. They could have hammered home a little better.
So yeah, I was entertained, but it's pretty shallow and won't stick with me like, say, the origianl Jumanji. (I watched that as a kid, and it was kind of revolutionary, so of course it stuck) Nice family flick."
Jumanji: The Next Level,09-Dec-19,"This was a fun time. The cast and performances are both very good here. It's a fun popcorn movie - although, there are some ""shocks"" and somewhat violent deaths throughout which I found jarring and a strange tone choice. However, this is a great bunch of likable comedy actors/young actors being given the freedom to have fun in these roles. There are also some exciting set-pieces and creative vfx. It was a wise choice to bring back the entire cast too, with some new additions. I'd recommend this movie to anyone that wants to see a fun action-packed video game/blockbuster with likable and entertaining actors. But beware of the jump scares and ""scary"" animals if you're sensitive to that sort of thing."
Jumanji: The Next Level,21-Dec-19,"There was no reason to have the characters sound like Danny Devito or Danny Glover when the enter Jumanji.
It made the movie less funny and the switch back to proper characters takes too long.
Was hoping for much better"
Jumanji: The Next Level,08-Dec-19,I absolutely loved the first instalment and to a large extent those that enjoyed the first will enjoy this it's still entertaining fast paced and humerous. The only thing I found was rather than laughing out loud and being on the edge of my seat like the first I had the occasional chuckle sat back. Having said that laughing out loud or not I was never bored and still had a smile on my face for the majority of the film. A decent sequel exiting at in interesting point for a potential 3rd movie.
Jumanji: The Next Level,08-Dec-19,"Surprised that this movie was good. Comparable to the first. The plot was the exact same thing as the first, but by adding new characters and switching up who's in who's body, it kept things fun and entertaining. Very funny, Kevin Hart was hysterical acting like Danny Glover, one of the highlights of the film. Unlike the first, this one had some good fight scene, and a few nice twists. Overall, just a fun entertaining movie. It doesn't stand above the first from 2017, not better not worse. If you didn't like the first, highly doubt you'll enjoy this one any more. But it's still funny for those entertained by the first."
Jumanji: The Next Level,07-Dec-19,"There are not many franchises which have been renewed recently which I have actually thought turned out well. Most have been done badly but I have to say that Jumanji stands out as an exception.This movie does not have a heavy deep story, doesnt try to be anything more than it is, this movie makes you laugh, keeps you entertained and ensures you leave the theater feeling happier than you went in.It wont win oscars but it will win your heart, definitely a movie to go and enjoy at this time of year."
Jumanji: The Next Level,07-Dec-19,"I can't see how this movie was boring. You got the humor, the action, the excitement, the ACTING?! (and that ending tho...) This really was taken to the next level compared to the fist one. But that doesn't necessarily mean it's better. I don't know which I like better. The 2017 version is like the ""standard"" version of Jumanji introducing us to an amazing cast and filled with laughs. This movie builds on that concept and takes it further with a more diverse plot and new characters.
What I DID find dissapointing was that I felt that the fight with the villain was too short and over. But darn this movie was so FUNNY. I came out of the cinema with my stomach hurting because I laughed so much."
Jumanji: The Next Level,13-Jan-20,I expect better scenario.First and Last one are pretty similar.First one much better.
Jumanji: The Next Level,06-Dec-19,"The second film is way funnier than the first one. I thought by the first film that they could up the pace of the film to make it more exciting. This film had the right pace and it kept me excited for the whole film.
And I love the addition of Danny DeVito!"
Jumanji: The Next Level,08-Dec-19,Took the wife and kids to see this and thought it was really funny and great for all ages. The rock and kevin hart just bounce off of each other and made the wife laugh more than me and a nice touch with danny devito and danny glover. My 8 year old thought it was better than the last and cant wait for the next film. Go take the family to see this and enjoy the ride
Jumanji: The Next Level,14-Dec-19,It didn't need Danny Devito or Glovers characters in it. Their characters inept way of understanding what was going on got old.
Jumanji: The Next Level,15-Dec-19,It is not so impressive as previous one. Character transformation is some way working not for all. Only Eddie's turn into Rock is highlighted part. Movie lost charm when Spencer back in Rock. Then story remains nothing. However funny dialogues surely will entertain you. Otherwise rest of movie is bore. I think previous one was better an interesting.
Jumanji: The Next Level,07-Dec-19,"Never knew a sequel was in the making & didn't think the first film needed one. But either way when I heard this was in the works I just had to see it!The film basically picks up after the events of the first & once again the 4 friends & a few family members get thrust back into the game. There entails more adventures of action packed thrills galore!I found the film to be pretty good, not as good as the first, but it was alright. It wasn't PC or Propaganda originated that's for sure. But saying that I did pick up on at least 2 things which may have been a little PC or Propaganda, but I don't know for sure...Overall a great action packed film with epic visuals. Plenty of eye-candy for us guys, Karen Gillian especially! Even that scene in which the characters swap bodies... you'll know what I mean when you watch!8/10"
Jumanji: The Next Level,13-Dec-19,"I really enjoyed the first movie but this one, not so much. The jokes seemed forced and not particularly funny. Even Dwayne Johnson's smouldering look wasn't funny this time around. At least Karen still looked beautiful as ever"
Jumanji: The Next Level,05-Dec-19,It has better action sequence n feels like a video games level design.
Jumanji: The Next Level,04-Dec-19,Very slow story telling and not as good as 2017 version
Jumanji: The Next Level,06-Dec-19,"Jumanji: The Next Level was much better than I expected, I wouldn't say it's better than the first one but it's just as good! Laughed more in this one, and the acting was absolutely amazing! They did a great job on that!Remember to see after the credits scene! There's gonna be a third one :p I hope."
Jumanji: The Next Level,08-Dec-19,"I just love it when a crew manages to keep the bar high in a sequel. They didn't let it go to their heads (writers) and just made what would be level 2 in a game and nothing more. The new characters added a lot of value to the movie. Not only because Glover and DeVito's story is touching and believable (in the very short time it's being told), but the actors (the game avatars) nailed channeling DeVito and Glover. Kevin Hart stole the show as Danny Glover's avatar, but the others were impressive too. The Rock and Awkwafina did an amazing job acting like DeVito.
Anyway, it was fun. Go watch it. Good quality adventure movies are hard to find these days."
Jumanji: The Next Level,06-Dec-19,"BEFORE WATCH, JUST REWATCH THE 1ST MOVIE FIRSTStoryline : great, funny and very entertaining but if you already watch the first movie then I suggest you must rewatch it first to remember it, if not maybe you will get a bit confuse.
Effect : great"
Jumanji: The Next Level,10-Dec-19,"The Rock gives the best performance of Danny DeVito's career. Also, Chekhov's Gun shall hencforth be referred to as Chekhov's Nunchucks.What? You need more than that? Fine....Jumanji : The Next Level is a direct sequel to the 2017 Jumanji : Welcome to the Jungle which was a soft reboot of the 1995 film Jumanji.Spencer, the lead from the previous film is having a hard time at college and finds himself back in the video game Jumanji. However things don't go as planned and his friends have to jump back into the game to rescue him. This time the game also sucks in Spencer's grandfather, played by Danny DeVito and his old business partner Danny Glover (in the best role he's had in well over a decade).This time however, the players don't get to choose thier characters and this creates an interesting fish-out-of-water situation that the film employs to it's absolute best use. Moreover, the dual roles pull some surprisingly good impressions from our main video game cast and showcases a range you might not expect from stars like Dwayne Johnson or Terry Crews.Jumanji has a tricky line to walk. Adventure/Comedy is a tough sell, yet Jumanji manages to craft a rollicking good adventure with action and peril, while never completely abandoning the humor. There are of course a fair amount of cheap shots and pratfalls,
the movie does feature Jack Black after all. However there's a lot of smart jokes, and humor that doesn't rely on the lowest common denominator. It's exactly the kind of comedy that I love and it never lets up.Throughout the film, there's a lot of heart, exploring interpersonal relationships against the backdrop of the adventure and ends with a genuine punch the air moment. The film is unfettered by politics and agendas and may actually be the most fun I've had at the movies this year."
The Hunt,19-May-20,"This movie is an equal opportunity offender and it's hilarious. It pokes fun at everyone and says ""don't worry you can laugh, even if it's at your own expense"".I think the controversy around it makes it even funnier because I didn't find anything to be offended about in this movie because it's a satire, it's saying things with a wink and making fun of the characters saying these things. (I think anyway).Betty Gilpin is great in this and she really knew what movie she was in.It also has a way of keeping you on your toes especially at the start and was kind of refreshing."
The Hunt,14-May-20,"It took me a while to watch this based on reviews and all the political nonsense, but I am so happy I changed my mind. One of the most entertaining movies I've seen in the last year. While there are political undertones and references, they're not over played and it adds to the entertainment. I highly recommend this movie. It's good for some laughs, and isn't light on the action."
The Hunt,09-May-20,I went in thinking I'd hate this movie but turned out loving it. The lead character is well written and Betty Gilpin pulls her off amazingly. Never saw this actress in anything before but will try and find her other movies.
The Hunt,21-Mar-20,"Much more enjoyable than expected.The beginning of it is funny enough, but it is the ensuing few scenes which are riotously HILARIOUS and make it worth watching- I literally laughed until I cried.Toward the middle of the film, there is a wide gap where the laugh-out-loud moments are slowed and further and further apart, but still bring a smile or giggle here and there. The ending while good, is overshadowed by a preceding fight scene that is one for the books. It was really, really well done.The best part of the entire movie though, and what makes it stand out, is that if a person watching has more than two brain cells, the dialogue is spot-on close-to-perfect in mocking BOTH SIDES of the political divide. And here, is what I think people are missing: NEITHER side is depicted as being 'better' than the other. Or worse. It has fun at the expense of everyone and it doesn't do it in any overtly mean way, but in a way where we can nod and nod and nod and laugh ... at ourselves ... no matter who we are or where we stand.Lastly, a horror film - it is not. Somewhat gory, yes. A ""horror"" film? no.7.6/10"
The Hunt,05-May-20,"Major spoilers alert.This film is great escapist fun that also satirizes the our bizarrely extreme cultural divide. It is refreshing to be able to bring gonzo humor and over the top gore as a way to step back from the mindless anger and group think. On top of that, Betty Gilpin's brilliantly played Crystal Creasy is something unique to film. While ostensibly written as a familiar Mary Sue able to kick any ass and beat down any threat, Crystal is a sardonic participant in a mad mad world. Highly intelligent yet without affectations, she really does not give a damn why everyone is trying to kill her. She is also the one character in the movie who does not comfortably fit into the extreme left or right stereotypes in spite of all the superficial appearances to the contrary.I also credit the writers Nick Cuse and Damon Lindelof for being willing to subversively skewer their own. Their sharpest barbs are reserved for their fellow Elites while the Deplorables are mostly just one dimensional cartoonish characters rarely provided with more depth than the aptly hilariously named Yoga Pants or Shut Up Gary.On the other hand, the elite hunters characters are fleshed out with many little details and conceits familiar to those who travel in similar circles. Athena babbles on tritely and unoriginally about the singular importance of cutting tomatoes with a bread knife and using Gruyere in her grilled cheese sandwich speech which takes place in the mansion she keeps insisting is NOT A MANOR! She and her compatriots toss off Animal Farm Snowball references as a sort of intellectual adornment, insult, and shibboleth while revealing that they understand next to nothing about a book they were probably once forced to read in some boring English class.The film's conflict originates with one of the Elite characters being found out sleeping with his wife's oncologist which leads to his dismissal from his charitable foundation. Another talks about his dubious devotion to a peasant lover he has inconveniently knocked up. They all look down on the hired hand Sargent Dale who is only allowed the smallest modicum of respect for having a small part in the Bruce Willis movie Tears of the Sun - ""why is the sun crying?"". Even the choice of having the action set in Croatia in something of a inside joke as that has recently been a preferred destination for the fashionable set seeking to avoid the common company of the hoi polloi.The movie starts with a turtle and ends with a hare mirroring the awesomely twisted and violent bedtime story that Crystal says her mother used to tell her. That story serves as a sort of explanation of her uniquely detached outlook and her singular ability to spot deadly threats based on the smallest of tells.At the film's conclusion, Crystal echos the story arc of the Napoleon Animal Farm character. She transforms from her deplorable self by donning Athena's signature red bottomed stiletto pumps, slipping into her stylish black dress, commandeering her plane, while tossing back Athena's prized champagne and caviar.Why it's a Cinderella story!Highly recommended if you have a sense of humor and can enjoy a stupid fun movie."
The Hunt,04-Apr-20,"The movie starts Great, twelve strangers are kidnapped and then hunted by a group of rich people, simple plot, normal acting, fast paced, unpredictable, funny and fun. All in the first exciting 15 mins.Then all of a sudden nearly by the middle of the movie it slows down...gets redundant, annoying and very predictable by the over used dull yet unrealistic hero character type, the type that knows it all, never fails and will accomplish anything. Beside the fact that it was falsely classified as horror and it has nothing to do with this genre! The dramatic plot is ridiculously idiotic, the reason why behind the film is completely unbelievable and unrealistic, the fighting scenes were lame as they lack any logic or credibility due to the hero never fails concept. Not to mention, the extremely stupid and predictable ending which was spotted a mile ahead.Sadly this is a vivid example of a Great chance for a change and a feature that could've been unique which sadly turned into a wasted time and bad experience caused by all the wrong choices made by the filmmakers."
The Hunt,12-Apr-20,"Just a good well done movie. Funny and in some ways unpredictable. One minute you think someone is the main star next minute gone(blown up,head blown off or blown away with a shot gun!"
The Hunt,30-Mar-20,"This leans much more towards satire and black comedy style of horror.
Quite surprisingly good! A battle royale between the ""elites"" vs the ""deplorables"". I really liked how the filmmakers played around with the concepts of our current political zeitgeist, and its a lot of fun to see how they play with it, and provide a satiric commentary in the movie, targeting both sides. Both sides take hits, and also learn they have misconceptions about the other, and gain a newfound respect for their ""enemy"". A rare horror gem with wit, satire, smarts, and fun at the same time. The ending I absolutely loved, and thought it was exactly how it should have been."
The Hunt,23-Mar-20,I'm not sure all the people that gave bad reviews even seen this movie or they are just plain miserable. Some have just read too much into it. It's a fun dark humoured movie with a bit of gore that doesn't take itself seriously. You moaners need to get a life and not realise that not every movie has to be analised to see if its black/white or red/blue or rainbow. Enjoy it for what it is. FUN. If not then watch The Waltons on a loop.
The Hunt,26-Mar-20,"Based on the 6.4/10, I wasn't expecting this to be better than Invisible Man, but I couldn't have been more wrong. The movie is very funny and Deep Blue Sea-esk in that a few well-knowns are the first to go. Betty Gilpin's expressions set this satire-gore-story apart from them all."
The Hunt,14-Mar-20,"Take a hint, my title is satirical, as was this film. Anyone finding the need to pick a political side from this film needs to give their heads a shake. This was pure mindless entertainment, and writers Nick Cuse and Damon Lindelof nailed it! I want/ed more! Directing by Craig Zobel was excellent. Casting was perfect, and both Gilpin and Swank delivered. Despite the awesome violence and gore, in the end, it's just a feel-good movie, comedic in nature, as one bad guy after another gets what everyone in the audience thinks they deserved. The critics got this one wrong - they either took it too politically, or had their neck-ties on too tight. A definite recommend from me, and a well deserved 9/10!"
The Hunt,23-Apr-20,"I thought the movie was great. Original and humorous. And while political stances were used to set up the plot and some of the humor, I think that's all it was. I didn't see any political message or anything so I suggest just giving it a try even if you are sensitive to such things. The one argument I can understand against this movie is about it's classification. Those looking for a strict Action, Horror, Thriller might be disappointed to see it's unserious and humorous nature. I would describe the nature similar to The Cabin in the Woods if you've seen that."
The Hunt,11-Mar-20,"It had similar vibes of Ready Or Not, ideas and themes of The Purge and the unpredictability of The Cabin In The Woods.
The first act is pretty strong and it really throws you off course as to who you think the main protagonist will be. That just set me up nicely for not having a clue of where it could go next.
It moves at a good pace, the violence is brutal but cartoonish in its execution, the gags are solid and go down brave but potentially dangerous routes. I was fine with them. But it wouldn't surprise if some might offend the SJW cinema-goers.
While the end was the most formulaic part of the film. The journey getting there made it a worthwhile watch."
The Hunt,20-Mar-20,"This movie was written to basically call everyone an idiot if they base their whole lives around politically based ideological garbage. It's saying that regardless of being far right or far left you're still basically the same breed of moron and that it's the people living in the middle, who are actually trudging away just living our lives, are the actual badasses. Well not me specifically, but the general ""we"". The people who ignore the extremes of politics and just get things done. This movie portrays that in the least subtle way possible and I thought it was pretty hilarious.There is almost no plot to this movie, which I'm sure will turn people off, but that's honestly what I liked about it because as commentary it speaks to political discourse that we see every day. It's all crap on both sides. Just buzz words and stupid conspiracy theories with both sides trying to paint each other into a box with very specific ideologies. Then we have the protagonist, a woman we know nothing about, nothing is ever explained about her, and she just takes over everything. It's all a very hamfisted analogy for modern society but I thought it was hilarious.The plot is dumb, the characters are disposable, you never know what's going to happen next, everyone is insulted by the end, and Betty Gilpin does a hilarious job of just being bizarre. She also shows off some of her skills she's developed from starring on GLOW and her body is crazy tight in this. This is overall just a silly, ridiculous, popcorn flick with gratuitous violence...which is exactly what we need in an overly charged political era. It's a 6 because it's no masterpiece or anything, but it's plenty enjoyable."
The Hunt,12-May-20,"The movie has non stop action and entertainment from start to stop. The storyline and plot is great. And for the ones giving bad reviews due to the fact, that the license plate and other stuff is wrong, or takes it too serious, get a life.
It's a dark humor movie with a twist of gore, with the purpose of entertaining, which it does!. And with Betty Gilpin and Hilary Swank, it doesnt get much hotter to watch. And it also comes with one hell of a girl fight. I highly recommend this movies."
The Hunt,29-Mar-20,"This movie strikes right into our educated, full of reason, polarized minds - which we all have. And it's funny. Just don't miss it"
The Hunt,26-Mar-20,"This movie was great! I went in not expecting too much, and preparing myself for a political ""preaching to"". I was soooooo pleasantly disappointed. This movie was non-stop shocks and fun from start to finish. Politically, it takes very clever and hilarious shots at both sides of the political spectrum. I really expected it to be slanted to one side, which I worried would annoy me; it didn't. It was tons of fun. No matter your political affiliation, if you can't take a joke aimed at being either a liberal or a conservative, this movie is not for you. However, if you don't mind EXTREMELY clever jokes made at the expense of both sides, then you'll love this movie."
The Hunt,13-Mar-20,"Oh boy this is fun.""The Hunt"" had preview screenings tonight, and I am SO glad I went to one. I have not been this entertained by a movie in a long time.Originally scheduled for release late last year, due to media spin about a movie most of the complainers hadn't seen, Blumhouse Productions delayed the release, while they waged a quiet counter-campaign.They were right, to do so. This movie IS NOT what the hue-and-cry suggested it is. To be sure, ""The Hunt""is about political leftists hunting political conservatives (aka: ""Deplorables"") for sport, but this is satire; tightly scripted, brilliantly executed, and with every trace of polemics themselves lampooned for dark...very dark...laughs.""The Hunt"" is above all funny. If you have the sense of humor for it. It is also grisly; filled with flying body parts and graphic violence worthy of the horror movies Blumhouse is rapidly becoming famous for. But all of that is in service to political satire from which no point on the spectrum escapes unsoiled.Best of all is the direction. Delightful twist follows carefully delivered surprise again and again. And just when I though I had the algorithm figured out, Director Craig Zobel gently pulls the rug, and I laugh at myself for thinking I could anticipate any of it.""The Hunt"" is rated ""R"", and it earns it. As I said, the violence is graphic and real. The language is as legitimate as angry people arguing for their lives, and their beliefs.I would not say that the movie gains any special benefit from being seen in a theater, but I have a feeling this film is going to be a HUGE hit, and if you wait for a home release, you may experience people spoiling it for you. At the very least, you will be an outsider, listening to people rave about ""The Hunt"".I give it nine stars.Nine very shiny stars."
The Hunt,23-Mar-20,"This is bloody, and bloody funny, and whip smart.
Dang why all the snowflakery, ? Both sides are made fun of so just sit back and be entertained.
Betty Gilpin ROCKS this movie and Swank is stellar (is she anything else ?)
Great fun, it must have been a blast to make."
The Hunt,20-Mar-20,"At last a movie where the main plot isnt force fed ""wokism"".. at last a movie where conservatives aren't antagonist.. I am fed up watching liberal propaganda.. dont get me wrong I am all for human rights, gender rights, women rights, environmental protection etc.. all human being have rights to exist with honor and dignity as long as their activities dont harm other human beings.. but for the last decade most blockbuster movies were force fed liberal propaganda.. This movie changed that.. enjoyed it.. Specially during these times of self isolation because of corona-virus outbreak.. Stay safe all.."
The Hunt,20-Mar-20,"How interesting that so much controversy would be generated by a film an inherently, and deliberately, silly as this one.A group seemingly unconnected Americans, of various ages and genders, awake to find themselves on a strange compound with the only clue to their situation being a large crate nearby. The crate contains a variety of weapons. Once armed, the people are then picked off by an unseen enemy.I don't know why I'm being so coy in my synopsis, as you'll know from any of the advertising that the film is about ""liberal elites"" hunting ""deplorables"". What you won't get is the tone of the film, which is pretty much a comedy. A black comedy at times admittedly, but occasionally just an out and out comedy. The film I'd most compare it too is ""Cabin in The Woods"" - as it takes a similarly well worn premise and manages to do some different and new things with it. However, ""The Hunt"" doesn't have ""Cabin's"" rewatchability. Once you know the plot, I can't really see another reason to come back to it.I'd also say, the trailer for the film really does the movie a disservice, as it gives away a couple of the films secrets, including revealing who the lead ""Liberal"" is played by - which the movie goes to great lengths to keep concealed. The deaths are nicely done though, and often come out of nowhere, with a wonderful practical feel to the effects and it's a funny film, occasionally laugh out loud so. Betty Gilphin is great, as ever, in this.The controversy that'd dogged the film seems pretty silly once you've seen it. - although the advertising has played into it too - so they only have themselves to blame. I felt the film not only attacks both sides in equal measure but has an overall message of once you scratch the surface there being more that unites us than divides us.It's a solid, entertaining film - just not one with much replay value."
The Hunt,23-Mar-20,"I can't believe the hate, great action flick. The film swerved into Some interesting themes and pokes fun at all sides of the political spectrum. It's an edge of your seat wild ride. Not an amazing work of are but supremely entertaining."
The Hunt,23-Mar-20,"This is undoubtedly, one of the greatest movies I've ever watched. Didn't see the trailer,just read the announcement and saw the poster. I knew it would be great after just 5 minutes.
The script, the jokes, the hidden messages and peculiar play. This is brilliant. The script writer is a genius.
I will admit, this is not for everyone and I am not sure who this movie is for, probably for someone who can think, perhaps?? There's so much behind each dialog!!!
I don't want to spoil it. This is definitely a comedy-horror(ish gore)-thriller-action type flick. If you are into that sort of stuff, there's a good chance you will enjoy it. I can see myself re watching it again in a couple of years. The last Star Wars, which I watched recently was horrible and boring and I wasn't sure if anything can redeem my fate of movies and this one really did.10/10. Best movie of the year for me!"
The Hunt,21-Mar-20,"I know that none of the bad reviewers even watched this movie. It's not really a left or right movie but it shows how bad both of those sides are and the hero actually seems to be like most of us, somewhere in the middle. I hope people will give it a watch before passing judgment on it."
The Hunt,29-Mar-20,"I'm not sure a film has ever had to traverse a rockier road to get to audiences than ""The Hunt"". Scheduled to hit the cinema in late-summer of 2019, it was pushed back due to its subject matter supposedly clashing with a number of political/social events at the time (almost a bit ironic considered the film's overall message). Then, after finally getting a March 2020 release date, a pandemic hits and shuts down all theaters, forcing the movie to be released digital-only. Throughout that winding road to viewers, ""The Hunt"" gained a negative reputation as subversive or dangerous in politically-charged ways, as well as featuring a satirical tone that is potentially off-putting to those either unwilling or unable to look beyond its surface level. While I would 100% agree that a film like ""The Hunt"" doesn't tackle political/social matters in a way movie viewers are used to, it does provide an interesting treatise on the current social landscape through the lens of political stereotypes and biases.For a very basic overview, ""The Hunt"" sees 12 strangers suddenly and inexplicably thrown together out in the middle of nowhere. The initial confusion quickly switches to terror, however, when they realize they are being hunted (presumably for sport) by others. Through a series of conversations and flashbacks, viewers learn that the hunters are your stereotypical ""liberal elites"", while the hunted are the ""conservative, red state"" types. But are things really that simple?The thing I would stress most to anyone watching ""The Hunt"" is to always remember that it is satire at heart. There are groan-inducing wisecracks as people are blown to bits, and cringe-worthy lines of dialogue abound. But that doesn't make ""The Hunt"" a bad movie! I wonder if perhaps the satire genre is a bit of a lost art form in that people now expect movies about social/political themes to be life-or-death serious. I'm as big of a ""heavy drama"" fan as anyone, but that isn't the only way to tackle those subjects. Here, the model is to set up a basic Blumhouse Productions film strategy (i.e. slightly ridiculous but able to appeal to younger audiences). If made as a sweeping, serious epic, right away more than half the audience base would be cut out from under it.Of course, the above characterization is only this film's surface-level description. Embedded deep within the Damon Lindelof and Nick Cuse-penned script is a surprisingly deft characterization of the current sociopolitical landscape. While at first ""The Hunt"" comically leans into stereotypes, it then deconstructs them and ultimately turns into a compelling treatise on how ""both sides of the aisle"" share the same common problems. One just has to look past the surface-level buffoonery to get there.Perhaps the biggest criticism levied against ""The Hunt"" has been that it simply panders to political stereotypes. In my viewing, that couldn't be further from the truth--again, as long as one realizes the tone is comic/satirical in nature. For all the world this film seems like an exercise in ridiculousness, but there's a reason the pig pictured prominently in the film's marketing is named Orwell.Overall, ""The Hunt"" is a brilliant social/political skewering camouflaged as a cheesy, over-the-top action/thriller. It isn't shallow, by any means, nor is it overly pompous. In these ""all or nothing"" political times, however, it may be odd or perplexing to some to see the issues chuckled at rather than the gnashing of teeth. If you can get past or embrace the satire, however, there are spot-on messages here that will/should make both conservatives and liberals stop and think a bit."
The Wolf of Wall Street,23-Feb-20,"This film is every definition of the word ""impeccable."" Scorcese's fantastic storytelling ability mixed with phenomenal acting from DiCaprio, Hill and the rest of the cast makes for an awesome combination. The film is never boring and gives you a glimpse into the life of a man who had everything in the world only to have it taken away."
The Wolf of Wall Street,24-Dec-13,"In the mid-1990s, Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) and the rest of his associates from brokerage firm Stratton Oakmont became the very definition of excess and debauchery, their offices a boiler room fueled by cocaine and greed. High pressure sales tactic and less-than-legal behind-the-scenes manipulation bred plenty of twenty-something millionaires, and Belfort built himself an empire at the top of the heap. His rise and fall is chronicled in The Wolf of Wall Street, based on the memoir of the same name.Under most circumstances, the actions of Belfort and his cronies (including Jonah Hill in a howlingly funny turn as Belfort's business partner) would be viewed as disgustingly abhorrent, but Martin Scorsese frames this tale of greed with a comedic lens that allows us to laugh at things we probably shouldn't find humorous. Whether it's a clumsy attempt at fisticuffs between two characters overdosing on Quaaludes, or the categorization of prostitutes using stock market terminology (""blue chip"" hookers make you wear a condom and typically accept credit cards), the film is outrageous from start to finish, and rarely falters in its quest to entertain the audience for three hours.Belfort manages to delude himself and his pals into thinking they can live like this forever, but the audience knows better, and Belfort's eventual comeuppance is hardly surprising. But the path is paved with hilarity, especially in a scene aboard the mogul's luxury yacht, where he surreptitiously offers a pair of FBI agents everything from booze to girls to cold hard cash in exchange for their silence. And let's not forget his punishment for drunkenly piloting a helicopter into the backyard of his estate at 3am, raising the ire of his trophy wife (Margot Robbie).Scorsese has always managed to elicit astounding performances from his actors, and his fifth collaboration with Leonardo DiCaprio results in one of the most charismatic, despicable, offensive and captivating characters to ever appear on screen. As financial bad boy Belfort, DiCaprio swaggers from scene to scene ingesting eye-popping amounts of narcotics, groping and fondling nearly every female within reach, and spouting more profanity in three hours than an entire season of The Sopranos. Belfort is the kind of person that any sane person would detest in real life, but thanks to Scorses and DiCaprio, we can't take our eyes off him.-- Brent Hankins, www.nerdrep.com"
The Wolf of Wall Street,24-Oct-18,"It's no surprise that Scorsese is associated with the gangster genre with films such as The Departed, Goodfellas and Casino, of which the last two are possibly the best pure examples of the genre. In Goodfellas the gangsters are dangerous but they operate on a more underground level, in Casino they practically run a major city and can do whatever they like. The gangsters were and will always be a part in America's system. Now, the gangsters are not just accepted by the system, but are considered to be an integral part of it. In the first two films, the gangster is threatening and dangerous, but avoidable. In The Wolf of Wall Street, he's calling to hustle you at home and you don't even know it. Some people view The Wolf of Wall Street as a glorification of Jordan Belfort's lifestyle and want to be like him, as Scorsese portrays this life by its nature, enticing. That's the way it works, and it's impossible to portray it accurately without showing how a charismatic man like Belfort can suck an unsuspecting person into a world of money and fame. The film though, shows us just how empty and destructive that life can be.There is an undeniable similarity between the instantaneous joy, energy and euphoria that we have while watching The Wolf of Wall Street and how Jordan Belfort lives his life, this is a movie where the director skillfully mixes form and content to create an experience which is as hyper and as instantly ecstatic as the life of its flashy and opportunistic characters.The direction by Martin Scorsese which still has infectious energy and power is impeccable, there is no other director who has mastered pacing like he has. This is a three-hour movie that moves lightning fast and always manages to keep the audience invested in the story throughout the whole duration. Each scene is packed with so much visual information, and it is fast paced and quickly edited, which complements the general tone of the film. The cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto is gorgeous as well and displays an optimal color palette throughout the whole film. Each shot also looks precise, even during some of the more chaotic scenes.The script is fantastic, filled with many great and memorable lines of dialogue. Every character has a well-defined arc and motives, and the story is given proper breathing room to blossom. The performances are also exquisite, especially Leonardo DiCaprio who gives one of the best performances of his career and portrays the opportunistic nature of Jordan Belfort's character with great commitment as you can see a lustful, hedonistic and impulsive sex & drug-addict man who only wants to have more fun. Supporting him with equal passion is Jonah Hill as Donnie Azoff, Belfort's sidekick, and even he manages to make a mark of his own. Margot Robbie plays Naomi, Belfort's second wife and she does an alluring job in her given role. Matthew McConaughey is in for a very short duration as Mark Hanna, Belfort's mentor, but even in that little time, he is the show-stealer and he dominates the screen unlike anyone else.Martin Scorsese and Terence Winter set out to create a film about the Wall Street excess, and by definition, it contains an excessive amount of everything, such as cursing, sex, nudity, drugs, alcohol and partying. But the film is not really about those things. The story of The Wolf of Wall Street boils down to money, that ""most-addictive drug"" Belfort speaks of, and not just what it can buy, but what it can do to people. Not just how it changes one's lifestyle but the effects it has on one's morals, beliefs, and values, and how it can effectively change not just how a person thinks and feels but how they operate at their core.With a collection of truly incredible films, The Wolf of Wall Street stands out as one of Scorsese's best films, my personal favorite and by far his most humorous film to date. He truly went all out and it paid off in a hilarious satire on the reverence of money, drugs, women, and the admiration of a criminal money-maker. The Wolf of Wall Street is maddening cinema that's already high on coke but still continues to snort more white powder every 5 minutes for 3 hours. This is a fascinating vignette of excess, greed, abuse and decay and it's one of the best movies of the decade and surely one of the most entertaining movies ever made."
The Wolf of Wall Street,17-Jan-14,"This film arrived in the UK with awards and Oscar nominations all around it, adding an expectation which it really didn't need adding since even without any of that it is ultimately a Scorsese film with a big name cast. It also arrives with some other stuff because the film has been criticized for near glamorization of the excesses that Belfort was able to experience with his ill-gotten funds and, to be honest, it is an impression that isn't helped when you consider that this film was put forward to the Golden Globes in the Musical/Comedy section. Now I am sure that was a political move by the studio, but it does say something about the film because indeed for most of it we have stuff so unbelievable and so excessive that it is hard not to laugh at it. It is hard not to enjoy it.And this is a problem, because the first 2 hours and a bit of this film is really engaging and enchanting in how much of a rush it gives you, how enticing it is and just how much vibrant energy it all has. The viewer is swept along and I guess to a point this is the film doing its job well because not only are we being told a story but we are first hand seeing how easy it is to get caught up in the grab for success, for money, for status. In this regard the film works really well because throughout the film I really was glad to be part of it and wanted it for myself; I don't think the film goes out of its way to glamorize this excess and this life, but for sure it doesn't do much to balance it – and this really is my problem with the film.The structure, subjects and delivery of this film is so inherently similar to Goodfellas that it is hard not to mention it. If you remember the opening of Goodfellas you'll remember that it opens with a memorably violent scene where an near-dead man in the back of a car is stabbed by Hill and his colleagues in a scene that is oppressive and violent but yet ends with the narration telling us ""as far back as I can remember I wanted to be a gangster"" and snaps to credits under a big track from Tony Bennett. This scene is important because it works as a microcosm of the whole film – the appeal but also the cost, all in one place. Wolf of Wall Street never has any of that and it hurts it. I suspect the message of the film is that our financial systems are screwed and that ultimately the rich will never be in the same world as the average person, because this is what I took from the rather sobering final scenes. However if this is the point it is trying to make then it really hurts itself with the rest of the film seeming to say ""so why not get on board"". I know this is not the case but the lack of a ""point"" or an agenda it the film means that it naturally fills it with its own, which is a weird feeling.But then again – I guess it is a comedy. So the infamous Quaalude scene is not horrific but rather hilarious, the scenes of excess and of criminality are not equally appealing and repulsive – they are almost totally appealing, we hardly get the other side or get to see a victim here, and a few seconds on the subway with the FBI agent really does nothing but yet again make the suggestion that ""it's all broken so why not at least get rich yourself"". Getting away from this, it is a well made film. Scorsese makes this award season's second film to owe a massive debt to Goodfellas (American Hustle being the other) and he directs the film with energy; music is used well as one would expect and the editing makes the film pop. DiCaprio is great in the lead – OK he doesn't find the heart of the character, but the film doesn't ask him to. Instead he is charismatic and energetic, drawing the viewer in and giving the film its energy. The supporting cast is deep with names and familiar faces and it is a statement about how well the film holds the viewer, because it isn't distracting no matter how many famous faces or supporting character from TV appear (although I did notice that this and American Hustle had lots of faces from HBO's Boardwalk Empire). Jonah Hill is over the top in a way that works, although I am surprised to see him getting an Oscar nomination for it in such a crowded year.Wolf of Wall Street has had a lot of praise and this will continue as the Oscars approach and are awarded. Personally I enjoyed the film as a funny true story delivered with energy and excess but in many ways it is not Goodfellas and the most important of these is that the film lacks a moral core to itself, to its characters and to its message. I don't mind the ""it's all screwed so who cares"" message that it ultimately seems to give, but I didn't feel comfortable with how wide a smile it had on its face while it was delivering it."
The Wolf of Wall Street,17-Dec-13,"Brilliantly acted, superbly written and as one would expect from a picture by Martin Scorsese, it is a masterclass of directorial craft.Showy when it needs to be, but also quiet and contemplative. ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is the equivalent of something like ""Good Fellas"" or even more so ""Casino"" but set in the world of finance. The suits might be more expensive but the people who wear them are just as sick and violent as their street-mob counterparts. Sardonic in humor and unflinching in showing the depravity of its characters, it marks somewhat of a different approach to the world of stock-trading than Oliver Stone's ""Wall Street"".Where Stone seems more in line with Bertold Brecht who considered theater (or in this case film) a moral institution, does Scorsese take the position of the omnipresent observer of the dark side of the American and in many cases the human dream.Leonard DiCaprio gives another stellar performance of great intensity and even greater tragedy while this tale of corruption, greed and self-righteousness unfolds.It's a vast panorama that shows how during the last twenty-five to thirty years gullibility as well as our innate greed make all of us accomplices in this never-ending pyramid scheme far away from any reality.One could almost hear Scorsese's clerical background come to the fore again, according to which nobody is without sin, and therefore we are all susceptible to corruption.It is our decision on which side we choose to live that makes the difference. For every individual but also society as a whole."
The Wolf of Wall Street,17-Dec-13,"Martin Scorsese has done it again. His newest and most refreshing effort he's contributed to the world of cinema in years, The Wolf of Wall Street is a roaring thrill ride that is both absolutely hilarious and meticulously constructed. It also presents Academy Award nominee Leonardo DiCaprio in possibly his finest acting performance of his career. At one-minute shy of three hours, I was both engaged and hypnotized nearly the entire duration. A comedic epic that studies the behavior and cultures of a time in America, feels like the uncovering of a time capsule that was buried and dug up to give insight into our current financial crisis. Much more than just laughs, it turns on the dramatic elements early enough in the film to warrant considerable reactions about the choices of our key characters. Expertly paced with intelligent moral questions presented, The Wolf of Wall Street is one of the best films of the year.Telling the story of Jordan Belfort, a young Wall Street broker that gets involved in drugs, money, and even more drugs during the 80's and 90's. In his tenure trading (and stealing), Jordan marries, divorces, does drugs, marries again, does even more drugs, makes solid friendships, and believe it or not, does a lot more drugs. Watching the destruction of Jordan acted as a documentarian's insight that felt like I was watching ""Intervention"" without the family that cares. The Wolf of Wall Street is a black comedy, giving hints of drama. Natural comparisons will fly to Oliver Stone's Wall Street which is accurate but you can see subtle hints of films like Trading Places, Glengarry Glen Ross, and even American Psycho. That's a testament to Scorsese's outstanding direction and Terence Winter's masterful screenplay. Scorsese keeps Wolf life-size, sprinkled with characters that are both geniuses and morons, but functioning morons. They're like the frat pack group that sat in a corner on my college campus, being loud and obnoxious, and made terrible life choices that they still aren't aware of until this day. Scorsese puts together an all-star cast to inhabit these beings that includes DiCaprio, Jonah Hill, Margot Robbie, Matthew McConaughey, Jon Bernathal, and Kyle Chandler. All of which seem to be having the time of their lives.A lot of the credit of the film's overall success has to be awarded to Leonardo DiCaprio. I've never seen him truly ""go for it"" in a way that he exhibits as Jordan Belfort. In his breaking of the fourth wall, to his long but completely engaging monologues about life, money, and greed, it's the most assured and compelling work by the actor to date. When DiCaprio unleashed his talents in the mid-90's in What's Eating Gilbert Grape? and later stole the hearts of tween girls everywhere in Titanic, who knew this is the role he'd been gearing up to play. This is the role of his career and something that the Academy Awards should look to for his long overdue recognition. It's a charming and adventurous turn that presents a conundrum to the audience as we find ourselves both enamored and loathing the pure essence of Jordan. A sequence of DiCaprio crawling on the floor will probably be the scene of the year. This is DiCaprio's crowning achievement.As the magnetic and cheesy-minded right-hand man, Jonah Hill's performance as Donnie Azoff is another great turn for the 30-year-old actor. He's allowed to explore some of his comedic ticks and beats that he may not have ever had the opportunity to explore in films like Superbad or 21 Jump Street. In Wolf, he relies on his own instincts, and his chemistry with DiCaprio, which has helped him before for his Oscar-nominated work in Moneyball opposite Brad Pitt. Matthew McConaughey, is one scene shy of winning the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. While his work in Dallas Buyers Club will bring him the acclaim and recognition that he deserves, The Wolf of Wall Street is a prime example of what he should be doing when he's not working or seeking out the strong, independent features that are geared for awards recognition. Stealing every frame and focus from DiCaprio in his ten minute screen time, McConaughey utilizes all his charm and spunk as Mark Hanna, the mentor to young Jordan as he started out.Like any great Scorsese film, the women are in full-force and given the opportunity to shine like the others. Cristin Millotti, a toned down and tragic version of Marisa Tomei in My Cousin Vinny, is sensational in her brief appearances on screen. Beautiful and sympathetic, she offers much needed serious and dramatic elements to Jordan's outrageous antics. In the end, a star is born in the gorgeous and vivacious Margot Robbie as Naomi Lapaglia, Jordan's second wife. Whoever was going to be cast as Naomi, had to be an actress of considerable talent and had the ability to really be the sexy kitten but still warrant an emotional reaction from the audience when called upon. Margot Robbie was the perfect choice and she'll need to owe Scorsese royalties for years to come with the roles she'll be offered following this. Robbie is pure magic and is everything she's required to be. She's the more elusive, compelling, and more thought out version of Scarlett Johansson's character in Don Jon.I loved every second of The Wolf of Wall Street. Terence Winter's script is a natural and well-oiled machine that produces the words of a demigod. You couldn't make these things up. Thelma Schoonmaker is the utmost professional and continues to shine film after film. You won't find another dedicated and glossed editing work this year. The other supporting actors do sensational work especially Kyle Chandler, who has a very well-constructed exchange on a boat with DiCaprio, has us asking more and more, why is this guy not helming his own films on a consistent basis yet?"
The Wolf of Wall Street,29-Dec-13,"If you've seen The Goodfellas or Casino, then you'll know the story of The Wolf of Wall Street. This is another tale of a criminal whose ambitions sweep him away into a debauched world of dirty money, out-of-control substance abuse, endless lies, a troubled family life, and a downward spiral of corruption that inevitably leads to his own undoing. Only thing is, this is less about the gangsters and mafia, and more about white-collar crime. The guys wear suits, work in proper offices, and everything they do is just business; funnily enough, this whole movie still plays out like a kind of gangster film.Based on the memoirs of Jordan Belfort - the real-life stock broker who made millions by selling shoddy stocks to average joes - the film showcases one seriously messed-up slimeball of a man. If his scheme sounds familiar, it's because it's been the inspiration behind the 2000 film Boiler Room, and this film covers much of the same concepts, albeit with better structure. The film maintains a close and intimate focus on the man as he rises to power, suckers thousands into his schemes, and then lives a life of extreme excess. And it is extreme: the whole film becomes laden with drugs, sex, superficial luxuries, material things, and characters who want nothing more than to take and consume everything. The sheer corruption becomes palpable on-screen, and I couldn't help but to shake my head at numerous scenes when I saw just how far these wolfish characters have gone in their unrestrained partying and debauchery. I have no clue as to how closely this film adapts the real-life events, but at times it's almost hard to believe that things could have gone this far. And yet, the excesses serve to underscore key themes and criticisms on the American dream; the pursuit of money and success, through any means, remains the main drive of the characters and the movie, and it leads to a fairly hard-hitting downfall.This film features good-looking photography and editing. Acting is great: Leonardo DiCaprio is practically perfect as the titular character, and the rest of the cast pulls their weight really well (including Jonah Hill, who seems to fit into his character's archetype very comfortably). Writing is really sharp and good; the film is full of great lines and great speeches. There are some great-looking sets, props, and costumes on display in this film. Music has a varied mix of songs, and they're all used really well for their intended effect.The Wolf of Wall Street is every bit as good as Martin Scorsese's previous work with The Goodfellas and Casino. All these films work with similar plots and themes, but TWOWS is like a gangster film masked by the thin veil of upper-class corporate swindling. It is a film that candidly shows the crimes and excesses in full, before proving that, even for the super-rich, crime still doesn't pay.Recommended! 4.5/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Very Good | Film: Perfect)"
The Wolf of Wall Street,25-Dec-13,"""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is infectiously entertaining. It is probably the funniest movie I have seen all year with witty dialogue, over the top characters, and filled with energy that bleeds off the screen. Between all the fun however,  there is also a story about addiction and how it can cause a downward spiral in your life whether it be drugs, money, or power.Acclaimed director Martin Scorsese does a wonderful job keeping this movie at a high at all times. Never once does this movie lose it's energy or sense of humor much like the drug induced characters. There are a lot of quick cuts and edits to keep the movie feeling as If you are on drugs as well as playing high energy music in some of the more serious situations.The cast brings their ""A"" game. The stand out is obviously Leonardo DiCaprio, who pretty much owns and excels any scene he is in. This film really showcases his diverse range.Overall ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is a full on adrenaline ride that never loses momentum. It's directed with a lot of flair and energy and has an incredibly well written script that gives it depth and a ton of laughs. The cast is fantastic and DiCaprio gives his best and most fun filled performance to date. I really enjoyed this movie and think it's the funniest movie of the year 4.5/5"
The Wolf of Wall Street,30-Nov-13,"The last few Scorsese pics left me a little disappointed. I had begun to think Marty had become a 'gun for hire' and that his brilliance may have been spent (his earlier works were some of the best movies ever made). I attended a screening of The Wolf of Wall Street this evening, and was expecting to be unimpressed. I am happy to say I was completely blown away. This pic is Marty at his best. I laughed, I cringed, I related (with fond memories as well as a bit of guilt) and I TOTALLY believed every unbelievable moment. A good book, a great screenplay and a delightful cast were formed and molded into what I believe should get Scorsese a best director Oscar, and likely a Best Picture Award for the movie. Leo DiCaprio has grown into a versatile actor and his creation of this super hero dirtbag's roller coaster ride in this crazy (true) story is really honest and delightfully entertaining. Jonah Hill pulled out all the stops too and this is definitely his best work. Thank you Mr. Scorsese for delivering the goods so brilliantly!"
The Wolf of Wall Street,26-Dec-13,"This movie is NOT rated ""R"" but rather ""NC-17"" if not ""X"" rated. I got tired and almost fell asleep a some parts. About half of the movie is nothing more then them drinking, partying, and doing drugs. Literally. Also a bunch of pornography. It's like a college gone crazy for half of the movie (you see like 40+ boobies, a bunch of sex scenes, and a few shorts glimpse of a penis AND vagina)I got so excessive everyone I went with debated on leaving...The humor is not bad and there is a decent amount of it throughout the movie. (7/10) The acting, mainly Leonardo, was fantastic! (9.5/10) The story is a bit shallow. Basically a bunch of people lying, cheating, stealing, and running/escaping on Wall Street and making a lot of ""dirty"" illegal money. Then talking talk and talking bad about other people who are honest but make less. The movie portrays a picture that money is the most important thing and it is what brings you happiness very well. (2/10) Near the end it shows that being controlled by money is very bad, but it wasn't portrayed as well as it did trying to argue for money bringing happiness. It shows a bunch of ""rich"" folks who have nothing but money thinking they're above everyone else. No health, no relationships, no integrity, no manners, no respect, no honesty, no time, nothing but money and the animalistic drive to get more and destroy everything in the way.As a movie it makes the world a depressing place. Overall the main thing I like about the movie is Leonardo Dicaprio. Props to him for continuing to be an awesome actor. The movie content itself was subpar."
The Wolf of Wall Street,30-Dec-13,"By far the Best Movie of the Year, Best Actor, Best Director! The whole supporting cast is excellent as well. This movie will not disappoint it was much better than I expected and the duration of the movie is not felt at all. It definitely did not feel like a 3 hour production. Scorsese put this movie together brilliantly! You are on your toes and engaged throughout from beginning to end. Leonardo DiCaprio is at his best! He will take you through the highs and lows of the movie with an Oscar Winning Performance. I read about Jordan Belfort and it appears that Scorsese and DiCaprio made this movie as accurate as possible which I really appreciate. I commend Scorsese and DiCaprio for keeping this epic picture as authentic as possible. After all this is Hollywood."
The Wolf of Wall Street,02-Jan-14,"It's hard to find the words to explain how TRULY AWFUL this film is. I'll try to do a list:1) There's no context: They never show the victims of the fraud. We see the sales effort but not the people they're selling to. How can you do a movie about people perpetrating a fraud without showing the fraud & its effects??? 2) There's no character development: They all start out as disgusting creeps and they all end up being disgusting creeps. 3) There's not much of a plot: It's 2 and 1/2 hours of debauchery and then 1/2 hour of getting caught. The debauchery part goes on forever and gets boring really fast. Not to mention disturbing & disgusting. Did Scorsese really make this movie just to show all this debauchery? What's the point of showing 2 and 1/2 hours of it? We get the point that they are gross lunatics pretty fast. Why keep going with seemingly endless variations of it? There is no point to it. So, when all is said & done, this is basically a movie about debauchery. It should have been called ""Satyrs of Long Island"" instead of ""Wolves of Wall Street"" because these turkeys operated from LI and there's practically nothing in the movie about actual Wall Street firms."
The Wolf of Wall Street,06-Jan-14,"I've always thought that there must be a very good reason for a movie to last 3 hours. Wolf of wall street does last 3 hours but there no shadow of a good reason for it. It could have lasted 1 hour and it would have been already too long.It is difficult to summarize all the things I didn't like but let's try:1- Characters development is simply not existent. There is no depth, just one-dimension flat characters that only do drugs, sex, and money. I am not against showing drugs or sex or money in a movie, if it helps the plot. But in this case, it didn't. It was 2 hours of absolute useless display of all the possible debaucheries on earth, without them helping in building up the characters. 2- If a guy manages to build up an empire based on a fraud, I'd like to see what happens to his victims too, and, sorry if I am not a master of Wall street, but I'd like to have 5 minutes of the movie spent in explaining what was this fraud about. 3- If the guy, once again, not only builds his own empire, but also drags other people in that, I suppose he must have some smartness, or intelligence, or be a master manipulator.. whatever it is, it cannot be just (once again) cocaine and prostitute. If they wanted to depict the guys as villains, they failed miserably. 4- the only relatively interesting part (the trial etc) is cut to 30-45 minutes max. Once again, I supposed it could have been a good chance to show some introspection of the characters, some development..something! But no, once again, nothing. We only notice that now the beer is not alcoholic. So sad. 5-Finally, DiCaprio performance: he did his job, probably, but he was alway over the top (and not in a good sense). Too much of everything, to the point that he fell into being ridiculous more than believable.Ah, one last note. Wall Street? Where is it in all the story? I expected to see some connections to WS in fact, like what was going on in the meantime but there is - sorry to repeat myself- basically nothing about it."
The Wolf of Wall Street,02-Jan-14,"Even though Jordan Belfort is a convicted con man, Scorsese & DiCaprio were apparently too dense to realize that his book was yet another of his scams. They leapt on Belfort's book like pigs on a pile of slop and thought everyone would be just as enamored as they were with the alleged life story of a sociopathic, sleazeball swindler. One example of how they got conned: In real life, Belfort never warned his cohorts that he was wearing a wire! In reality, he was a cry-baby snitch who immediately agreed to testify against his co-conspirators, never giving any of them a word of warning. It's rather amusing to watch Scorsese & DiCaprio as they try to explain that this movie isn't a glorification of Belfort's swindling & debauchery. C'mom, guys, 'fess up, all three hours of the movie is a celebration of it! You wasted $100 million to make an homage to a drug- addicted, misogynistic low-life who swindled people out of their hard- earned money! Proud of yourselves? Here's the ""Spoiler Alert"": You are being conned if you go to this movie. But go ahead and give your hard-earned money to this convicted swindler and the ""Hollywood sophisticates"" who think his pathetically sad life is worth being turned into a movie. Just know that Belfort is laughing all the way to the bank, and you are his latest victim."
The Wolf of Wall Street,11-Apr-14,"The Wolf Of Wall Street details the rise and fall in real life of one Jordan Belfort who for a while was living high and wide off of other people's money. It was good while it lasted until some relentless FBI agents took him down partly because of his own hubris.Leonardo DiCaprio as he did with such other real life figures like Howard Hughes and J. Edgar Hoover, each of who lived large in his own way with power, DiCaprio lives large with money. At first it's the realization of the American dream, DiCaprio the middle class kid wants to go on Wall Street. He goes, but then is one of thousands cast adrift by the stock market crash of the late Reagan years. DiCaprio is not about to give up his dream.He organizes his own brokerage house, similar to what is seen in the more modestly financed film The Boiler Room. But DiCaprio takes it far from a penny stock outfit. With a collection of his own ill assorted bunch of friends chief among them is Jonah Hill, these guys and I do mean it is reserved for the male of the species DiCaprio makes obscene amounts of money and spends it obscenely. That is sure to attract all kinds of law enforcement attention.I have seen very few films that have depicted the alpha male world so well. Women just do not compete in DiCaprio's world. All they serve as are sex objects. Women work on Wall Street in the more traditional brokerage houses, but not with him where being one of the boys is the first requirement. The world consists of 50% orgies and 50% piling up paper profits and later on hiding them from authorities. True of DiCaprio and true to a lesser extent of all his associates.Martin Scorsese directed this film and handled the film like he did one of his gangster epics like Goodfellas. The narration of the film is by DiCaprio and it takes you from his rise to where law enforcement has him between a rock and a hard place. Like Ray Liotta in Goodfellas a combination of drugs and hubris makes him think he's invulnerable. But in Goodfellas would not have had a scene where the wise guys just out and out dared to challenge the FBI as DiCaprio does with agent Kyle Chandler. It so reminded me of that famous incident from 1984 where presidential candidate Gary Hart dares reporters to follow him around to catch him doing anything outside his marriage. And of course they did.Five Oscar nominations went to The Wolf Of Wall Street, nominations for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay and nominations for DiCaprio and Jonah Hill as Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor. Hill was something of a revelation. The kind of nondescript character that you wouldn't look at twice, Hill gets taken to a world that he could only imagine in dreams wet or dry by DiCaprio. In his own Hill is almost as fascinating a story as DiCaprio.The guy who beat Leo out for Best Actor has a brief but telling role as a mentor of sorts. Matthew McConaughey plays a stockbroker who takes him under his wing and they have a great scene at a club where he's getting his first three martini lunch. McConaughey only forgets to teach DiCaprio one thing, discretion.I can understand why women would truly hate this film as they are nothing more than pawns in a male power game, but The Wolf Of Wall Street gives us a fascinating look at a man who tried to play with the big boys of the Stock Exchange and for a while, did."
The Wolf of Wall Street,26-Dec-13,"Yes, Scorsese has always entertained us so well with abberant types, from mobsters to street criminals to boiler room stock brokers, all dealing death or financial destruction 24/7. But, do any of them bear even a faint resemblance to what really happened, and did those people actually behave that way? Regarding this film, I worked on Wall Street during that time, and even though we had heard of Jordan Belfort's firm, it was totally discounted as a boiler room and had no Street cred at all, just a terrible rep as sleazebag junk. It was no more than a side story to the real Wall Street, as those boiler room types were the lowest level of that era's greed-is-good WS slicksters.But, the movie.....could any human superman take the amount of drugs and unprotected sex shown in this story and even function, let alone at a high continuous level and not have a fatal heart attack? None that I have known or seen, and I have seen a lot. But, Dicaprio as Belfort was a marvelous choice for this outsized role, and he played it to the hilt as never before, with Jonah Hill as his sidekick comic relief, and Matthew Macconaughey a great choice for Belfort's oddball, probably whacked out(off?)mentor, and Bob DeNiro in a short mobster spot.It was such fast action that the 3 hours went by quickly, with not a dull moment in it. I enjoyed the fantasy ride that Disney could not have done better, but I could never get past the fact that it was 99% dramatized fiction, done to sell tickets(greed is good!) but not to enlighten us at all about the real Wall Street of that era."
The Wolf of Wall Street,03-Feb-14,"Based on the true story of Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio), from his rise to a wealthy stockbroker living the high life to his fall involving crime, corruption and the federal government.As of now (February 2014), this film sits at an impressive #57 on IMDb's list of greatest films of all time. Using that as a jumping off point for this review, we will have to scale it back a bit. Whether the film should be on the list is debatable, but certainly not within the top 100 -- it is neither that good nor among director Martin Scorsese's best work.Along the same lines, the Oscar nomination for Best Picture is a bit much. While there is no denying it was probably among the ten best films of 2013, with some incredible acting and more than adequate cinematography and editing, the very fact it has no chance of winning makes one question why even nominate the film at all. (Of course, without nine nominees, we would be back to having the reasonable number of five...) Scorsese received a best director nomination, and this strikes me as more understandable. He managed to assemble an impressive cast and tell a story that is both compelling and entertaining, without trying to put some moral tag on it. Whether or not the viewer thinks this is a glorification or denouncement of the acts depicted is up to them, as the film itself is blank (in the best way).While on the subject, could the drug use and sexuality have been toned down? Absolutely. And there is a good argument that they should have been (especially the non-stop sex, which comes across as gratuitous and only adds more minutes to this lengthy financial epic). Another argument says the events are extremely unlikely and exaggerated at times. And this is probably also true; but the film is accurate to the memoir, not reality, and this is Belfort telling his story with all the embellishments that come with it. If you want just the facts, read the court transcripts.Leonardo DiCaprio is nominated for best actor, and this is a choice that is understandable and yet hard to rally behind. He truly becomes Belfort, and probably makes the man out to be even more wild than he was. That deserves a nomination. But this is not DiCaprio's best role (he has also done a fine job portraying Howard Hughes and J. Edgar Hoover) and not one he deserves the win for.Jonah Hill, on the other hand, was amazing and deserves to win his supporting actor category. Being up again Jared Leto, he probably has no chance, but Hill has come a long way in a few short years from a lovable doofus in ""Superbad"" to a formidable actor in his own right. At first, ""Moneyball"" seemed to be an anomaly in Hil's career, but he showed the world he could do even better when he became Donny Azoff in this picture. Incredible.Whether Terence Winter deserves Best Adapted Screenplay for this film is unclear without having read the book. Such a nomination seems fair, though the win is hard to say without more familiarity. I am surprised no nominations came for cinematography or editing, which are strong in their subtlety. But oh well.Of the film's five nominations, it may walk away with one win (Winter) or two at most (DiCaprio). More likely it will walk away empty-handed. The film is not flawless (we could go on about how awkward the soundtrack was) and may or may not go on to be memorable for much more than its nudity and pervasive cursing."
The Wolf of Wall Street,07-Jan-14,"Martin Scorsese could have created a Real Movie about Real Characters who committed terrible acts on Wall Stree. Instead he chose to create a comedy farce for the sole purpose of a box office hit in order to generate tons of cash just like the character Belfort. There is no mention of the victims of Belfort's scams. I cannot believe he has been nominated for Best Director for this piece of Trash. I don't understand how this movie received 8.7 on IMDb.The formula for the Box Office hit Pot Pourri is simple: Wild Parties, Fast Cars, Expensive Houses, Huge Yachts, Drunken Helicopter Pilots, Lots of drinking, drugs, Naked Women, Orgies, guns, Cheating husbands, Money laundering, Slimy Swiss bankers, seducing hot babes, seducing ex-babes (grandmas, And finally,Idiotic Extreme Behavior by brokers who act super smart in one scene And pathetically stupid in another scene. If Tarantino had been the director, I would have said, fine, that is his style, but Marty, I expected a bit more class from him. This movie Glorifies Scumbags who manipulate people who entrust them with their hard earned dollars The scumbags have no moral or ethical dilemmas. The movie turns them into heroes to be emulated. Belfort's sentencing agreement mandates a total of $110 million in restitution yet the victims have received little of this. The script at times makes you think it was written by a hyper-hormoned immature male high school dropout teenager. It tries extremely hard to be funny, yet it falls flat on its face in this arena. Reminded me of a 22 minute sit com on TV, yet no one in my row was laughing at the jokes. The story could have been summarized in 30 minutes, Get ready for 180 minutes We are forced to watch one unnecessary scene after another, the same topic is repeated over and over again, Same arguments, same sales pitches ""Sell me this Pen"", OK I got it, Belfort is a charismatic Speaker and a great Sales Person, I don't need to have it hammered in my brain. The Range of behaviors of the characters go from one Serious Extreme to completely irresponsible infantile idiotic and unbelievably stupid levels. Watch Donnie (Jonah Hill) Play with himself in public when he first takes a look at Naomi Lapaglia ( Margot Robbie ). Remember that he is the Number 2 Lead at the Investment firm and Later in charge of running Stratton Oakmont. How can he be so stupid and so smart at the same time. The Characters are Caricatures of the real people they are supposed to depict. The tone was set after the first few minutes of Belfort's (DiCaprio) narrative while he is starring at the camera. It did not work for me. There are only two decent scenes in this movie that stand out for their realism. When DiCaprio first Seduces his future blonde wife at dinner in the restaurant When The two Fed agents board Belfort's Yacht Nadine and Belfort in a sly arrogant manner attempts to bribe the investigators. Some movies are must see movies Because they change your view of the world and you never forget them. This movie changes nothing."
The Wolf of Wall Street,25-Dec-13,"De Caprio is the heart of the film, a daredevil whose motivation seems to be a misguided desire to acquire as much money as possible. He lives his life as a constant dare, using and abusing the investments of others, gambling with his personal relationships and his own health. He constantly endangers his life and those who are closest to him. It seems like he is capable of stopping this fall, but he keeps sinking and sinking. We could say he has a survivor's nature, but he carries with a very intense death wish, too.Usually, it's easy to understand how people like him become so successful. There's gotta be a bit of charisma to their natures, so that we can see how they seduce the rest of the world into following them. Unfortunately, the main lead here lacks that quality, and in one of the worst casting choices in recent history, what we get is a man who is not full of life and youth. He himself become his own iceberg as he reveals his ""age"" early in the film, and De Caprio hasn't looked that youthful in decades. This is not to say that De Caprio doesn't try, but he's not a good fit for this role. About three years ago, in ""The Social Network"" we could see the recklessness and drive of man who could lure you into a trap. There's no way that seems believable here, especially when you see the people he surrounds himself with. His wolf can't cast a spell, and he can hardly bite.Mercifully, we are not treated to the hyper kinetic editing and camera work we usually encounter in Scorcese's films, but he's found other ways to annoy us. He intermingles ""Infomercials"" throughout the movie, as if we need reinforcement about the seductive power of his character. They are sometimes ridiculous, and I doubt that is the intent. There are also liberties with the source, and it's a pity because the text is a delight to read, giving us the opportunity to wonder how something that is definitely based on reality can appear so unbelievable. The movie tries desperately to portray the excess and trappings of wealth, but there is nothing sexy about the constant parade of prostitutes and the overuse of obscenities, which occur at least every other minute. The books gives us time to breathe. Nothing like that is ever possible here, and that's why the film feels flat, not necessarily boring, but it fails to crackle because it's just too much of the same, never showing us where all the madness originates. There's little fire, just an endless portrayal of stupidity.Not all is lost (like in that other film) because we have a rising star here. Margot Robbie makes quite an entrance and gives the best and most solid performance here, enhanced by the mess the rest of the cast comes up with. She's a formidable beauty, with lots of ambition, an overpowering stare that will let you see that she is not afraid to seek ambition, but she is still a full human being, capable of distinguishing between right and wrong. She reminds you of a more powerful Sharon Stone in her earlier films, and she is as talented as she is gorgeous. Here we see how one person can become obsessed with another, but it also makes you wonder why anyone would even stray from such a beauty. Oh, yes, I forgot it's perfectly obvious drugs can totally ruin your life and turn you into a monster.The film is way too long, with more than a dozen scenes that could have been eliminated because they don't add anything to the story flow. We wish we could see more of the FBI agents, and it would be helpful to see why Wolf doesn't seem to find any way to listen to his father, a wonderful and underused Reiner.We can guess the film's ending from its early frames. It seems as if all the energy goes into the presentation of the material, and little consideration is giving to the dialogue, other than peppering the conversations with redundant expletives. Parading naked people around, having snorting line after line of that white powder, or coming up with sound blasting songs to underscore a point is a brutal point to deliver a message. Just recently the Coens gives us a more dimensional creation with no more than a few ungrateful remarks here and there. All the time I could only wonder how it was that this film escaped the stamping of that NC 17 rating because its only success was the abuse of visual imagery and irritating language that loses its impact as it appears in an endless barrage of mind numbing utterances."
The Wolf of Wall Street,28-Dec-13,How can a film this bad costing $100M get past any adult review process. It seemed like Scorcese and DiCaprio made it for their own egos -- big budget/Gatsby-level theatrics and face-time respectively. DiCaprio does a good job in the role but we all (age range 25 to 65) kept waiting for the movie to come to the point. Hours of redundancy of plot and gratuitous over use of swearing and sex scenes the message and context could have been delivered with about sixty percent less: we kept waiting for a fatal drug overdose to change the direction of the plot and give it some purpose . . We almost walked out a couple of times but did not and waited for the plot to come to a point. We didn't and suffered the full three hours.
The Wolf of Wall Street,06-Jan-14,"Dear Hollywood: It's time for something new.Firstly, this film is entertaining enough and has a great director/cast/performances, blah blah blah -- However we should expect more after this many years of the same tripe from indeed talented people who have done better before. And seriously, how many times can we be entertained by basically the same thing over and over and over, just repackaged? People snorting cocaine. People having sex. Hookers. Bad behavior. Shocking male genitalia in an R-Rated movie when we usually only see bush and knockers. Give me a break. Hate to tell you, although the audience may be comprised of giddy man-children who laugh at dick jokes: Shock value does not equal brilliance. The film started out good and held my attention but the lack of depth written for any character besides Leonardo was awful. Everyone is a caricature of characters we have seen in countless other movies. And I learned less about Jordan Belfort from this three hour film than a three line bio on wikipedia. And: What was the point of this movie? I honestly still have no idea and the ending was especially disappointing and anti-climatic.Bravo for Di Caprio in the role but that is honestly about it. Why was John Favreu even in this film? Why was Mathew McNaughahay wasted for 5 minutes of screen time? It could have challenged the audience by not giving us the stereotypical black and white character development and extra predictable plotting.Scorcese has done a good job of making mob figures and murderers seem charismatic and cool, but this film teaches neither the character or the audience anything at all.I'm rich, so this resort style jail is not that bad. Time to get an inspirational speaking gig and make a Hollywood movie officially validating me as legit. Enough is enough, we need to ask for more out of these ""based on true story"" indulgences. Between Belfort and Hollywood, I would say the latter has ripped off average people the most."
The Wolf of Wall Street,29-Dec-13,"Cricky, lets start of with saying how long and drawn out this movie was. Gosh 3 hours to sit through watching a porn movie(basically) along side drug abuse and lying cheating behavior. Quite a few people actually got up and left during the movie,maybe it got a bit to much for them seeing that you saw naked woman every couple of minutes. Overall the movie glamorized greed. Sad part is there was only about 15 minutes of the whole movie that showed any consequence to this false immoral lifestyle. I feel the message of the movie was wrong and the movie could have had a lot more emotional impact if they had showed this lifestyle in a less glamorous way."
The Wolf of Wall Street,14-Jan-14,"The Wolf of Wall Street (2013)**** (out of 4) Two word review: A Masterpice.Martin Scorsese's latest film is yet another brilliant one with Leonard DiCaprio turning in the greatest performance of his career as stockbroker Jordan Belfort who takes some rather bland people and turn them into one of the biggest scams that the FBI ever saw. THE WOLF OF WALL STREET is going to make many people unhappy and there are many more who are probably going to be offended by it but the perfection that is Scorsese was right when he decided to turn this into a comedy instead of a drama. Yeah, it's GOODFELLAS on speed and ramped up sex but it's just so brilliantly and wickedly funny that you can't help but laugh at all the craziness going on. Yes, there are some moral police out there who are going to object to a movie being made about a man who ripped off poor people but I'm sorry, I like the fact that this film doesn't really care about those people and instead just gives us an in-your-face look at these wild people, their wild drugs and their wild sex lives. This film is certainly over-the-top in regards to the excess but so were the characters so I thought they just went hand and hand with each other. Scorsese was the perfect person for this project because of his ramped up speed but here is goes all out and really delivers an incredibly wicked little ride that will have you smiling and laughing at some very questionable things.I've been a fan of DiCaprio long before he became famous and this here is without question the greatest performance he's given so far. I was curious to see how he would do playing someone crazy and wild like this but he does so perfectly and I'd say it was a flawless performance. No matter what was going on in this crazy life you believe that you're watching a real character and as his character says throughout the film, sell him something. Well, DiCaprio sells this performance and role like no one else could. The supporting players are just as wonderful with Jonah Hill, Margot Robbie, Rob Reiner, Jon Favreau, Matthew McConaughey and Jean Dujardin all delivering terrific performances. The cinematography, the music selections and everything else are just flawless here. THE WOLF OF WALL STREET could have been a complete disaster in so many ways but the strong screenplay and Scorsese's wicked direction makes it an incredibly entertaining film that works so well. It's hard to fully put into words what Scorsese and DiCaprio have pulled off but it's certainly one of the best and most memorable comedies in ages."
The Wolf of Wall Street,01-Jan-14,"Martin Scorsese is losing his gift as a director. The Wolf of Wall Street is another rendition of Scorsese's other movies. The narration, actions, and flow of Wolf of Wall Street is similar to Goodfellas, Casino and Mean Streets. Di Capiro's lead character is just another version of the Henry Hill character from the movie Goodfellas. Through the streetwise narration of Di Capiro one learns how the system is scammed, and experiences dysfunctional behaviour of drugs, and prostitutes. The characters lack of morals creates the usual drama stew of low lives. Scorsese tries to spice up the old recycled formula with nudity, massive drug use, over the top sex, which can not compensate for the lack of story depth. 3 hours was way too long for a half hour story. Five stars out of ten."
The Wolf of Wall Street,31-Dec-13,"Wolf is a waste unless you are a 19-year-old boy who thinks Napoleon Dynamite was funny. Sex without passion. Drugs without end. Scenes without points. Acting without entertainment. But let's go to the board.1. Sex.....tons of it. This film is pretty well soft porn. But it is also about as sexually exciting as watching a Zamboni polish an ice rink....and about as cold. 2. Drugs.....tons of it. Think of Scarface levels. Hey, drunks are funny, right? Think Cheech and Chong without the laughs. 3. Vulgarity.....worse than Bridesmaids and much less humorous. During WWII, the US 8th Air Force delivered nearly 700 thousand tons of explosives. If each one of them had had the f-word painted on them, it still would fall short of the f-bombing in this movie. But even if the pretty naked girls had been arousing, the drug quantities smaller, and the vulgarity lighter, it still would be a tremendously boring film.I am sure it will be touted as a great movie....a modern Gatsby tale. I am sure there will be rewards. I am sure Tarrentino will rip it off and be declared a genius. But none of that will change the fact that Wolf of Wall Street is a dog on the screen."
Vivarium,29-Feb-20,"Got a half decent idea for a short tv episode (but hey... leave out the cuckoo opening scenes then, no need to spell out the whole thing beforehand) but as a feature it's just an amateurish mess without much thought, balance in it's storytelling or coherence behind it (and yes it is ""surreal"" but that doesn't make it any better)"
Vivarium,28-Apr-20,"There are many artworkss I have come across I don't understand, or that grate on my eyes and ears, but I could never say 'this is the worst I've ever come across, I want my money or time back.' I just acknowledge I don't understand it and move on. The rhetoric used in many reviews here (and on other titles here) is nothing short of churlish and immature. I hope people with more rational minds can ignore the cancel culture reviews, use better judgement as to whether this film is worth their time or money and give equally fair reviews.That being said, I've given this a 7 (a 'good' but not 'great' in my personal estimation, your mileage may vary) and recommend this highly to lovers of noir fantasy/science fiction parables, or bleak social commentary framed in a Carrollian/Kafka-esque/David Lynch set-up. Many others, like me, may probably like, enjoy or appreciate it to varying degrees, but shouldn't 'hate' it.The two leads (Eisenberg and Poots) are quite up to the demands their predicament puts on them, and show a varied range of emotions and states. The supporting child actor, however, gives me the willies! If that wasn't his normal voice I was hearing, his mannerisms, posture and acting were still scarily on-point. (If that was his voice, however, his career should skyrocket.) As a 'family' their dynamic is both an exaggerated mirror of modern unprepared families, as well as a starkly portrayed descent into madness.Set design and overall production quality was obviously low-budget but very effective nonetheless. It perfectly evokes the subliminal nausea that modern suburbia often instills. You are asked to pay more attention to the tasteless food, the cookie cutter clouds and the pictures on the walls to better understand the complete lack of emotion or creativity of the antagonists, how completely different a species they are.The script is the only thing I knock a point off for. While it didn't do anything 'wrong', per se, I can agree with some reviewers that maybe, just maybe, some kind of clarification, exposition or slightly less bleak ending would make it more palatable to a much wider audience, but then we would be as remiss as if we asked Picasso to paint the whole face, or Jackson Pollock to join some of the dots up and give us a clue... Sadly, therefore, the point lost is for my own (and others) lack of vision or understanding, not the Writer/Director's ability."
Vivarium,19-Jul-20,"I've been in quarantine since mid-march. I's now mid July. I've literally haven't left my house during this entire time - not to run errands, not to walk around the block. I haven't been outside.Or maybe I should say I haven't been outside the perimeter of my house. I have been in my backyard on good weather days.So my life consists of my husband going out getting food, doing most of the cooking, serving me breakfast and dinner and sometimes lunch because he likes to keep busy and I've become a slug.I go to bed I get up I do work. Then I stop working watch some TV and go to bed and get up and do it all over again and I've been doing this day after day for 100 and 20 days.I can relate. I think it's obvious what's going on. There were a lot of breadcrumbs thrown around along the way.Obviously, these are aliens and they are studying our species to learn how to imitate us (notice that's what the kid was doing and his voice was a combination of both ""parents"") to eventually take over the world.Apparently they are a patient species. It looks to me like the world that they created had several levels and there were ""families"" on each level.I guess soon enough they'll push us out of our nest much like the cuckoo bird and replace us.The end."
Vivarium,24-Jul-20,"Don't listen to those dullard consumers that have been brought up on a steady diet of bangs and flashes. This isn't a mainstream film, rather it resembles a play, which gives a nod to Samuel Beckett's ""Waiting for Godot"". With it's limited cast, static set design and dreamlike colours and soundtrack, I found myself mesmerised by every detail of this surreal little odyssey. It's necessary to absorb the atmosphere and dread of the existential nightmare that unfolds in order to enjoy the way it gets inside your head and alters your mood. Personally this is exactly the kind of movie which doesn't make me feel that I've wasted an evening. You can keep your guns and explosions, this is the closest I've felt to visiting a theatre since it's been impossible to do so. If you enjoyed The Twilight Zone as a kid this will feel nostalgic, though I sense it makes a bigger comment on the psychology of being human, or perhaps isolated... perfect for the times. Well done actors and designers. No it won't be for everyone, but I loved it."
Vivarium,27-Mar-20,Full waste of time although I have a lot of free time due to lock down still this time could have been used for something else.
Vivarium,18-May-20,"I agree that this movie isn't for everyone - that doesn't mean it's no good. Maybe it's just what I saw in the film when I watched it that made it so impactful. The movie is not called ""Suburbia"" - it's ""Vivarium"". That should have given you a clue. To me it's a movie about, for example, what fish in an aquarium or lions in a modern zoo must feel/think while researchers explore and try to understand their behaviour. Extending that further...it might also be what an invading force might do in order to prepare for battle I.e. study the enemy.
In that context I think it's a must see."
Vivarium,02-Apr-20,"The way this movie played out and ended felt very similar to a black mirror episode that felt like it's missing something.... there are a lot of great things in this movie (performance, cinematography, color scheme) but it doesn't make up for the one thing it lacks- excitement. Honestly watching this movie made me feel like I ate a big meal and I'm full from it but it wasn't what I was craving and overall bland. I have this feeling that the point of this movie is to make you feel like nothing. make you feel melancholy and/or depressed. It really makes you question your existence, your place on earth, if perfection is really what we crave and if life really matters, so it did achieve its goal however it probably could have been slightly more entertaining but then maybe it wouldn't have been as effective? It's a tough grey area. I probably wouldn't watch it again or recommend it to someone who's depressed. If you like unique artsy surreal films give it a go but don't expect too much. (Excuse my horrible grammar and spelling)"
Vivarium,28-Mar-20,"I honestly cannot believe we watched the entire movie but we really wondered how this got decent reviews so we stuck with it. All I can say is the writer, director and Eisenherg had all of their friends and acquaintances sign up and give 10 stars.The movie never goes anywhere and has no purpose. The characters have no purpose and accomplish nothing besides digging a hole. It is so nothing. Lol. I would rather watch the season finale of Lost once a week for the rest of the year than watch this again.It was sooo bad I showed my kid the highlights, took less than 5 minutes.I gave it 2 stars just because it was bad enough where I was inspired to sign up and write this review."
Vivarium,25-Feb-20,"I take that back of course: Vivarium is an ingenious commentary about ______
Either that or it's a completely innocuous science fiction/fantasy story without any meaning, and anyone demanding meaning is clearly just a snob.
The nice thing about hollow movies like this is critics can have it both ways. This is some kind of brilliant and profound statement about some kind of prescient social issue...and if you complain about it being pretentious, you just don't know how to have fun!As much as some ideas were interesting here, this movie is a dull slog filled with overacting, not convincing special effects, constant waffling on vague philosophy and mostly just bored, grouchy looking people in dimly lit rooms staring into space.The only real attention paid was to making the film look pretty, and it does at times, but the over stylization takes away from any potential feeling of real peril.If it was supposed to be profound, don't make it so silly. If it was supposed to be entertaining don't make it so plodding and self-impressed."
Vivarium,27-Mar-20,"The 27th March of 2020 is a good day, a decent day, a day to enjoy a fresh Jesse Eisenberg double feature - ""Resistance"" and ""Vivarium"". The latter proved to be an entertaining and thoughtful parable in the atmospheric and thematic traditions of ""The Twilight Zone"", yet not without its flaws and misses.""Vivarium"" is almost entirely based on a metaphor/s, a parable of an often-used theme, a story that knows what it wants to say but, despite a nice flow of inventiveness, can't keep it consistently substantial. The vert first minutes, the intro sequence, heavily foreshadows what ideas are to follow without even using any characters yet. Later on, there are points where the commentary is perhaps too obvious and spoon-fed. Rushed-in family-hood, the challenges of parenthood, ownership and more similar ideas are presented and worked into a dystopian, lab-rat-like environment. There's a decent dose of humor injected in it as well, the more grim kind. The movie plays off its cast's content and realistic little performances, a top-notch, eye-pleasing production design and various atmosphere-setting devices, trying to be an intriguing survival drama that's swimming around the surface while continuously hinting on a something deeper. The deeper never truly comes. ""Vivarium"" succeeds at being a drawn-out episode of what could be an anthology horror series, but as a full feature it lacks additional components. For the most part, it is enough with the presented themes, the distressing and messed up character's new routine and the fantastic, mysterious elements surrounding it, but... ""Vivarium"" has got style, but half-way through it slowly ceases to be enough & as a climax we receive... even more style. Basically, as far as atmosphere, special effects and indie arthouse creativity goes, ""Vivarium"" is a great little flick worth seeing, but chances of eventual underwhelment are there.For anyone who loves oddball indies, mysterious concepts, metaphors, borderless creepiness and what people call ""Twilight Zone-esque"", ""Vivarium"" is a journey worth taking. Should it succeed, thoughts might be provoked. My rating: 7/10."
Vivarium,18-Apr-20,"What a weird, odd but somehow enthralling movie. It really should have been boring but somehow it kept me interested the whole time. I'm not sure why. And it's the kind of movie I usually hate because you get no real answer at the end. Theres a lot of things that maybe they were trying to say about suburbia life and such, maybe trying to be artsy, but I never really care about that kind of thing, yet again I liked it.Maybe it's got to do with the isolation part. I watch this and think hey, our isolation ain't bad. If you haven't seen it and you like quirky weird movies give it a whirl, might grab you like it did me."
Vivarium,27-Mar-20,"Weird only for the sake of being weird. I'm easy on movies/people's creative efforts. I usually hand out 8s, 9s, and 10s as if they were Gummy Bears and Blo-Pop suckers for the kids on Halloween. On the rare occasion where I do dip below 5 stars I most often do what my mother always told me to do. If I can't say something nice...I don't say anything at all. And yet, here I am. Disappointed in the movie after 97 minutes of hoping it would offer some appreciable redeeming or artistic value (I strongly hesitate to criticize its artistic value since I myself can barely cut and paste) only to be sadly disappointed by its emptiness. How bad could it be I reasoned? After all my boy Jesse Eisenberg is in it and most of his movies are usually 8s... Aren't they?
Sorry, but I will not take the time to describe the storyline or plot to you. Instead I will recommend that you see the trailer on YouTube to get the feel and flavor of this movie and keep in mind that what you see is what you get. And that's all."
Vivarium,27-Mar-20,"That sums up the movie. Just... what? Okay then.There was no point to this. Nothing. It was just made to be made. Biggest waste of time I've ever sat through in my life. Nothing is explained and nothing happens.Seriously. Don't watch this if you're expecting some weird and bizarre movie with a twist. It's black mirror episode that was trashed and someone found the crumpled up sticky note of it and decided to make a movie with it.You can poke holes all you want into the ""theme"" or ""art"" of it; the ""hidden"" messages or ""intellectual"" understanding. I seriously think it was made to just be made.I love weird and bizarre movies. Even ones that are so far out there that many just can't tolerate. This, however, is nothing but time lapsed scenery with actors messing around.It was leading up to an interesting concept, to only leave you off with ""THATS IT!?"" It's like a pilot episode to a show that gets you hooked. But there's no following episode to continue the mystery because it's a movie.If you want to see Jesse being Jesse, watch. If you want to marvel at how beautiful and talented Imogen is, watch. All I got out of this movie, if I can come up with anything at all, is, wow, Imogen is a pretty woman and can convincingly act out any emotion well.Don't let people tell you this only for smart people to understand. It's not. It's an empty glass that's pretty to look at when you're thirsty."
Vivarium,27-Mar-20,"Although the film is creatively pretty well made and keeps you on the edge, well. almost until the last 12 mins or so, it is a MASSIVE waste of an anti-climax. Do not waste your time whatsoever. It leads to NOTHING. Literally nothing. And you'll be left with nothing but a weight of regret of wasting your last hour and more. Blasphemously disappointed. because I kept expecting an epiphanous moment LOL!"
Vivarium,27-Mar-20,"I liked it, I like that they've shown us something different from the norm, something a little odd. I was glued to the screen, captivated, it's a mystery but it's one that you'll be saying TF!. If you like reading or viewing some of Stephen king now and then, then you too could probably appreciate the movie for its surrealty value. The movie does have a message too, however, it's a bit bleak but it is there, you could say it's somebody's metaphor/anxieties about suburban-life."
Vivarium,31-Mar-20,"Objectively, this movie is well thought out, acted, and shot. The plot quite honestly creeped me out and gave me nightmares (no kidding, the child in this movie filled me with a nameless dread) but it is absolutely worth a watch, which puts it into a category of about 8% of films on the market (imho). Imogen Poots takes us through the film bad mushroom trip version of what the climax of interstellar was for a good DMT trip, if that makes any sense. Jesse Eisenberg captures the dread of a colorless, myopic existence. This film was sort of indescribable. All the more anxiety inducing watching this during the COVID-19 pandemic."
Vivarium,10-Sep-19,"Saw it at the German Fantasy Filmfest.Some kind of kafkaesque sisyphussian family horror tale. Not for everyone, because it will let you lay awake at night with grinding teeth obsessing about the cruelty of life. But well worth the watch anyway.Because it has a real clever script. And it keeps your guessing what it's about until it throws you in the pit in the very last scene. Yeah, it's kind of depressing. But it's pretty original too. Some kind of unique satire. And it's beautiful shot. With good leads. If you like weird movies this one is definitely for you."
Vivarium,12-May-20,"Honestly surprised this movie received so many low reviews. Many reviewers complained about a lack of answers or a conclusion. I couldn't disagree more. We don't know where this evil in the movie originates from, we don't know how it works, we don't know its goals, why things are happening. And that's what makes it great as it gives it an air of mystique and makes it even scarier, in my opinion. Giving it all an thorough explanation would simply ruin it. This movie is just like a good creepypasta and some horrors are better left unexplained."
Vivarium,13-May-20,Very strange but good concept. With an ending that keeps you wondering what I just watched.
Vivarium,11-Apr-20,"First, I really appreciate risky movies, that's why I watched this. Now, I can say is one of the worst movies I've ever watched. The scenes that the boy was screaming all the time were a real nightmare. Boring nonsense from beginning to end.
So, if you're in a lockdown like me, just go to fix anything at home instead watching this."
Vivarium,16-May-20,I really liked this movie. I did not like that when it ended I felt just as confused. Not a bad movie. I wish it had answers to why things happened the way it did. Why did the guy die? Did the people before dig just like Jessie did? Who and what were the creatures? Where did they come from? Why did humans have to raise the kids? Why didn't the people kill the kid? So confusing.
Vivarium,28-Mar-20,"This film is so unique and many ways. Probably one the best I've seen in a while, I don't understand how this got so much hate. The idea is so original, I've always wanted to see a movie like this. The acting was great, I was left feeling so creeped out from time to time but I was also so curious to see what happened next, it was so unpredictable. I absolutely loved it. I also recently watched the movie 'The Art Of Self Defence, starring both Jesse Eisenberg and Imogen Poots, also. These are two both great films and these two actors need to do more films like these!"
Vivarium,28-Mar-20,"I've seen some 'klunkers' in my time, but I want my hour and thiry seven minutes back. Others have explained that it prepares you for a journey into sci-fi world type adventure. However, it leads nowhere, the story line is a total bust, and the ending is so predictable, it's pedantic, yet learning nothing of interest at all. Actually, it is obnoxious because of the typical bratty child the couple ""must"" raise....
Don't waste your money or your time..."
Vivarium,21-Apr-20,"I watched the movie. Then I started reading the reviews and before long. A pattern seemed to emerge. Generally speaking. The people who appear to be the least entertained by the movie also appear to have the most to say about it. I find that rather odd in itself. There appears to be a purpose to every event and object in the movie. Whether over or understated, connected or disconnected. The entire movie appears to nudge and provoke the psych without giving many conclusions and leaving the audience to interpret the movie in a variety of different ways. In other words. Thought provoking. Since there is a trend these days for action movies that are simply exercises in mindless destruction. I'm not surprised it would leave many people cold. Is it a good or a bad movie? I'm sorry but the only way you are going to answer that question is to watch the movie and decide for your self. To the question; does this review contain spoilers? The answer is yes and no but since I can only select one or the other. You can take my selection either way."
Vivarium,28-Mar-20,"Just because you don't understand something doesn't automatically make it crap. It makes you a lazy and ignorant reviewer of movies and film. David Lynch once said, ""It's better not to know so much about what things mean. Because the meaning, it's a very personal thing, and the meaning for me is different than the meaning for somebody else."" If you agree with this statement, try this movie on for size. If not, go back to watching reality television."
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,23-Mar-18,"Having read the first few Harry Potter books before 2001 and hearing about the hype for the first movie, I was excited. I heard there was going to be an all-British cast (which makes sense, right?) and we'd get to see a live version of one of the defining novels of our generation. From what I remember I went with my family and a family friend to see the movie the day after Christmas and was pleasantly amazed. After the movie was over, I watched the credits and discovered some familiar names (the late Alan Rickman, Sister Act's Maggie Smith, James Bond 007's Robbie Coltrane, and Star Wars' Warwick Davis); others not so familiar (the kids, some of whom had their debut). But it was a good movie and was a party of colors and sights for all to see. This is easily my favorite of all the Harry Potter films. The catalyst of the movie series!"
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,21-Nov-01,"Once upon a time (and not that long ago), in the vivid, fertile imagination of author J.K. Rowling, a character was born:  A boy.  A young boy named Harry, who was destined to become one of the most beloved characters to emerge from a work of fiction in a long, long time, and was quickly embraced by young and old alike in all corners of the world.  And now, thanks to the magic of the cinema, Harry and his companions fairly leap from the pages of the novel to the silver screen in the phenomenal motion picture, `Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,' directed by Chris Columbus and written for the screen by Steve Kloves.  Indeed, Harry Potter is a boy, but not just any boy; because Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) just happens to be a wizard.  But, orphaned as a baby, Harry has been raised by his Aunt Petunia (Fiona Shaw) and Uncle Vernon Dursley (Richard Griffiths), who never let him in on the fact that he was, well-- what he was.  It seems that Petunia didn't approve of her own sister-- Harry's mother-- because she was a witch; nor of Harry's father because he, too, was a wizard.  When Harry turns eleven, however, the secret is out of the bag when-- after some strange goings-on-- a giant of a man named Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) shows up at the Dursley's door to collect Harry and take him off to `Hogwarts,' a school for wizards and witches and all who would perfect the gift with which they were born:  The gift of magic!  And from the moment Harry boards the train (from station platform nine-and-three-quarters) that will take him to his destiny, the magic is alive-- for Harry, and for the audience, as well; and it's a journey you will never forget.	What a monumental undertaking to even think of attempting-- translating and transferring this passionately beloved work from novel to the screen. Because to millions of people, Harry and his companions are so much more than merely characters in a book; these are characters for whom people have made a special place in their hearts, which puts a great burden of trust upon the man who would attempt to bring them to life.  And Chris Columbus, it turns out, was the right man for the job.  More than rising to the occasion and with some magic of his own-- and a lot of help from an extraordinarily talented cast and crew-- Columbus has delivered a film that is not only true to the story, but true to the very spirit that makes Harry Potter so special.  The special effects are absolutely beyond astounding, and Columbus, with a keen eye for detail and without missing a beat, keeps it all on track and moving right along at a pace and with a sense of timing that makes this an absorbing, thoroughly entertaining and enjoyable experience from beginning to end.  From the opening frame you get the feeling that you're about to have a singular experience; and you're right. Because you've just entered the world of Harry Potter.  And it's magic.	Even having the best special effects do not a great movie make, however, and this film is no exception; what catapults this one to the top are the performances, beginning with Radcliffe, whom you quickly forget is an actor playing a part.  And that about sums up what kind of a job this young man does here.  Without question, he IS Harry Potter, physically and emotionally, and when he waves his wand and does what he does, you believe it.  A wonderful performance by a gifted actor who has a great career ahead of him; without question the perfect choice for the role of Harry.	Also turning in excellent performances are Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley, and Emma Watson as Hermione.  As with Radcliffe, the casting here could not have been more perfect.  Grint is `Everyboy,' with that special glint in his eye and a manner that makes him especially endearing.  And the spunky Watson adds some real sparkle to the film as Hermione, the one with the sense of urgency and the wherewithal to get things done; a real role model for young girls everywhere.	It's obvious that a lot of care went into the casting of this film, and it's a big part of why it is so successful.  Richard Harris, as Headmaster Albus Dumbledore; Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall; John Hurt as Mr. Ollivander; Ian Hart as Professor Quirrell.  Exceptional performances from one and all, with two that stand out as especially memorable:  Robbie Coltrane, who readily conveys the fact that Hagrid's heart is of a size that matches that of the man; and Alan Rickman, as Professor Severus Snape, deliciously droll while demonstrating menace through the fine art of articulation.  	The additional supporting cast includes John Cleese (Nearly Headless Nick), Warwick Davis (Professor Flitwick), Julie Walters (Mrs. Weasley), Zoe Wanamaker (Madame Hooch), Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy), Harry Melling (Dudley) and David Bradley (Filch).  From Rowling's imagination to the written page to real life (albeit via the movie screen), `Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone' is a triumph many times over; a unique film of truly universal appeal, the likes of which is as rare as, well-- a sorcerer's stone.  A film in which adults and children alike will rejoice, because it speaks to the heart in a universal language of life, love, experience and imagination; a film that states unequivocally that magic exists-- as long as there's a single child with a single dream somewhere in the world, and real wizards like J.K. Rowling, Chris Columbus, Steve Kloves and every member of this wonderful cast and crew around to bring it to life as they have here.  An instant classic in every sense of the word, this is truly a film for the ages.  A remarkable achievement, this IS the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 10/10."
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,05-Jun-18,"The breeze stirred the neatly cut bushes of Tisovaya Street, silently lying under the ink-black sky. Of all the streets in the world, this street was the least suitable for amazing events. Harry Potter turned in his sleep. A small hand groped for it and squeezed the envelope. The boy was asleep ... ""(c)June 30, 1997 in the light came the debut of the writer Joan Kathleen Rowling. Literally such words began to become great, a series about a small wizard, with a scar on his forehead. The story that absorbed the minds of adolescents around the world, as it was said in the press ""... a book that can tear boys and girls away from TVs and computers, return it to the house from the street ...""Just imagine...""A dull, dank, dark night. In the street a storm. The little boy lies on the floor of his ""room"", in a small shack and draws a finger in the sand with an inscription, ""Happy Birthday, Harry!"". The cry of the soul, he knows that no one will congratulate him, no one will affably caress the top of his head. In a minute he will be eleven. Ten seconds ... Nine ... You can wake Dudley - just for laughing ... Three ... Two ... One ... A loud knock at the door, there's no knock, just a crash. There was someone behind the door, and he was obviously going to come in. ""I think anyone will guess what happened next. Good-natured giant Hagrid, told Harry the striking news that he is not just a boy with a scar on his forehead, but a real magician.A short word about the actors.HarryWhat to say, there would not be Harry James Potter, there would not be the book itself. Whatever happens in the books, I was always entirely for his character. In the first part, he's just small, you can even tell a confused boy. All situations, difficult fights, intricate situations, are still ahead. Now he just scooped up this great knowledge - magic. The first real home, first friends, first classes, the first meeting with this evil, he is experiencing all this in the first part.
HermioneHermione Jane Granger is my favorite female character in the book and film. In it, I see a part of myself. Hermione loves to learn and she pays a lot of time. Sometimes she is too arrogant and excessively proud of her success in her studies. Born of a muggle, so often heard the offensive word ""Mudblood"" in her address. Hermione is just a smart girl, how many times she has yet to pull friends out of difficult situations.RonRonald Bilius Weasley. Redhead. Already this word can give some characteristic. Ron is the sixth child in a wealthy family of hereditary magicians. Always the elders took on everything superior to Ron, be it study, sport, or female attention. Arriving at Hogwarts, gets to know Harry, the same situation is repeated as with the brothers, but he reconciles with his second plan. Whatever it is, he remains the best friend of Harry and Hermione.I wanted to say that the whole trio was exactly the same as it was represented by millions of readers in the world. Actors took absolutely unknown, but this film made them real little stars.The movie has good enough, more famous actors, the same Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltrane, Julie Walters and the inimitable Richard Harris. His death was just a blow to all the fans, his Dumbledore seemed to come off the pages of the book, the same wise look from under the half-glasses, gray hair and beard, hooked nose. He inspired a kind of majestic calmness, every appearance on the screen calming. By the way, I do not consider Michael Gambon a good Dumbledore, he turned out to be some kind of crazy, but this is not on this topic.
It is quite possible to write now a complete retelling of the book / movie, but you know, absolutely do not want to. Joan Rowling created an amazing, magical world, thanks to her, millions of boys and girls began to look for a scar on their foreheads and with impatience and hope to wait for their 11th birthday. And I'm certainly happy about how Chris Columbus embodied this idea on the screen, the fairy tale turned out to be absolutely childish, very bright, joyful and for some reason the word Christmas comes to mind, although there is not so much Christmas there.Children's dream came true. Harry found his friends, his family, found loyal defenders, but he does not even suspect what he will have in the future. However, it will not be soon, but now enjoy watching!Dedicated to: all those who are ready to go with Harry to the end."
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,10-Nov-01,"To be faced with the challenge of adapting Harry Potter for the Silver screen must have been any director's nightmare- the chance of directing possibly the biggest film of this decade, but also the hardest audience-the millions of fans of the book who know every line and will pick up on every mistake. Being one of the above, I can only say that Christopher Columbus and all of the team working on HP did marvelously. The cast was brilliant (particularly notable are Alan Rickman as Snape, Maggie Smith as McGonagall, and the eerily creepy David Bradley as Argus Filch), the directing wonderful, and the scenery perfect. The only qualm is that it does not track perfectly with the book, but squeezed into 2.5 hours, this can only be expected. Well done all involved!"
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,20-Nov-01,"I enjoyed this movie immensely. But, like ""The Phantom Menace,"" I've had a very hard time viewing it objectively. There was so much anticipation leading up to its release, I simply enjoyed the experience of being there. Having read all four books in the series a few times each, I am overly familiar with the events in the story. As I watched the movie, my continuing thought was ""How well will the next part of the story be translated to the screen?"" rather than ""How entertaining is this film overall?"" I have trouble answering the latter question because I was already entertained by watching a wonderful story dramatized, so I'll never know how I'd have reacted had I seen this movie without having read the books.Critics talk about how incredibly faithful the movie is to the book, and perhaps I'd have had an easier time detaching the two in my mind had the movie set off on its own course. Indeed, many classic children's movies, like ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""Mary Poppins,"" are so successful partly because they're so different from the books that inspired them. But these are exceptions; in my experience, most children's movies reveal their weaknesses in how they diverge from the books upon which they're based. And much of what makes the Harry Potter phenomenon unique is that it is the first time in ages that a children's book, without a movie accompanying it, has generated this much popularity. According to an article I read a year ago, the universe of Harry Potter has become as real in the minds of youngsters and adults as that of a popular movie series like Star Wars. Therefore, it will be very hard for any film based upon it to compete with it. In the minds of die-hard fans, any changes made to the story will be seen as desecrating the fantasy world that Rowling created. That's why it's easy to understand why the filmmakers were so reluctant to change anything.As a faithful rendering of the book squeezed into a two-and-a-half hour period, the movie is beautifully done. I don't have a single complaint about any of the actors, who successfully bring to life, with the aid of costume design and special effects, the many colorful characters from the book. My favorite character, the giant Hagrid, is played by Robbie Coltrane, and I say with no exaggeration that he is exactly how I imagined him while reading the book. It's as if they took the image in my mind and transferred it to the screen. While I had my own personal image of Snape (for some reason, I always imagined him as the head villain from another Chris Columbus film, ""Adventures in Babysitting""), Alan Rickman is perfect in the role. I usually expect to have words of criticism for some performances, but I just don't. The remaining adult actors, including Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall and Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore, are as good as they possibly could be, and the kids do an excellent job of holding their own against these veterans. Some have criticized Daniel Radcliffe for appearing too subdued in the title role, but that's exactly how the character is portrayed in the book: modest, unassuming, and laid-back. The kids who play Harry's two best friends are flawless.I had a lot of worries about the fact that it was being directed by Chris Columbus, whose entire directorial career so far has consisted of over-the-top slapstick films. I was pleasantly surprised that he did not direct the Harry Potter film in this way. Except for brief moments like the children's delayed reaction to a giant three-headed dog they encounter and Harry's swallowing the quaffle ball, there is nothing here to remind us that this film is directed by the same person who gave us films like ""Home Alone"" and ""Mrs. Doubtfire."" Indeed, I think Columbus may have gone just a tad bit too far in trying not to make the film seem cartoony. I would have liked to see a little more emotion on the actors' faces at certain times. Overall, however, his restraint works nicely in giving the film the kind of believability the book possesses.But much is left out. Harry's caretaker Uncle Vernon, a prominent character in the book, is given less attention in the movie than some of the bit characters. The gently satirical aspects of Hogwarts School aren't in the movie at all. We never see the ghostly history teacher who died several years back but kept on teaching. Lines like the following--""Professor McGonagall watched [her students] turn a mouse into a snuffbox--points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was, but taken away if it had whiskers""--find no equivalent in the movie. The movie does include platform nine-and-three-quarters, though the way the kids disappear into the wall isn't as mysterious as I had visualized, and the sorting hat is there, minus the great poem explaining the differences between the four schools.Not that I'm blaming the movie for omitting some details. Some things from the book would not have translated easily to the screen, and it would have been very difficult to stick everything in. Had Columbus done so and allowed the film to be as long as necessary (eight hours, maybe?), like a BBC miniseries, the film might have been a masterpiece, but few kids would ever have had the patience or attention span to sit through it.The problem is that the amusing details are much of what make Harry Potter such a special story. A whole universe is created in Rowling's series, in which a magical society exists within our own ordinary ""muggle"" world and is kept secret by a bureaucracy with its own rules, history and politics. The way magic is treated in her books, not as something medieval but as very similar to the way our own contemporary world works, is a large part of their charm. Take away these details, and you're left with a fairly conventional tale of a young wizard fighting an evil sorcerer.Although the audience I was with broke into applause as soon as the movie ended (something I've never seen happen before, though I don't go to the theater that often), some people have complained about the movie dragging at certain points. I didn't have that problem, but, as I said, I wasn't really trying to get involved in the movie's story. After thinking about it, it does seem like parts of the movie fail to convey a sense of urgency. Why should this be? I never felt that way when reading the books, and this is without a doubt the very same story.The answer, I think, is that the books portray much of Harry's anxiety in trying to succeed in school (for if he's kicked out, he'll go straight back to his horrible uncle) and fit in with the kids there. The movie doesn't tap into these anxieties enough, so why should we care whether he wins the Quidditch match (other than that he survives in one piece) and gets through the school year? The only real suspense in the movie after he arrives at Hogwarts comes from the story of Lord Voldemort returning, which in the book is almost secondary. Harry's adventures getting along in the school are fun and interesting, but as they are presented to us in the film, there isn't enough tying them all together.What we have here is a serviceable dramatization of a wonderful children's series, but it doesn't entirely succeed in standing on its own. Perhaps it should have diverged from the book just a little, to compensate for the difficulties in translating some of the book's delights to the screen. In its current form, it's almost like a preview of the book. Its lack of fullness, and its dependence on the book, might actually increase the popularity and endurance of Rowling's series by making those who see the film yearn for more, which they can get from the real thing."
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,17-Jun-19,"There's nothing like the first in a series, is there? The introduction to the characters, the immersion into the fictional world, the first time you laugh, cry, care, and fear for someone's safety can never be repeated. No matter how many Harry Potter movies they crank out, or if they ever remake them in the future, none will come close to the wonderful first film, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.I'm sure everyone has their own childhood memories of reading the Harry Potter books that they'll tell their grandkids about, but I'll never forget going to see the first movie in the theaters. The lights dimmed, John Williams's perfect theme played its first notes as Richard Harris walked down Privet Drive, and everyone in the theater was transported to another world. John Williams's numerous themes, all wonderful and a personification of the wizarding world, took the early movies to another level. As other composers tried their hands at the later films, that quality was missing. There's something truly special about going to see this movie on the big screen, and while the ""magical"" qualities might not all be credited to the music, it's certainly one of them.Welcome to the world of Harry Potter, where if you're a ten-year-old kid who doesn't fit in, you might get a letter delivered by an owl telling you you have magical powers and should go to a special school to hone them. Believe it or not, there are people who watch this movie without reading the books, so a bit of description is necessary. Obviously the stars of the show are the children, who were selected out of millions of other kids to be able to memorize lines, not look in the camera, endear themselves to worldwide audiences, and hopefully act. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, and Tom Felton are so cute and tiny in this first movie, you'll undoubtedly find yourself re-watching it as the years pass just to see them as kids again. I always marvel that child actors train themselves not to look in the camera, so even if their performances aren't perfect, I cut them slack, knowing firsthand how hard it is. And these kids had to dress in funny costumes, recite incantations without laughing, and pretend they're looking at things that were added in post production!Usually, in kids' movies, there's a grown-up or two who add to the cast and make the adult audience members feel less silly that they're watching it. In the Harry Potter movies, everyone wanted to be in them! Throughout the series you'll see a host of familiar faces as ""guest stars"" but the regulars will make special places in your heart. Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, and Robbie Coltrane are household names for little kids, because they're so convincing as the kindhearted Dumbledore, the wizened but sentimental McGonagall, the endlessly mimicable Snape, and the jolly Hagrid, kids today can't imagine they've had any other career prior to these movies! Is there any kid who doesn't immediately attribute the word ""earwax"" to Richard Harris, point out striped cats as ""Maggie Smith cats"", mumble ""Shouldn't have said that,"" when they make a mistake, or practice putting pauses in their sentences like Alan Rickman?First movies are so special, since they introduce audiences to a world that will hopefully capture their attention for however many more movies will be made. In J.K. Rowling's fantasy world, there's so much to fall in love with; and in the film adaptation you can really believe it exists. Seeing the Hogwarts structure for the first time creates a special feeling in your heart that can only be recaptured by watching the movie again or going to see the next in the series. The Great Hall, Quidditch, the Sorting Hat, talking portraits, flying lessons, selecting the perfect wand-all these Harry Potter moments are perfectly recreated in the first of a series that saw an entire generation grow up buying toy wands and trying Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans.Each installment has its special moments, and this first one has quite a few, even outside of the exposition. If a three-headed dog doesn't immediately conjure the name ""Fluffy,"" chess pieces have never come to life in your imagination, you don't laugh at the idea of counting your birthday presents, and you don't know what Richard Harris wants most in the world, you're missing out on one of the great joys in life. If somehow 2001 passed you by without a trip to the movie theaters Thanksgiving weekend, go find yourself a copy of this iconic, lovely movie."
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,30-Nov-04,"This movie is a delight for those of all ages.I have seen it several times and each time I am enchanted by the characters and magic.The cast is outstanding, the special effects delightful, everything most believable.You have young Harry, a mistreated youth who is ""Just Harry"" to himself. And then, he embarks on a most beautiful adventure to the Hogwarts school.He meets Ron and Hermione, one an adorable mischief maker, the other a very tense and studious young lady.Together, the trio try to set things right in the school.It's the ultimate fantasy for young and old."
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,12-Nov-01,"To millions of children of all ages, November 16 has been more eagerly anticipated than Christmas, as the long-awaited film version of J. K. Rowling's beloved novel ""Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone"" hits the screen.Each of Rowling's four Harry Potter books have been critically acclaimed worldwide best-sellers, turning a generation of video-game playing children into avid readers.In translating Rowling's world of wizards and magic to the screen, the film makers claimed to be intensely aware of the fans' high expectations and had sworn to be faithful to the book.""Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone"" is indeed the most loyal film adaptation of a book that this fan has ever seen.It's the story of an orphaned boy who discovers on his eleventh birthday that his parents were wizards and that he is in fact a famous and powerful wizard himself.Released from the clutches of his desperately ordinary (and non-magical) Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia - and their deliciously obnoxious son Dudley - Harry takes his place in the wizarding world as a first year student at the venerated Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.A great deal of ""Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone"" is an introduction to this fantastic and dangerous world and its richly drawn characters. There's not only a lot of plot to cover in this film, but an entire world to create.At two and a half hours long (hit the restroom before it starts), the film includes the book's most memorable scenes, bringing many of them to life with pure cinematic wizardry.The Quidditch match (a soccer/hockey/rugby thing played on broomsticks) is much more exciting on the screen than on the page, as is the bathroom battle with an enormous mountain troll and the larger-than-life game of wizard's chess.The frightening aspects of the book are in full force in the film, and its PG rating (for some scary moments) should be taken seriously.
Screenwriter Steven Kloves (""Wonder Boys"") has done a fine job of streamlining Rowling's tale while maintaining its spirit. Director Chris Columbus (""Home Alone"") makes good on his promise to be faithful to the book. But at times the film is a bit too reverent; you want the actors to cut loose and have a bit more fun.Columbus clearly understands that fantasy works best when it's played most real. Across the board, his fine ensemble of actors are so perfectly cast that they appear to have literally stepped out of Rowling's book.
In the title role, Daniel Radcliffe pulls off the very difficult task of playing an introverted hero who spends most of the movie reacting to the amazing sights and events around him. He beautifully captures the deep soul and untapped potential of Harry Potter. And when this kid smiles the screen lights up.Rupert Grint is delightful as Harry's sardonic buddy Ron Weasley and Emma Watson nearly steals the film as their overachieving friend Hermione Granger. Three cheers to the film makers for giving three unknown child actors the top billing they deserve.The strong cast of veteran actors includes Richard Harris as the wise Headmaster Dumbledore and Robbie Coltrane as the lovable giant Hagrid. Alan Rickman is wonderfully villainous as Professor Snape and Zoe Wanamaker has just the right touch of girls gym teacher as flying instructor Madame Hooch.
As the strict but just Professor McGonagall, Oscar winner Maggie Smith seems born to play the role - and is ready for another Oscar.John Cleese (as Nearly Headless Nick) and Julie Walters (as Mrs. Weasley) have all-too-brief cameo roles, but if the next film ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" remains true to the book, we'll be seeing more of them.In addition to being highly engaging, the film is a marvelous thing to look at. From the bustling wizard street Diagon Alley to the magnificently gothic Hogwarts School to the dark and misty Forbidden Forest, the film breaks new ground in imaginative production design.To paraphrase the film's tagline, let the magic (and box office records) begin."
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,08-Nov-01,"We live in a world where economics is hard. This forces practical limitations when making a movie. Time and money are sadly finite, cinema owners need to be pleased as well as fans and computer animation ain't perfect. Given these limitations, this film is about as close to human perfection as it is possible to achieve. However, it's extremely clear what an immense challenge it is to turn Philosopher's Stone from book to film.Two and a half hours is not long to explore a wonderful, magical world. Furthermore, the directors have bowed to the inevitable temptation to show us things that cannot be communicated so effectively in a book. The consequence is the feeling of a slightly breathless sprint in places.It also means that the movie has to stay true to the spirit of the book rather than to the letter of it. There are omissions and there are changes. The changes that were made capture and maintain the spirit of the story really well; indeed, there are places where the story is more clearly and straightforwardly told in the movie than in the book. Some aspects of the story are fleshed out on screen and the additions are delightful, completely in keeping with the flavour of the world.The humour of the movie is inevitably more visual than that of the book; no belly laughs, but a lot of smiles. Some punchlines have changed, but the reasons why the jokes are funny remain the same. Not knowing exactly what's coming next is a good thing! It's all kept tasteful, classy and above the belt; there's nothing to cringe about.The voice acting is almost uniformly brilliant. However, there are occasions where some of the actors are required to convey high emotions and are only given a second or two of face shot, or head-and-shoulders shot, to do so. This isn't as much freedom as they need and they fall a little short. The blame here must fall on the decision to give the actors too much to do too quickly, not on the actors themselves.Other than these rare jarring instances, the physical acting is frequently excellent and seldom less than completely adequate, judged against the highest of targets set by the book's clear emotion descriptions.Dan Radcliffe has the look, the mannerisms and the charm of Harry down pat. His strongest expressions are the bemusement that must be inherent at entering a world where science does not rule alone and the bravery that Harry shows in his achievements. Emma Watson possibly slightly overplays Hermione, but does so in a fully endearing fashion. There's one scene which gives her too little chance to truly express panic; otherwise her performance needs no changes.Rupert Grint has comic timing way beyond his years, hitting Ron's lines perfectly. Tom Felton makes a stylish Draco; Matt Lewis' Neville character suffers from the acceleration, so the finale does come as a slight characterisation shock.The Phelps brothers' Fred and George are distinctively cheeky rather than proactive pranksters; Chris Rankin imbues Percy with genuine authority. Sean Biggerstaff shines; his Oliver Wood is likeable and an ideal Quidditch team captain.Robbie Coltrane's Hagrid is the single dominant adult character, with maximum laughs extracted at every step. The movie changes strongly exaggerate one side of Hagrid's nature, though; probably inevitable considering how much plot exposition his character has.David Bradley has a vicious Argus Filch; John Hurt's Ollivander is an eccentric treat, giving a wonderful introduction to the Wizarding World. The professors are uniformly excellent, though Richard Harris' Dumbledore comes off as disappointingly flat until the end.The most ambitious point of the movie is the computer generated imagery. The stills are wonderful, but the fastest animation is restricted by the limitations of real-world technology. The book makes extremely stringent demands of the CGI; sometimes their overall effect in the movie is merely good rather than insanely great. Some of the magic spells and effects look awesome; others don't capture the imagination nearly so much.The world cannot yet completely convincingly animate human beings doing inhuman things, which serves as a clear reminder that you need fictional magic to make the impossible possible. The Quidditch scene is the most demanding of them all; while the sequence is action-packed and good-looking, disappointingly, it's not a total success. Perhaps some of the scenes would have been better with more conventional special effects? (For instance, the lower-tech-looking Sorting Hat scene is one of the most delightful of them all.)The set looks gorgeous. However, it may not stand up to detailed analysis. It's fairly obvious that things are shot in many disparate locations, rather than one big Hogwarts School near Hogsmeade.The score is absolutely wonderful. The soundtrack may rely too heavily on The Famous Bit, but it's clear that the balance and mixture of things in the finished movie are exactly right.The feel of the whole movie is everything fans could have hoped for. The dialogue is intensely measured, the colouring is suitably epic, the selection of what to leave in is really tightly considered. You get chills in your spine at the right places; you feel the triumphs as all-encompassing endorphin highs. It's clear that the production have thought long, hard and lovingly. They are true fans of the story, they are the right people for the job, it all bodes very well for the second film.So it could never have been the film that the hyper-literalists were hoping for, then, but it is as good as the practicalities of the real world could possibly permit. Don't expect miracles and you'll love it. I look forward to watching it again and again.8/10 at the very least. A really satisfactory film!"
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,17-Dec-04,"I watched this movie first time when I was left with no choice. My expectations were extremely low as I always wondered if Harry Potter books were over-hyped. How-ever after watching the movie it did make me a Harry Potter movie fan. And needless to say - this continues to remain my favourite of HP series. That brings to a point here.... the effect of expectations over a movie. True, expectations reduce joy.Without going into the story I would certainly say Chris Columbus churns out a perfect pot-pourri of emotions, suspense and magic, delivering something appealing to all ages.Every character brought to life on screen has done justice and leave an impression on you. Particularly notable performances by Emma Watson and Alan Rickman.CGI are in plenty and made good of. The Quedditch game is picturised amazingly. The wizard's chess is treat to eyes.Let's hope that the forthcoming HP series carries the similar magical touch."
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,10-Nov-01,"When I knew the film was being made, I thought how could they make a film that would be up to the standard of such a perfect book. But they did! Sure they missed bits out but they captured the essence of the book brilliantly. One member of the cast was mis-cast for me but my children disagreed.I even found myself believing they were flying and not wondering ""how are they doing that?"" So 10 out 10 Warner Brothers. Bring on the next one!"
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,26-Dec-17,"There is a major difference between reviews here and this is very easy to explain. Anybody who (like me) has read the books multiple times, knowing the slightest details and loving absolutely everything from the series, can´t be completely happy with the film. For the neutral watcher who read the books maybe once or not even at all this movie must seem like a really entertaining and well directed film. The problem is that though very good acting, especially Alan Rickman as Snape, a beautiful scenery and very good camera work, the most important essentials of the books are pretty much non-existing. For instance, I, as an hardcore fan since the first time reading the books when i was 9, was always extremely interested in reading a passage of a normal school lesson or a normal day at any job of an fully educated wizard, eg in the ministry of magic. Rowling made us have the desire to always experience more of the universe she created. I was always amazed by the lightness and uncomplicated way of Rowlings writing, how she managed to let us accompany Harry in his daily life, making the actually extremely strange and funny way of the magicians life seem so normal and casual for the readers. The film on the other hand is more of a build-up to Harry´s first encounter with Voldemort, a scene that´s perfectly directed with impressive effects and good filming, which is definitely the highlight of as well film and book, with the difference that the book is more focused in describing Harry´s adventrous first year as a whole. The film is a little bit inconsistent in terms of how close it sticks to the book´s plot and this is another problem. Because of the book being so comprehensive and full it is nearly impossible not to skip any sections of the book. In my opinion the screenwriter should have either sticked closer to the book or distanced the filmplot more from it. Another thing i miss is the great dry humour the book is spiced with in a lot of ways. The problem is that this can´t really be translated in the movie because it´s often in the way Rowling describes things and not only in the dialogues. One thing that is awesome is the music. In my opinion John Williams is the best film music composer and the way he captures the mysterious and thrilling atmosphere and the majesty and greatness of Hogwarts is marvelous. At the end I can say that the film can meet the expectations but it´s just not possible to convince a haerdore fan completely, just because while reading the book, everybody creates his own picture of Hogwarts, the characters and the scenery. This is called imagination, it is the best part of reading a book, not possible to be translated completetly satisfyingly into a movie and the reason to my big recommandation concerning Harry Potter and also every other book which is filmed. Read the book first! If you watch the film first and read the books afterwards you´ll miss a great time imagining everything for yourself. And this will come espescially pronounced in the books of Harry Potter."
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,19-Nov-01,"I feel, next to Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is the best book-to-movie adaptation that I've ever seen. The sets were stunning - the actors were first rate - the effects were breathtaking.  The film flowed quite smoothly in it's transition from page to screen, never tripping on the awkward conventions that other books on film have struggled with.   The screenplay, by Steven Kloves, stripped away all unnecessary elements to get to the root of the story.  Though many events from the book were excluded, the essential ones made it to the film. And it makes for one smooth story and very enjoyable movie-going experience.Many kudos to Chris Columbus and the rest of the Harry Potter cast/crew for not turning this movie into what it easily could have become:  a 2 and a half hour commercial advertisement for action figures and collectibles, kid's meals and fast food tie-ins, soft drinks and snack products, etc. and instead focused on bringing J.K. Rowling's story to life as accurately and as lovingly as it deserves.  There has been much speculation on whether Columbus was the correct choice for the first two installments of the series and I say to that, Yes.  I feel that he accomplished what most would have failed.  He has proven, at least to me, that Diagon Alley truly exists - if only I could find the right brick to tap on.  The world of Harry Potter is no longer fantasy to me, but instead a place where any of us mere Muggles could hope to visit, one day.One of my favorite moments, is what I'm going to refer to as the Adrenaline Sequence.  By Adrenaline Sequence, I mean the sequence in a movie that for all intents and purposes, doesn't necessarily propel the story, but gives the audience a huge theatrical payoff, ala the Pod Race sequence in The Phantom Menace.  The Adrenaline Sequence for this particular movie is the Quidditch sequence.  I was very happy to finally see the 'hockey/soccer hybrid on a broomstick' come to life.  The Quidditch Sequence is, by far, my favorite sequence in the whole film.  The scene is dizzying in it's violence and it's one breathless moment after another.  My hat goes off to Columbus and his team for succeeding in making this scene as memorable as it should be.Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a fantastic movie for children of all ages.  Fans and non-fans alike will enjoy this colorful story of good versus evil and the friendships that endure."
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,02-Jan-07,"When I first saw this movie I was ten years old, the same age the characters where supposed to be. My older cousin and her boyfriend took me to the Mall to watch a movie. Back then I wasn't going very often to the cinema, due to the fact that my parents didn't have time and I wasn't old enough to go alone to any theater. The movie captivated my attention like nothing before and I became so interested in anything that had to do with this movie, and I heard that it was made after a book. I didn't had Internet back then, but I found the first book at a library and convinced my mother to buy it. That's how I became obsessed with reading and writing.I may say, ""Harry Potter"" affected me in a positive way, because after I finished reading all the published books back then, I wanted to read more books and I must thank J.K.Rowling for her genius, if it wasn't for her books, I might have been right now an average seventeen year old, at some party, drinking my brains out. This movie got me to the right path in life.I know, you probably don't care about my story, you readers only want to hear about what I thought of the movie, but I believe my story can influence you if you are a parent and thinking whether or not you should let your children watch this film. My advice is yes and I have presented my reason above.The story is simply magical and ""Hogwarts"" is a genius invention. The movie is done well, almost perfect. It's the closest to the book they can get and it's an amazing experience for any kid."
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,25-May-17,"Ah, the first film adaptation of the beloved Harry Potter series. Harry Potter is an 11-year-old boy who comes to find out that he is a wizard. He lives with his uncaring Muggle (non magic) aunt, uncle, and cousin since his parents died when he was a baby. They were murdered by a dark and powerful evil wizard named Lord Voldemort. Harry would be dead too, but was miraculously saved, making him something of a legend. Upon learning of his guarded magic roots, Harry gets enrolled in Hogwarts- a British school for witches and wizards. While there he learns to come into his own, meet people that are actually good to him, and learn more of his dark past. Looking back, I don't know if it was a good idea to have Chris Columbus direct this, as he does have a reputation for being something of a hack, albeit a decent one. I think his direction is okay here. Yeah, retrospectively it could have been better, but it could also have been much worse. At least with him at the helm we get a good amount of whimsy to go along with a bit of menace, and that's a good thing, as the book was likewise not too heavy on the darker stuff (though that sure changed as time went on). Many liberties are taken, which is weird since the book is quite short, and the film is two and a half hours. It does get the point across decently enough though, and also works as a piece for those unfamiliar with the source material. John Williams provides great music, there's wonderful art direction and set design, and there's some nifty set pieces too. Featuring an all-British cast, this film is impeccably cast, and the performances are good too. Finding decent child actors is hard, but they really scored here. My enjoyment of this movie has waned over time, but it's still not a terrible piece of work by any means, so check it out."
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,04-Jul-18,"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is a film directed by Chris Columbus. For many years, I hadn't given a damn about the Harry Potter series. But seeing the fanfare surrounded by the series, I decided to give it a try. After watching this one, I can definitely say that I am on the verge of being a fan.Plot: Harry Potter, an orphan living with his uncle and his family is invited to Hogwarts School of Magic to become a wizard.Story and direction: I had watched this part around the time it released but never just kept in touch since I didn't understand a word. Seeing it now as an adult and a movie lover, I just fell in love with this fictional world created. The characters, settings, story, etc.. all just feel seamless. Thanks to J K Rowling, Steve Kloves and Chris Columbus who have done justice to the source material provided to them. I feel the themes are so very relevant in this film. The intricacies of those themes are valid in the current world we do live in. This is what I just exactly want from any story presented to me. Although the film is very long, I never felt bored for a single moment. And to adapt quite a huge novel comes with responsibility and precaution, which the makers completely justified. The sets are huge and awesome. You just feel you are in Hogwarts actually. Also each characters costume is just to marvel at. John Williams once again just proves why he is the composer of the century. But I did feel some flaws to the film. Being a first film, the main plot of the film comes at around the 90th minute of the film. Also the VFX of the film felt very amateur considering some great VFX was done in the years preceding this film.Performances: I would say that the casting of the film is just perfect. Applause for the casting team is deserved. Never do you feel that another actor should play the role. The kids, Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, Tom Felon just to name a few are fantastic. These 10-11 year old just steal your heart. Also the other cast like Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltrane make themselves likable.Favorite Scene: There were many favourite scenes in this film for me. But one scene in particular was the troll scene where Harry and Ron decide to save Hermione and after the saving Hermione vouches for the boys. This is the scene where you actually happen to see the bond solidified between the 3 as friends.Verdict: For anyone who just loves fantasy film and worlds with great visuals, this film is just for you. I assure you won't be disappointed. I plan on seeing the entire series now because I am fascinated by this world and want to see what else has it got to offer.I am going with an 8/10."
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,18-Dec-01,"HARRY POTTER / (2001) *** (out of four)Here's a method of evaluating a movie based on previously published material: ask yourself if the film makes you want to read the material from which it is based?  Before the release of ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,"" I was one of the few remaining souls who had not read J.K. Rowling's fantasy book series. After screening the first film installment, I did want to read the book. Borrowing the novel from a family member, I briefly skimmed over the chapters. The book's intelligence and similarities with the film really surprised me.  With over 100 million copies sold in over 46 different languages, J.K. Rowling's best-selling series of books has become a worldwide phenomenon. Naturally, with soaring expectations abound, the filmmakers felt great pressure to create a faithful adaptation. They have. This film is essentially a visualization of the words in the novel, with very few differences. That said, the film does run into a few conflicts with the book's story. The middle of the movie has nowhere to go. It's like a false second act; almost nothing of major significance occurs in this period of the film. The young characters wander from scene to scene with nothing much to do and nothing much to say. We're left with a grand display of eye-popping special effects.
""Harry Potter"" certainly dazzles us with a solid beginning and an engaging final act, however. We first meet a young wizard boy named Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe). Soon after the film opens, the boy discovers he has magical powers. He's then thrust into an enchanting world of sorcery, magic, and witchcraft. He's sent to a school for young wizard children, where he meets new friends, learns about magic, and participates in fun competitions. But someone at the school doesn't like Harry, as mysterious events begin to occur. Harry soon finds himself in the middle of a diabolical scheme of revenge. Who is the culprit and what do they want with Harry?
The film asks some involving questions. Too bad it doesn't give enough depth to the side characters or subplots. We don't really care about the mystery because we don't know enough about the suspects. The movie does conclude with a twist, but it doesn't encourage another examination of the movie. It lacks a foundation altogether. The story spends so much time foreshadowing the villain's identity, it is pointless for the story to abandon its proceeding plot points and develop a new villain at the end. The book gets away with this; the movie does not. After his gentle ""Home Alone"" and sweet-natured ""Stepmom,"" many questioned the ability of director Chris Columbus to bring a sense of darkness to the story-and for good reason. ""Harry Potter"" contains charming, likable characters and a rich pallet of lush, inventive images. Unfortunately, the film lacks an edge. It's missing the dark atmosphere Rowling's novel so vividly brought to life. Columbus does construct some memorable sequences, but the individual scenes themselves are much better than the movie as a whole.Despite it's childish story and pre-teen characters, many define ""Harry Potter"" as a film for all ages. While that's debatable, during my screening, adults were plowing through the isles every five minutes. Going to the bathroom? Getting drink refills? Buying concessions? Who knows? But not a single child budged from their seat. Their eyes were glued to the big screen. Conclusion: It's a sure-fire experience for children, especially if they've read the books. But adults may not encounter the same enticement as kids. Then again, if I had nothing better to do than to count the people leaving the theater, why am I recommending the film?"
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,26-Mar-20,"I watched all Harry Potter movies when I was 7 years old. After five years I watched the movies again at 12 years old and I feel this saga a classic, well, it is a classic. I started reading the first book like one day ago. Which my mom gave to me when I was a little kid. I like Harry Potter a lot and I would watch all the saga again"
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,17-Mar-19,"Harry Potter movies are one of my favorite ones, and I can watch them several times. I watch it every time it's on TV, and there is one channel that shows all the series of this incredible movie every time after the new year. I also want to mention that even my family members like to watch it with me. My grandmother especially likes it. This fact indicates that this movie is interesting not only for children but also for elderly people and it's not weird for me. There are so many things going on in this movie, so many secrets and beautiful scenes. Plus a big thanks for the graphics of the movie, everything is very realistic. For example, the mermaids or the dinosaurs. Moreover, there is a massive animatronic creature in this movie- spider and after watching the movie google about it and found out that Rupert Grint, the actor who plays Ron Weasley, one of the main characters, is afraid of spiders just s much as his character is, and said it was easily the scariest scenes to film. I'm scared of spiders too, and I know how it feels when you see them. Thus, I really appreciate the job that this actor did. In my opinion, despite the fact that he had to play again a guy, who was scaring from spiders, it is again hard to play the role by looking at the creature that gives you goosebumps. Thus, this movie not only good in graphics, but also the cast."
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,17-May-10,"First episode also known as ¨Harry Potter and the philosopher's stone¨ deal with Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe)and friends fighting dark forces in an amazing adventure . In this early installment of JK Rowling saga, our protagonist is freed by Rubeus from the custody of his selfish uncle (Richard Griffiths) and miserable aunt (Fiona Lewis). Harry goes his destiny at Hogwart's school , there meets our friends Ron(Rupert Grint) ,Hermione(Emma Watson) and his enemies Braco Malfoy(Tom Felton), along the dark forces which threatens Hogwart, and finally Lord Voldemor . Besides the professors as Minerva(Maggie Smith), Severus Snape(Alan Rickman), Dumbledore ( Richard Harris), Madame Hooch (Zoe Wanamaker), Quirinus (Ian Hart)and of course Rubeus(Robbie Coltrane). Here some legendary events take place , including a Quiddich match, and Harry Potter competes in confronting in series of dangerous happenings , challenging monsters as unicorn, centaur and horrible creatures and an ending spooky climatic battle .This episode contains loads of adventures and action and is such deeply riveting and emotional as its followings , furthermore gets lots of bombastic special effects and several images have you on the edge of your seat including an amazing array of technical bizarre creatures, a breathtaking ogre ,a three-head animal , and Potter fighting creepy , scary monsters and an exciting final taking on between Harry and the Dark Lord and his henchmen . The picture displays stimulating action set pieces illuminating the full-blown adventures , blending wizardry, witchcraft, horror, humor and is extremely amusing and pretty enjoyable. Darkest even that subsequent chapters is thrilling, dramatic, touching and very exciting. Provide enough amusement to keep the chat rooms humming until the epic ending comes out . In spite of overlong runtime, it suffers from over-length, and the difficult of adapting, the film still managing to keep a quick enough pace for those unfamiliar with the literary and highly detailed work by J. K. Rowling. The motion picture is splendidly filmed with sensational production design and colorful cinematography by John Seale . Phenomenal and spectacular music by master John Williams. The movie is magnificently directed by Chris Colombus . The film is for Harry Potter saga lovers as well as neophyte who have never read J. K. Rowling novels. The follow-up titled ¨Harry Potter and the goblet of fire¨ verse pretty much the same at the first one ."
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,17-Sep-16,"in 2001, in the film Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, began one of the best sagas of all time, based on the book of the same name by JK Rowling, the film hit full in the cast, all actors are great in their characters, Daniel Radcliffe this impeccable as Harry Potter, the resemblance is too large, Rupert Grint this great as Ron Weasley, Emma excellent Watson as Hermione Granger, Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid, Richard Harris as Dumbledore (which unfortunately from the third movie substituted series, having deceased), Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman great as Snape, Ian Hart, Tom Felton, and etc, all goods, the special effects are great, the picture is great, especially the castles, the soundtrack is very good, and full of great moments, as the final, obvious that the movie has errors, the script has some problems, and the film is very long, I think it was longer than it should, and the film is faithful to the book, even with some missing characters, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a very good film, and marks the beginning of the saga of the Wizard in the movies. Note 8.2"
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,14-Aug-16,"Like a lot of others, I refused to watch this film when it was originally released, thinking it was going to be another movie for kids, loosely taken from the source. Was I ever wrong? J.K. Rowling's novel was brilliantly taken from book to screen. The acting, directing and especially the special effects were tremendously awesome. Director Chris Columbus did a superb job with the direction, I was surprised he didn't get an Academy Award nomination. The acting was too, excellent, especially from the experienced actors like Alan Rickman playing Severus Snape. Truly one of his best performances.A great adaptation of a very popular book, a fine example of cinema."
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,05-Nov-01,"Before I entered the cinema I was a little worried that the book may have been picked up and messed around with by the Hollywood machine and the film pushed out the end, But to my amazement they have kept almost the same. Several little bits were missing, like the absence of the poltergeist which I thought may have been quite fun. But a mystic magical adventure not to be missed!"
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,14-Apr-20,While I look back on this first entry into the Harry Potter series fondly it is not with out a few problems with adaption from the books. Our trio of main actors are very young and as a result we get plently of chessey acting. Looking back however it is great too see the beginning roots of the characters that we get very attached too through out the series. We get too see them grow as actors. A great cast was put together that stayed more or less the same through out the whole franchise. The effects in the movie are handled well for its time despite Harry not actually using any magic. Even though there are better movies in the series I will always look forward to watching this entry.
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,16-Aug-19,"I watch this movie again in 2019, because i think it was an amazing movie n i miss the point of the movie when i watch it as a child. I only focusing on the magic thing.
Its good for a children to watch this movie i think, it tells not only about friendship, but also family, bravery and sincerity.
Watching this also makes me remember my childhood days, it bring back all memories i cherish the most.
really love it"
Uncut Gems,27-Dec-19,"That was INTENSE. Decided to watch this after seeing this film pop up on so many ""2019 Top 10 movies"" lists and I couldn't be happier that I did. Adam Sandler absolutely killed it in this, I kept feeling confused at the choices he made but at the same time felt sorry for him.That ending game though... my palms were sweaty and I was on the edge of my seat waiting to see if it was going to end badly like most gambling movies do. I was extremely surprised to see him win his bet thinking ""wow this movie actually is going to have a happy ending"" but oh boy was I SHOCKED when Sandler unlocked that door... my jaw was on the ground.Only thing keeping it from a 10 is the ending felt incomplete. What's his family going to think and what's his side piece gonna do once she came back to his dead corpse. Either way this movie was amazing.Edit: wow did not expect so much hate on this film after reading other reviews... not to mention it looks like users here are fishing out positive reviews and marking them all as ""non helpful"". I don't know about those bad reviewers but any movie that has me at a lost for words and a pounding heart rate for that long deserves a spot high up on my list..."
Uncut Gems,31-Jan-20,"All reviews here are correct. The good ones and the bad ones. This movie is a mess and you can like it or hate. My wife hated it, I liked it very much."
Uncut Gems,01-Jun-20,"""His character was unlikable."" ""It's too loud."" ""It's tiring/stressful to watch.""
I fail to see anything of value in any of these critiques. If anything it proves that the director got exactly the response he wanted. It was tiring and loud and stressful and even now after watching it my blood pressure is high and my neck is taught with nerves, but that's literally the point. Not every film has to center on a conventionally attractive hero progressing towards his goal after a setback and consequently fixing whatever romantic issues they had. One of the moments that made me love this film even more was Howey's attempt to reconcile with his wife at Passover. For just a moment, they roped me into believing that this could be the classic Sandler movie turning point, where he grows as a person in some way and his significant other takes him back. He didn't get this chance here and I love the director for that. Instead of the generic turn around story, we got to see a natural end to his destructive tendencies. It may not be the feel good experience you went to the movies for, but that doesn't make it bad. I think watching at home is a good choice though. I had to take a break in the middle of the film, and that likely made all the difference in my ability to enjoy it."
Uncut Gems,16-Sep-19,"Saw this at TIFF. From front to back, this movie might be most stressful thing I've ever seen. I was a huge fan of Good Time and this movie ramps the intensity to an even higher level. Sandler's performance is great. It just shows that time after time, if he's working with a good director(s), a strong supporting cast, and an interesting concept, he will absolutely crush it. Also what other movie could have ""people watching sports"" be the most exhilarating part of the story?I also loved that the score (Daniel Lopatin aka Oneohtrix Point Never) is used super strategically to build discomfort, especially when it swells to drown out the dialogue.Looking forward to watching this again when it gets a wide release in December."
Uncut Gems,15-Sep-19,"It has been a fascinating ride watching the numerous ups and downs of Adam Sandler's career. From classic comedies like Happy Gilmore to great dramatic performances like Reign Over Me, he has proven time and time again that he is a very talented guy. The problem is that he has let himself fall out of the spotlight over the last ten years, simply due to the fact that he has been choosing some of the worst films of each year, on multiple occasions. In what might be the greatest performance he has ever given, Uncut Gems is his latest role that will be released this fall. After viewing this at the Toronto International Film Festival and giving it a little time to sink in, I can confidently say that this will end up being one of my favourite films of 2019 by year's end.Following a jewelry store owner in Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler) as he gets his hands on a precious gemstone from Ethiopia, he decides to lend it to an NBA star in good faith. What sadly becomes apparent is the fact that he has many issues under the surface. Being a really shady figure and having a serious gambling addiction ends up giving this movie an insane amount of tension. This is a roller coaster ride of claustrophobia and I couldn't get enough of it.Directors Benny and Josh Safdie have been quietly building a solid little career for themselves. Having worked on very small indie projects like Heaven Knows What and then one of 2017s very best movies in Good Time, they're truly a duo that this industry needs. Their creativity always leaps off the screen in a way that feels very different from other filmmakers working today. This is a movie that heavily relies on pacing, editing, and performances. With a screenplay that requires nearly every performer to constantly be in motion or talking over one another, this movie barely gives you a second to catch a breath.By the time the third act begins, you'll probably wonder why you have been so invested in Sandler's portrayal of Howard because he's really not the best person. With that said, it's the fact that he is a terrible person deep down and is so greedy that is what made it so engaging and unnerving at times. With the use of periodic psychedelic imagery, a pulse-poundingly superb score, and a slew of uberly talented performers, Uncut Gems is a movie that states from the very beginning that it's a contender for the upcoming awards season.Overall, some viewers will absolutely wonder what the point of the movie was, due to the nature of how the final few minutes play out, but it was precisely these final moments that took me off guard and had me loving it even more. Personally, I feel that audiences have become impatient with films these days and anything over an hour and a half may seem like a chore to them if they're not completely on board, so that's why I would recommend this movie. It's not short, but the way this movie is put together makes it fly by. I believe this movie can be appreciated by many viewers. Uncut Gems is easily one of the years best films."
Uncut Gems,28-Dec-19,"They should hand out high-grade blood pressure meds to people going to see this after it ends. The major strength and in a way the slight weakness of Uncut Gems is how laser-focused the Safdies are in conveying total anxiety, stress and mania through this extreme act of full cinema SOUND (levels of acting and over-lapping dialog, that Vangelis-Blade-Runner-on-Steroids/Crystal Meth score, some of the cinematography and the tracking of the camera).I do wish there was a little more than just flourishes of relief, though I'd be lying if I said Sandler was anything but exceptional and riveting playing degenerate crumbling right before our eyes. While Eric Bogosian, Lakeith Stanfield and Kevin Garnett and many others here are natural solid, it's Sandler's show, and it's soulful and tense and harrowing and ultimately (as terrible as Howard can be) tragic. The filmmakers's greatest achievement from the looks of this and Good Time is finding star-actors who aren't known for their wide range and getting career-triumph work from them. If the movie isn't all that complex, I do think Howard is and that helps make this pretty special as a depiction of addiction, more than anything else. It's got grit and style to burn, which is mostly fine by me."
Uncut Gems,23-Dec-19,"UNCUT GEMS (2019). First things first. This is not an ""Adam Sandler movie"". Yes, he is the star and the focus of the advertising, but, this is very much a ""Safdie Brothers film"". Emphasis on ""film"". Benny and Josh Safdie are very much in love with the look and feel of the films of the 70s and 80s, in particular. But, as with GOOD TIME, they are not interested in doing a cutesy wink-wink homage. It's in their bones.
Sandler plays Howard, New York city jeweler who's also a full-time hustler. His marriage to Dinah (Idina Menzel) is falling apart, his gambling debts are piling up and he is facing health issues. He banks his future on an Ethiopian rock which houses the title valuables. Also involved are a two-bit floozy he's carrying on with (Julia Fox) and Boston Celtics legend Kevin Garnett - playing himself.
From the get-go, the Safdie Brothers (who also co-wrote with Ronald Bonstein) bring enormous energy and drive to the proceedings. Sandler starts at 11 and goes from there. Similarly, Daniel Lopatin's score is often mixed so high it becomes intrusive at times (the synth music itself isn't bad, sort of a retro blend of Vangelis and Jean-Michel Jarre). Darius Khondij's 35mm photography is both slick and gritty.
Director Yorgos Lanthimos (THE FAVOURITE) has remarked that UNCUT GEMS is like ""a Robert Altman film that was dipped in acid."" Altman's 1974 CALIFORNIA SPLIT certainly fits the time period and some of the themes. Of course, Altman was an original and as many of his admirers have found out over the years, overlapping dialogue and naturalistic atmosphere do not alone make an ""Altman film"" (Altman himself often enough failed to create the unique mood). UNCUT GEMS works because of the filmmaking brio and Sandler's driven performance. Still, at times, it seems to be trying too hard. It works best in the last act when the Safdies let the drama play out more. It's a good film, even if not quite up to GOOD TIME. But, hey, Celtics fans now know how Boston beat Philadelphia in that 2012 Playoff series!"
Uncut Gems,21-Dec-19,"I am pretty sure this would be an Oscar nod for Sandler.
One thing I can say for sure is that I have never been a Sandler fan. I have deliberately avoided his movies all along - I never liked him on SNL.
But boy did he break all my perceptions of him in this gem!
This is not a movie to watch in cinema for sure. Watch it at leisure at home with possibly taking a break or two in between. It is intense and will draw you in."
Uncut Gems,26-Dec-19,"I went into this film with fairly high hopes for it. Yeah, those hopes died about ten minutes in. Everyone is yelling in practically every scene, and there's a strange, vaguely 80's sounding soundtrack blaring in every scene. The first two acts are a mess, though the third act is a bit easier to follow, but ultimately doesn't offer all that much of a story. So, to sum it up, I'd rather watch 'Billy Madison' while getting dental work done than this trainwreck of a film."
Uncut Gems,17-Dec-19,"How is this even a movie? For starters, who's idea was it to have a constant loud, atrocious, out-of-place and annoying score in almost every second of this film. Then putting a bunch of loud people in one room yelling, ignoring each other and talking nonsense, and call it a movie. This is the garbage daily workplace stress people want to avoid, not watch expecting to be entertained, but instead resort to drinking to settle down watching this stressful convoluted mess of nothingness. What was even the point of the traditional dinner with still non-stop annoying loudness and useless chatter? I get the writers are novice/newbs, but at least have a seasoned writer proofread this mess before it goes to action and viewers watch stunned for 135 mins wondering what they're watching, only to get a stupid ending. 4/10 all going to Sandlers great performance"
Uncut Gems,28-Dec-19,"Wtf is this? Why the high ratings?
It's 135 min of pure noise!"
Uncut Gems,28-Mar-20,"This film is essentially 2 hours of people shouting and swearing at each other. Sandler plays the role surprisingly well, but the characters are difficult to like and the storyline starts off difficult to follow and then fades into nothing. The ending is lazy. Just not a good film."
Uncut Gems,09-Feb-20,"The plot largely consists of Adam Sadler yelling at the TV / being yelled at / others yelling, transporting goods / money around and yelling at people / things again.
The whole movie is set up to stress you out as much as possible, which whilst quite a feat is also deeply unpleasant.
Found it pretty indulgent and unpleasant tbh.
Good acting though, in-between all the yelling."
Uncut Gems,09-Feb-20,The first 15 mins are just pure mess with characters yelling over each other and horrible music in background. The whole story doesnt even make sense at all. At the end you are happy that is finally over.
Uncut Gems,03-Jan-20,"The only interesting thing about this movie was the constant high stress levels. Other than than, garbage story which ended meaningless. I'd rather watch Adam Sandler's cheesy comedy movies that this."
Uncut Gems,21-Jan-20,"Uncut Gems was every bit as thrilling and chaotic as it seems was intended. The shouting dialogue and impulsive plot kept me on the edge of my seat, but the entire thing felt one note until the very end. I certainly wasn't bored, but I don't think this was a roller coaster I truly enjoyed."
Uncut Gems,15-Feb-20,"Really annoying! Everyone keeps yelling in the whole film, a lot of scenes make no sense. I don't know how this can be called a film and got this high rating. Unbelievable"
Uncut Gems,25-Apr-20,"45 minutes was all I could bear, that was more than enough, 45 minutes of shouting, poor direction, ridiculous script, annoying soundtrack, terrible acting. Anybody who rates this movie seriously needs to have a long hard serious look at themselves.
I carnt believe Scorsese had any involvement in this shambolic episode
ABSOLUTELY DIRE"
Uncut Gems,21-Jan-20,"I have only walked out of one other movie in my life. I was trying to stick it out through very chaotic and gritty scenes hoping that the movie would get better. 20 minutes into the movie, my husband said, it better get better than this or we should just go home. Sad to say, we made it about an hour in still hoping.This movie was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. You don't want to root for any of these characters. They all seem pretty horrible as people. There is no humor. The movie has a lot of chaos, which creates almost an anxious feeling, and it just because people are constantly yelling or obnoxious.I didn't enjoy anything about it and left, wasting $20 because watching reruns on tv was the better option."
Uncut Gems,11-Feb-20,"This movie on of weirdest movies that I have ever watched .. Sometimes you feel it's great and hopefull then after 5 seconds you feel the movie fkd up and go to wrong way with loud shouting and screaming .. It deserves 6/10
By the way Adam sandler was great in drama he should leave comedy for a while and focus on drama now"
Uncut Gems,10-Feb-20,I literally can't think of a worse movie than this one.Nonstop Screaming. Nonstop chaos. Nonstop fighting.I'd rather be at the DMV for 10 years than live through watching this garbage again.
Uncut Gems,18-Mar-20,"I couldn't even make it all the way through. The entire plot is just Howard trying to get back the stupid opal and constantly being around. The last straw for me was when KG and his crew were trying to get into the shop and the door wouldn't open. It was like a horror movie where the car doesn't start at the worst possible time even though it had previously started every other time. It added nothing to the story and only served to annoy. Does he get the opal back? I don't even care anymore. I'm sure he gets beat up at least once more and I'm sure there are other opportunities where it just slips through his fingers yet again. But worst of all, it doesn't even matter. His character is completely unlikeable. You don't even want him to get it back. There is nothing redeemable at all about the guy. You're not rooting for him. But you're not rooting against him either. He's not really a villain. He's just a scheming scumbag that you won't care about. I certainly didn't which is why I bailed out halfway through."
Uncut Gems,08-Jul-20,"Sandler is a good actor and pulls off the non-comedy role - but what a sad depressing film. Yeah, yeah - certain reviewers will give this positive reviews because of ""realism and depth"". I call BS - why watch a movie about a train wreck main character that continues to denigrate throughout the movie. There are enough true life problems in the world - don't want to spend my entertainment time not being entertained.If you are down and want to be depressed - this movie is for you."
Uncut Gems,14-Feb-20,"Not worth your time. Total waste of your time,. Movie is a mess"
Uncut Gems,05-Jan-20,This was so disappointing. Ratings were high so went. Nothing redeeming here. Bad story so-so acting. Adam Sandler should stick to comedy.
Pride & Prejudice,06-Nov-05,"before i start, i would like to say this. i can read, have read the book, and i read the title of the movie before watching, as should you all. quite disappointed in all the pompous idiots filled with prejudice about the movie.I know that another version of the well-mined Jane Austen classic would need to be brilliant indeed. Such diverse and beautifully written characters and such a delightful plot, so deeply rooted in a profound understanding of human nature, are timelessly attractive to directors, actors and audiences alike. So give them a break. you couldn't do any better.Lets start with Mr Darcy. Darcys embodied by Olivier, Firth and now Matthew McFadyen bring differently significance to enjoy in the proud and socially awkward leading male role. Where Olivier and Firth gave us an aloof, arrogant Darcy encased rigidly in a shell so impenetrable it was almost impossible to believe he had been moved by Lizzie's sardonic criticisms or attracted by her spirited independence, McFadyen shows a more accessible Darcy. He's vulnerable, even fragile behind his stiff manners. His aloofness is more believably from social inadequacy than arrogance, yet he is believably constrained by his social standing to regard decorum, fortune and propriety in a wife's family as significant in his choice of a bride. His capitulation to Lizzie is therefore more believable.Similarly Garson, Ehle and Keira Knightley illustrate the lively intelligence, sharp-minded wit and wry humour of Elizabeth Bennet in equally shining ways that nevertheless bring out different aspects of the character. Keira Knightly's performance as Elizabeth Bennett is by far her best, as she sparkles in this role.The two have a chemistry that i had yet to see on the big or small screen - one that mirrors real life romances. the dislike on both accounts is obvious, watching it grow to love was beautiful and stunning. the love story is heart-felt and sweetly, deeply affecting to a level that modern romantic comedies rarely achieve. I found this movie to be a a richly photographed, memorable ensemble production in which the romance is predominant over the drama but does not eclipse it. though my one disappointment - the ending?! of course i wanted to see them kiss, who didn't? but the shots of them arguing in the rain, and as they draw close with the sunlight shining between them was breathtaking.Giving due significance to the rural environment which plays such an important part in the story, the cinematography captures wide frames of soft, misty fields, copses and winding country roads as an environment which underscores the gentle manners and passionately beating hearts beneath empire gowns and ruffled shirts. The surroundings both detract from the humans and function as appropriately natural settings for the dramas of human nature.Keira Knightley's swan-like Elizabeth moves with energy and grace, hotly opinionated and profoundly moved by principles and prejudices, and magnetically drawn by the seeming arrogance, reticence and gallant behaviour, finally revealed, of Mr Darcy. For two centuries Elizabeth Bennet has been a heroine much admired for her self-contained independence within a culture more conditioned to female submissiveness. Knightley's portrayal is true to the original.All in all, i must give this movie 5 stars, 10 out of 10, 100 % brilliance. The story itself, the characters, the actors, everything that was in the movie 'bewitched me body and soul'. i have never been more moved by a movie, especially not one where i found it to be as hilarious as it was moving."
Pride & Prejudice,04-Oct-05,"A ""modernised"" version of Jane Austen's classic novel that should not be compared unfavourably with 1940 Hollywood Olivier / Garson version nor several BBC serials culminating in the most acclaimed TV series version from 1995 with Colin Firth & Jennifer Ehle-a personal favourite. This 2005 film clocks in 127 minutes (UK / Europe)& 135 minutes (USA & Canada) -the extended version allowing audiences to share more of the timeless love story with the main characters -Elizabeth Bennet & Mr Darcy. Director Joe Wright plus his screenwriters ( Oscar winner Emma Thompson contributed to the final screenplay) have chosen to emphasise Elizabeth Bennet / Mr Darcy plus Jane Bennet/ Mr Bingley story lines & reduce Mr Wickman, Charlotte & Mr Collins to supporting characters.Austen's famous wit,satire & humour that forms the basis for her enduring appeal (Pride & Prejudice was finally published in 1813 & continues as an annual bestseller)is sidelined to open up this version as more emotional drama for modern audiences.If you are open to a newer interpretation, can avoid comparisons to the nearly 5 hour 1995 TV version which allowed for greater depth & detail in telling all the characters story lines & accept some of the new film's rushed story lines-you are in for a treat .....New British star Keira Knightley (Elizabeth Bennet))excels in her first real leading actress role ably supported by fellow Brit Rosamund Pike (Jane Bennet) as the sisters supportive of each other's & their Bennett family problems.Knightley at 20 is the right age for her character,this allows Elizabeth's girlish personality plus her character's pride, misjudgements & loving nature to shine through....Great star turns from Brenda Blethyn as their mother Mrs Bennet plus Oscar winner Judi Dench as fearsome Lady De Bourgh (Mr Darcy's aunt)add depth to this film version.Claudie Blakley as Elizabeths's wise friend Charlotte Lucas & Simon Wood's amusing Mr Bingley are delightful supporting performers. One major surprise is Canadian actor Donald Sutherland's touching performance as Mr Bennet -capturing both the humour of living in an all female household & five daughters to look after with the poignancy of seeing his eldest children's difficult relationships develop -easily his best acting performance in years. In the difficult role of Mr Darcy rising British star Matthew Macfadyen (BBC's Spy series Spooks & Award winning New Zealand film ""In My Father's Den"" rises to the occasion.With the short running time, there is not enough time to allow Darcy's repressed & prejudiced personality to be fully represented -Macfadyen perfectly displays Darcy's social & class problems, his unfortunate attempts at gaining Eliabeth Bennet's interest & his painful adjustments to achieve their personal love story.Macfayden & Knightley's objectionable first dance,their embarrassingly moving Collins House meeting,the unexpected Pemberley encounter plus their two proposal scenes are highlights of this film. Engaging acting performances with wondrous film photography,film locations at some of United Kingdom's most famous stately homes, marvellous film sets & costumes plus one of 2005's best original music scores add greatly to this new film version. All in all one of the better films of 2005 -not perfect film making and not intended to be as subtle as Austen's novel -but a wonderful surprise with some changes to present a modern version of Pride & Prejudice for current audiences -do see this film as & when it is released worldwide....And after seeing the film or re-visiting 1995 BBC TV series -read the original novel for its classic storyline, memorable characters & Austen's brilliant writing style,wit & humour.....9 Out Of 10 for this different interpretation of an enduring classic"
Pride & Prejudice,17-Nov-05,"Jane Austen's tale of love and economics reaches us once more with the energy of a thorough novelty. ""Pride and Prejudice"" has been a favorite novel of mine since I first read it and I've seen Laurence Olivier and Greer Garson, Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle and now Matthew MacFadyen and Kiera Knightly. Amazingly enough I've never been disappointed. The material seems to be full proof. Colin Firth's Darcy, in many ways, is the Darcy I've always imagined. He's been an actor I've followed feverishly since his glorious Adrian LeDuc in ""Apartment Zero"", Matthew MacFadyen was totally new to me but he managed to create that sense of longing that makes that final pay off so satisfying. Kiera Knightly is a ravishing revelation. I must confess, I didn't remotely imagined that she was capable of the powerful range she brilliantly shows here. The other big surprise is Joe Wright, the director, in his feature film debut which is more than promising, it's extraordinary. The photography, the art direction and the spectacular supporting cast, in particular Donald Sutherland and Brenda Blethyn, makes this new version of a perennial classic a memorable evening at the movies"
Pride & Prejudice,11-Nov-05,"Outstanding ... MacFadyen is a worthy Darcy and a darned good actor to boot! The scenery, backgrounds, and country folk were much more realistic than previous versions. The costumes and hairdos also seemed in keeping with the times. Another great addition is the priceless Donald Sutherland who, in a perfect world, would have had more scenes with Judy Densch. If those two can't chew up the scenery, nobody can. And, finally, Keira Knightly is a jewel. Her beauty is so apparent that it almost detracts from the fact that this is a very good actress who can hold her own in any room. This was a delight and I only wish that it could have been 6 hours long."
Pride & Prejudice,18-Nov-05,"While I will say first off, that no movie production ever made will ever equal a novel, especially one of this magnitude, this movie is very well done. I read many reviews going either way, but I must say I enjoyed the film very much. Many are quick to criticize Mac's performance saying he didn't do a good job. I thought he was fine, but believe me he is no Colin. Keira Knightley was absolutely incredible in the film, I would go as far to say it is her breakout performance. Donald Sutherland was amazing, but as can be expected from him. Judi, like always is incredible at her role as Lady Catherine.If you are a complete avid fan of the book as I am, you may or may not like it. My only complaint was that it was in fact short, but then again it is quite hard to make a 370+ page novel into a two hour movie easily. There is a phenomenal display of acting by the entire cast, and the score is perfect.One warning though, the movie concentrates on the love story more than Austen's satire of society, so many Austen fans may be angry with that. But overall I thought it was a great film."
Pride & Prejudice,04-Aug-06,"The fantastic romantic world of Jane Austen again makes its way to the silver screen in Joe Wright's new adaptation of the classic novel Pride and Prejudice. It is the first feature film to be adapted from it in 65 years, and believe me when I say it does not disappoint. This adaptation is, for lack of a better word, a BRILLIANT achievement that keeps you actively involved from the first scene to the very last scene, just about consuming you with aching romance  and it is sprinkled with humour and intelligence.Still taking place in the late 1700s and still interweaving its story with timeless emotion, pride, narrow-mindedness and love, Pride and Prejudice (2005) zooms in on the Bennet household in class-conscious, stuck-up England. In this household, we follow five spirited sisters under the idealism of their overbearing mother (a superbly neurotic Brenda Blethlyn providing for the comic relief) who desperately wants them all to marry and thereby secure the future of the family estate. But the standout sister and protagonist in the film, Lizzie (Keira Knightley) is clever enough to have other ideas, but alas too romantic to carry them out... *sigh*When reviewing period films such as this one, one often focuses on the setting and costume design. I believe this is done because they are often better crafted than the actual story. But in Pride and Prejudice (2005), the stormy emotions of its charactersbottled up but bubbling to get outcompletely consume the entire film and places understated set designs in the backseat. Only when it was consciously put forward, like when Lizzie Bennet was admiring the beautiful architecture and Greek statues of Mr. Darcy's estate, did I ever notice the background  and it was, of course, extraordinary. A similar state displaying the dynamics of its central cast should be attributed to the grand dancing scene between Lizzie and Mr. Darcy  the two are so absorbing that when Wright purposely fades out the the rest of the dancing crowd, you do not notice a change. Your eyes are still solely Knightley and Macfadyen. It took me three viewings to realise this. As for acting performances then, the unspeakably lovely Keira Knightley has finally done it. She has proved me wrong with a truly Oscar-worthy performance and she does it without crying, worrying, moping and sighing like the other nominees that year. Knightley is in fact all about sweet subtlety here, bringing a fantastic presence to her high-spirited character Lizzie. She is the type of character that every girl and woman in the world can identify with and with Knightley behind her to give her oomph, you will not find a more likable creature in films this year. MacFayden is completely satisfactory as Lizzie's love interest Mr. Darcy, but he is no Colin Firth  lacking in charm and is a bit too wooden. But no matter, because these two have the best on-screen chemistry I have ever seen. I'm not kidding, this was sensational. Such magnetism. It is highlighted from scene 1, playfully touching upon their sexual tension and gradually turning it into feverish love that sends chills down your spine.Every last actor in the cast of Pride and Prejudice (2005) gets to shine in their characterfrom Dame Judi Dench as a cold rich lady to Donald Sutherland as caring Mr Bennet, all except Jena Malone whose all too Valley-girl American attitude was distracting and annoyingly anachronistic. But it is Knightley who is in focus and who propels the film with her warm charisma. It is impossible not to fall in love with the main characters, and I say this as someone who avoids romance-themed films and who does not care for period films. This is a truly timeless story and this film will hopefully be remembered, celebrated and praised for breathing life into it with such passion.10/10 (which is a rare grade for me)"
Pride & Prejudice,12-Sep-05,"Having watched a slew of special effects-laden trailers before this film I was reassured to discover that in the brave new world of CGI cinema there is still a place for a satisfyingly romantic story, well-acted and thoughtfully scripted and directed. Comparisons with the highly-regarded 1995 BBC series are inevitable, but whereas that production had the luxury of time to unfold its plot and characters at leisure, the creators of this film had the unenviable task of reducing Jane Austen's book to just two hours. Yes, Austen lovers will mourn the absence or alteration of favourite scenes. Yes, we do lose some sense of the developing and changing relationships between the main characters (two examples - Wickham appears in only two scenes of any significance and personally I would have liked more time to savour Lizzie and Darcy's rediscovery of one another at Pemberley). Yes, there is occasionally a feeling of entering or leaving a scene partway through (where do Lizzie's uncle and aunt think she has gone when she apparently sets off from Pemberley to walk to Lambton without a word to them?) On the whole though, I think director Joe Wright, and screenwriter Deborah Moggach, are successful in retaining the flavour, the vital essence of Austen's original. The film also offers some new perspectives on very familiar characters. Tom Hollander in particular, gives Mr. Collins something approaching dignity in his determined but usually unsuccessful attempts to ingratiate himself with those more powerful than him, and he provides some of the funniest moments of the film  witness his attempts to gain Mr. Darcy's attention at the ball. Mrs. Bennet too, who we all remember Alison Steadman playing with an enthusiasm approaching pantomime, is more sympathetic in the hands of Brenda Blethyn because we understand more clearly the reasons behind her desperation to marry her daughters off. Mr. Bingley though teeters a fine line between nervous hesitancy and simple-minded idiocy which made me question why Jane Bennet would ever consider marrying him. And who on earth thought of giving him Cameron Diaz's infamous ""There's Something About Mary"" hairdo? Reviews for Matthew MacFadyen seem to have been mixed so far, the inevitable 'Firth Factor' at least part of the reason. Personally I think he has a sexy, brooding presence to equal Firth's and (dare I say it) his Darcy has a little more charm and humanity when he does let his guard down. The scene where he bursts in upon Lizzie at the Collins' parsonage, all glove-twisting nervousness and incoherent attempts at small talk, captures perfectly the bewilderment of a man trained since childhood not to express his feelings, and made vulnerable for the first time by the conflicting emotions Lizzie has stirred in him.I do think his Darcy is oddly lacking in 'pride' though, his taciturnity attributed to having so many expectations to live up to that he never dares let down the facade of 'Mr. Darcy of Pemberley'. Nor do we get any sense, as in the book, that Lizzie's free-spirited influence alters his attitude or behaviour towards others, the explanation the audience is left with being that really he was a nice guy all along, just misunderstood.Keira Knightley's Lizzie brings nothing really new to the part, but whilst too stunningly beautiful to be the girl dismissed by Darcy as 'only tolerable', she has an abundance of the playfulness and charm which quickly captivates him. She is also a good enough actress to show Lizzie's own growing confusion and then loss as she realises how she has misread her own feelings. The chemistry between the two leads works well, their dance at Netherfield a key moment as their verbal sparring gives way to a growing physical awareness which neither of them is ready to admit. Other little incidents such as the touch of hands as Darcy helps Lizzie into her carriage keep the romance heating up, and it almost reaches boiling point in the first proposal scene. It does fizzle away disappointingly though in their final reconciliation, which promises much at the start with a heady mix of very slightly disarrayed nightwear, rolling thunder and smouldering gazes across a misty meadow, but, whilst tenderly played, it ends up being a little too coy for the 21st century. Come on Joe Wright, give us a kiss in the DVD version please!"
Pride & Prejudice,24-Oct-05,"Well Wright may have made a gritty depiction of life around 1800 - as he so repeatedly and anally goes on about because of when it was written as opposed to published - but it is HIS not Austen's and shouldn't claim to be an adaptation.Mrs Bennett looks like a rural washerwoman. This is a pampered woman - they have servants (remember the book scene with the servant dressing the hair, etc)? But Wright portrays her with rough reddened skin all down her chest, rough hands and working in the kitchen. And the pigs wandering through! If he wants bucolic, he should try Tess.Mr Bennett - the script makes too cuddly and modern and ignored the weakness in him. The scene where he stops Mary playing is supposed to make you cringe - not pass in seconds. If it doesn't - don't include it.MacFadyen is very weak in the part and seems to be doing some kind of Pride by numbers acting. The first proposal he looks like a nervous schoolboy rather than a man overcoming his pride to make a proposal beneath his station. Most of his lines, he could as well be reading a shopping list.Lydia is awful. Completely over the top with excessive shrieking and skipping. Indeed, Knightley plays Elizabeth more like the giggling inane character Lydia actually is in the book, at times.And Elizabeth. Half the time Knightley is, clearly, mimicking Ehle's voice and intonation - close your eyes to see what a copy it is. And in her role you see Wright's major error - there is NO PREJUDICE.From the first encounter with Darcy she clearly fancies him. When he comments to Bingley on the attractiveness of the women in the hall she initially looks hurt - not shocked and affronted. The latter should set up the prejudice side of things. And when she and 'caroline' are prancing round the room she comes across like a tease, obviously all over him. And by virtually cutting out Wickham you don't get Elizabeth invested enough there to set up the prejudicial aspects falling out of that relationship.And apparently it is Caroline not Miss Bingley. And Mr Bingley happily wanders into Jane's bedroom. And and and - Wright can boast about how great he is with period all he wants. But a few panorama shots of rural life (which show the preference for Hardy) don't excuse him the glaring blunders all over the place.The cinematographer - who clearly wants awards - should have been reined in. He veered between Bronte and Hardy throughout the film - and wasn't the last proposal shots/lighting from Tess? The need to see Darcy walk along through the 'scape with unkempt shirt was just dumb. But most importantly - when going between those 2 very different landscapes they forget the most important one - Austen. (She'd have laughed out loud at the Elizabeth = sad, therefore = rain, running through to picturesque folly, wet Darcy rubbish).I admit I found it impossible the watch the film without using the book as context. I was prepared to give it some leeway as it had to provide the story in a short space of time. But to forget fully one half of the core of the book in prejudice and Darcy to continually look more constipated than prideful, made it almost unwatchable. I could only see it as a mess with generally poor performances (when Knightley wasn't aping Ehle she was gurning or skipping or both and only calmed down a couple of times to indicate she does have some promise - but faffing about on swings to convey emotion isn't a substitute for a poor script and poor direction) - although for some it was simply a case of bad script.Tom Holland alone would escape censure. While he toned down the comic aspects of Collins, he did turn in a very interesting approach. Dench does superbly the schtick she can do in her sleep whether it be here or in Oscar Wilde - but this was supposed to be Lady Catherine De Bourgh NOT Lady Bracknell. She was just a little too sane.The shortened length could have been handled by a competent screenwriter, surely? Not characters filling in story gaps and helping along the audience all over the place. Elizabeth couldn't have come up with the £10k figure. And while they wanted to cut time with her learning of Darcy's involvement in Wickhams marriage the lines didn't fit with Lydia. It was the worst case of incongruous exposition in the piece.It really is appalling stuff. Anyone who reviews it saying it works well in the context of the book is someone I frankly don't believe has read or understood the characterisations in the thing. Wright seems to think his characters are in the 1990s not the 1709s from their behaviour. I'm not convinced he has read the book - he certainly doesn't understand it. He doesn't understand Austen's acerbic wit or lightness of touch - he certainly made a dull plodding film out of it.What is possibly worse was the sad pathetic need of the chick lit lovers to need the 'I love you, I love yous' all over the place so they can sigh and get off on it. The fact that it has no place in a work by Austen is apparently irrelevant.Anyone who reviews it as a film alone? Well, more difficult for me except I would note the poor acting, the weak Darcy, and the gurning skipping inane irritation of the whole thing. If you are going to adapt you can change a lot - but if it loses the spirit and key motivations, then don't insult the book by taking it's title."
Pride & Prejudice,12-Nov-05,"For years I have waited for a Pride and Prejudice that perfectly captured the wit, the intelligence, the passion and the romance of Jane Austen's classic. The 1995 mini is fabulous, and I have watched it many times, but I have always been frustrated that while it got so much of the dialogue and the detail right, it somehow fell flat on some of the more subtle dynamics of the novel.Finally this movie adaption has captured what has before been missing! True, it took license regarding some of the verbiage and detail of the novel, but it ultimately completely captured the characters, their transformations, their strengths, their vulnerabilities and their passions. You simply cannot do a definitive work on Pride and Prejudice in two hours. And this film doesn't try. But what it does attempt--to capture the story and characters, it does beautifully. It is well acted, well directed and connects as the book connected. While it has to rush and skimp on scenes and characters, it is the most authentic and true to the spirit of the novel version that I have ever seen. You simply do not want it to end...Well done!!!! It was about time!!!"
Pride & Prejudice,11-Nov-05,"This film is one of the worst adaptations of Pride and Prejudice ever filmed and if Jane Austen were alive, she would demand that her name be removed from the film. Austen's novel is only superficially a story of the development of true love between Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy. It is also a commentary on the class structure of Regency Britain. This film focuses only on the love story, thereby disappointing viewers who hoped it would do justice to the novel.There are numerous problems with the historical accuracy of the film. In the film, the dance at which Darcy snubs Elizabeth is not the refined dancing done by the gentry, to which the Bennet, Lucas, Bingley, and Darcy families belong, but is rather the dancing of the lower classes. The gentry would not have been dancing as if they were at a peasant barn dance. There are costume and hair problems, too. The custom of the period required married women to wear white cloth hats to cover their hair and for women to wear bonnets when outdoors. Women of the Regency period were not so liberated as to forego the bonnet requirements in public. The worst historical inaccuracy is the early morning meeting of Elizabeth (in her nightgown and coat) and Mr. Darcy (sans cravat and vest) at which they admit their love for each other. This is an unforgivable liberty with the novel. No respectable young woman or gentleman would venture out of doors in such a state of undress or seek to meet someone of the opposite sex at such an early hour. But the worst thing of all with this film is the mangling of Austen's dialogue and the atrocious modern dialogue. Austen's dialogue needs no assistance from a writer who thinks he/she can write like Austen. The writer of the non-Austen dialogue not only lacks Austen's talent but also has no feel for Austen's style. The juxtaposition of the two styles is jarring.As for the acting, the best is done by Judi Dench, who clearly understands the imperiousness of the aristocracy. Brenda Blethyn takes some liberties in making Mrs. Bennet less awful than Austen's portrayal. Her portrayal is interesting and seems to work. Donald Sutherland is miscast. His affected British accent is terrible and he portrays Mr. Bennet too much as a father of the 20th century and not a father of the late 18th century. Matthew MacFadeyn's portrayal of Darcy is flat. I can't imagine anyone falling in love with his Mr. Darcy. Keira Knightly is a pretty Elizabeth, but her portrayal of Elizabeth Bennet is far too modern. Knightly focuses on the Elizabeth's forthrightness, but her portrayal completely lacks an understanding of the social mores and conventions of the time. She would have done well to actually read the novel before attempting to portray Elizabeth and to do research on the behavior of women of the period.If one is making a period movie, one must be true to the period. This film needed an historical adviser who actually knows something about the Regency period. It also needed a writer who has a better appreciation and understanding of Austen's text. I can only hope Emma Thompson decides to do a film of Pride and Prejudice in the near future to erase this abomination from our minds.The best thing that can be said about this film is that it contains many pretty scenes of the English countryside. Chatsworth is well used as Pemberly (as it was in the 1995 BBC adaptation). But pretty scenery and pretty actors cannot save this film. True fans of Austen will rush home to watch their DVDs of the far superior 1995 BBC production with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth or to read Austen's text in order to wipe this version from their minds."
Pride & Prejudice,07-Oct-05,"If you have never heard of Jane Austen, seen the original movie or the 1995 BBC adaptation, or even seen a pop up version of the book, then this farcical attempt to show this classic love story may be considered vaguely endurable.From the opening scene, this film must be remembered for its awful acting, abominable miscasting and complete lack of the classic wit of Jane Austen.Whoever decided to cast actors (with the exception of the excellent Judi Dench) who have obviously never heard of Jane Austen, let alone read her, should be punished! Keira Knightley grimaces and grins through every scene, and came across as being so obnoxious that no-one would want to marry her! Darcy looked as if he was trying to remember his lines throughout the whole film and the rest of the Bennet girls were interchangeable in their lack of portraying their characters as they were originally written.This version failed to show the proper Pride and Prejudice that both Darcy and Elizabeth suffered from and, at the end of the longest two hours of my life, who cared whether they got together or not! Absolutely abysmal - even the too few minutes of Judi Dench cannot save this rubbish. I cannot think of anything good to say about this film apart from that it eventually ended!"
Pride & Prejudice,18-Sep-05,"I went to see suspecting I would hate it, I did. Everything about it was wrong; it was like they were filming a different book. Granted the locations and houses very lovely (if not a little miscast-yes even the house were wrong for their parts) Keira was too modern, dull and frankly I found it unpleasant to watch her. Were everyone else sees Darcy as a sex god the writer of this saw him as sexually frustrated and inadequate. Bingley was stupid and dippy (he isn't meant to be) and the Bennett's were shown to be destitute and for some unknown reason farmers, this is incorrect and ludicrous. The very idea that Mr Bennett would answer the door in his night gear with the rest of the family dressed in their underwear to in the middle of the night is stupid. They had servants. Mr Collins was not repulsive and greasy merely stupid and obnoxious, Georgina Darcy was ugly and old and Miss Bingley wore a sleeveless dress, what! As if! It is Historically inaccurate and even the ending is unsatisfying. I could go on for days. I hated it so much as not only was it nothing like the book but I fear that for many people it will be their fist experience of this great novel and it will give them the worst possible idea of it. The BBC version is so superior it's not even funny and everything about this version is an insult to its memory. In short if you must see it be sure you have read the book first or seen the BBC version other wise you will be lead done the deluded road that this is what it's like, which its not!"
Pride & Prejudice,18-Sep-05,"This quintessentially English film is utterly charming - a very traditional interpretation of Jane Austen's 1813 novel that manages to entertain, amuse and even move. First time director Joe Wright has worked with television playwright Deborah Moggach's script and a wonderful collection of mainly British actors to delight us. The versatile camera-work, luscious countryside, grand settings, period costumes, and atmospheric music are evidence of a work on which much love has been lavished.At the heart of this triumph is the delightful 20 year old Keira Knightley as the assured and sharp Elizabeth Bennett, the second of five daughters looking to be married off by an anxious mother. Knightley's rise in the thespian firmament has been meteoric and this is her best performance to date in a role for which she is perfectly cast. Matthew MacFadyen is suitably brooding and gauche as Mr Darcy, but the cast list is enlivened with splendid British character actors, including Brenda Blethyn as Lizzie's irascible mother, Tom Hollander as a diminutive cleric seeking a wife, and Judi Dench as the formidable Lady Catherine, plus the Canadian Donald Sutherland (Lizzie's wise father).This is a Georgian world in which social conventions present a veritable minefield for indiscretions or misunderstandings and in which a formal dance can be as intricate an occasion as international diplomacy. Pride and prejudice are only two of the obstacles to be overcome before inevitably true love brings Lizzie and her dark knight nose to nose (we don't even see a kiss). Passionate stuff indeed."
Pride & Prejudice,30-Oct-05,"Maybe if you've never read any English literature or only ever watched the Hollywood version of any book you might find merit in this awful film. It has the directorial and scripting skill of Shoreditch. The BBC 1995 adaptation is both very enjoyable and close to the book and captures the atmosphere between Elisabeth and Darcy very well.The characters in this production are badly miscast, Sutherland as Bennet seems a total buffoon. Bingley likewise acts the fool and it is imcomrepnsible that he my be a friend of Darcy. I can't imagine how Judi Dench could have accepted the role, maybe she thought it was a surreal comedy version.Quotes from the book are thrown in out of context. Huge chunks are missing, the important episode with Wickham is glossed over.Mr Collins is however very good, and towers above the other members of the cast.The only good thing is we didn't pay to see it. Wait for the DVD and use to keep a table from wobbling."
Pride & Prejudice,21-Oct-05,"Actually, I was highly disappointed in the movie. I admit having a strong bias towards Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth, and I actually said earlier that a new adaptation wasn't necessary as there is a perfectly functional BBC miniseries, but still I was disappointed. Don't get me wrong. I thought Keira Knightley made a very good Elizabeth. She has just the headstrong and witty nature a real Lizzy needs. But that was about the only redeeming quality of the movie I could find. Though, now I think of it, it is good that this one doesn't last six hours.I am no expert on Regency life and times, but still I saw quite some anachronisms or historical inadequacies. For example, when Jane is ill at Netherfield, Bingley enters her sick chamber. Preposterous! Then, later, Lady Catherine visits when all the family was already asleep. One would never do that except in cases of severe emergency. Both Lizzy and Darcy walk around not fully clothed when they meet for the second proposal. The girls are out in society, yet wear their hair loose. Everything happened suddenly. Suddenly, Charlotte is married. Suddenly, Lydia is married. Suddenly, Lizzy goes to Derbyshire, and suddenly she's at Pemberley. They also cut out a lot of minor characters (the Hursts, the aunt and uncle in Meryton) and a lot of background story, which is of course inevitable when you want to tell the same story in less than half the time. I missed those characters, it made the evening scene at Netherfield seem lacking. Most other characters were underdeveloped as well. Col. Fitzwilliam only remained to tell Lizzy about Darcy's interference in Jane's relationship with Bingley, otherwise he'd been cut out too. I thought Bingley a schoolboy, like an older Ron Weasley. Clumsy and insecure, and not quite a gentleman. The Bennet sisters were vulgar, as was the mother, and the father had not that wit he had in the book (and P&P2). Georgiana was too confident, certainly next to her brother, who is supposed to be ten years her senior. Darcy was ""tolerable, I suppose, but not handsome enough to tempt me"". There was no real character development, again due to lack of time, and hardly a reason to dislike him except for his remark at the Meryton gathering-of-peasants. I liked the scenery, with the very old trees and the beautiful spot on the rocks, as well as the folly at Rosings and the moorland near Meryton. The Bennett family was living at a farm, not a manor. I admit this brings out the contrast with Pemberley and Rosings, but I think they outdid that. I thought Rosings and Pemberley maybe a little too large and elaborate next to the farm, certainly as neither of them is the seat of nobility.I think I got my point across; I haven't really finished yet, but I'll stop now. All in all I think it would have been an enjoyable movie with some deja vu's if it hadn't been called Pride and Prejudice. Clueless, maybe?"
Pride & Prejudice,28-Jul-05,"In 1995 the 5 hours miniseries of Pride & Prejudice, with Colin Firth as Darcy and Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth Bennet, was a big hit in England and the Netherlands. It even inspired Helen Fielding to write the Bridget Jones's novels. Therefor, whether you'll like the new 2005 movie mainly depends on the fact if you've seen the version that was done ten years ago. If you have, you'll probably be very disappointed with the Knightly movie. If you haven't, well, maybe this romantic flick may be 'amiable' enough for you.For those who aren't familiar with the story: Pride & Prejudice is a romantic costume drama that takes place in 19th century England and is based on the famous novel by Jane Austen. The story is about the Bennet family, a father, mother and five or six daughters. The only way to secure the future of the children is to marry a party that owns a lot of money. Jane, the oldest sister, is beautiful but a little icy. She hopes to marry young Bingley, a rich aristocrat who just moved to a castle nearby. Her younger sister Elizabeth, the main character of the movie, wants to help her conquer his heart, but finds out that Bingley's best friend, the rich but arrogant mister Darcy, sabotages her plans. Elizabeth and Darcy start out as enemies, but as the story progresses they both find out that their opinions of each other are based on wrong information, pride and prejudice.Let's bring the good news first. The new Pride & Prejudice is the big Keira Knightly show. Although she cannot top Jennifer Ehle's performance, Knightly proves that she has real star-power and that she is able to carry a movie. She looks lovely in this flick: she enchants you with her great smile and has the charms of a young Winona Ryder. Dame Judi Dench is excellent as Darcy's powerful aunt who is against a marriage and Donald Sutherland has a both moving and funny scene at the end of the movie when he gives permission to Darcy to marry Elizabeth. The end of the movie is actually better than the one in the miniseries. Okay, then the bad news. I guess the main flaw of this new version is Darcy himself, a role played by Matthew MacFadyen. In the story he is rather dull and generally uninterested in what's going on. It must be difficult to replace Colin Firth as leading man and the Darcy of the miniseries of course had more (screen)time to show his inner struggle. But the new Darcy is so dull that frankly you don't care if he ends up winning Elizabeth's heart or not. There is absolutely no spark between Knightly and MacFadyen. At the end of the movie they don't even kiss and as an audience you couldn't care less. But Darcy isn't the only one that seems miscast. The new mister Bingley is  despite his Jamie Oliver haircut  a real nerd, and mister Wickham, who falls in love with Elizabeth but elopes with her younger sister, lacks the depth to be an interesting villain. Because of the time-frame, the movie is less subtle than the miniseries. There's a lot to be told in two hours and because of that there is hardly any suspense. Problems rise but they are solved within minutes. But what I really missed were the great dialogs. In the miniseries heavy emotions were always masqueraded by politeness. Darcy doesn't say ""Wow, it's great to see you, Elizabeth"" but instead asks if her parents are in good health. The things that are NOT said were more interesting than the things that were indeed spoken out. The encounters between Elizabeth and Darcy always turned out to be great fights in which words and sentences were used as swords and daggers. I really missed that in the new version. Come to think of it, I also missed the humor you did see in Ang Lee's Sense & Sensibility, also based on a Jane Austen novel. Where is Hugh Grant when you need him?A friend of mine  also a journalist  really liked this movie. But he hadn't seen the Colin Firth/Jennifer Ehle version from 1995. So perhaps I'm a little hard on what was presented to me last week, because the film does have its qualities.7 of out of 10"
Pride & Prejudice,14-Oct-05,"Sorry to say but was disappointed in the film. It was very very rushed, as I suppose you can understand a movie length version of Pride & Prejudice would be and I felt that a lot of the major scenes were glossed over just to get through the story. As the movie is so rushed, unfortunately you don't get to really know about and feel for each of the characters much at all. Not only that, this movie is Boring. I say that with a capital B. 1/3 of the way through I started yawning and couldn't wait for the movie to be over. As I have read the book and watch the BBC version, I knew how many scenes had to go, before I could finally leave the cinema. Mr Darcy whoever he is in this movie, definitely can't act. He looks also too young to play Mr Darcy. Every word that comes out of his mouth is rushed like he needs to get through the script or something. Where is the build up? At first, he seems confused with everything. He is just bizarre! It all looks put on. Was trying not to compare to the Colin Firth version but if you love that version, you will most likely be disappointed anyway.The costumes are absolutely shocking. Where are the corsets? I know Elizabeth is poor, but I think she still knows how to dress as some sort of ladylike fashion, and hasn't been brought up in a squaller. Her dresses indicates she might be the poorest peasant in all of England.I didn't agree with a couple of scenes in the movie in the fact, that I don't think it would be considered proper in that society for men to do such things, honestly Mr Bingley who has wealth should know better. There is some things that are said that sound too modern for the period this movie is set in, and not at all like Jane Austen. Bingley's character is shockingly donee, to me he behaves like a simpleton, not a character to like and respect. What about that laugh of his!!! I Wickham hardly has a presence and Mr & Mrs Hurst and a couple of other characters have no presence at all. Keira did okay, but it just ain't the same."
Pride & Prejudice,13-Feb-06,"I really hated this - it is OK to modify scenes from the book, but to change the spirit of it completely is too much. And to change Jane Austen's witty dialogue for some of the dross, especially early on in the piece was definitely not an improvement.This loud, grubby group were not my idea of the Bennetts or their friends. The Bennetts may have been poor and may well have lived in a shabby house, but they had more class than this lot.As for the proposition that Darcy's aloofness was because he shy and not confident, he just seemed pathetic to me and Darcy should certainly not be pathetic. Except for the scene where he gave a lovely smile - Mathew MacFadyen wore the same expression pretty much throughout, (which was not surprising as this Darcy was such a boring character), and Kiera Knightly just seemed much to flighty for Lizzy, she seemed more like Lydia.To me - it is the Benny Hill version of P&P - no subtlety, little wit, almost just slapstick.Thank God for the BBC."
Pride & Prejudice,04-Sep-05,"Pride and Prejudice was an absolutely fantastic film. A great cast, and Keira Knightly did an excellent job and Matthew Macfadyen was a wonderful in the role of Mr Darcy. The cinematography was so ridiculously good, there were some fantastic shots and the costumes were also fantastic. The script was fairly good, it is true to the classic by Jane Austen, Mr Wickam could have made more of an appearance, and had a striking resemblance to one Orlando Bloom. The movie moved fairly fast but trying to fit such a novel into two hours had to be hard anyway, so I say well done to all involved, as such a beloved book can be a hard project to take on, but after watching it I really can't wait until to see it again!!!"
Pride & Prejudice,13-Sep-05,"Having attended a regional charity premiere last night I can safely say that the actors chosen have more than succeeded in bringing their characters to life. This adaptation hit the perfect note every time in terms of humour, romance and warmth. Keira Knightley plays a wonderfully spirited Lizzie and MacFayden really hits the spot as a dour yet shy Darcy. The whole cast throw themselves into their roles with gusto and overall the film left this viewer charmed and delighted. Its obviously going to have a tough time proving itself to those who loved the BBC adaptation as that seems to have become for so many THE adaptation of the novel, but give this one a chance, those that don't will be missing out. Sorry to keep this brief but I don't want to be accused of giving anything away!"
Pride & Prejudice,22-Nov-05,"For the sake of starting with something positive, let's throw out the very biggest problems like historical placement and accuracy. If we can get stupid enough to ignore a boat load of adaptation problems, we might at least admit that this movie was beautifully designed and very well shot. Watch this monstrosity with the sound off, and you'll enjoy some remarkable cinematography.But no lavish castles or livid sunrises can rescue such a mess.First, we'd have to cut off the head of the beast in terms of raw materials and leadership. The screenplay borders on jabberwocky, honoring only the most banal of Austen's dialog. And despite being the consummate romance, director Joe Wright isn't able to coax anything more than a lukewarm shrug from any of the key players.Speaking of key players, let's look at casting.Keira Knightley (Pirates of the Caribbean, King Arthur) reduces the smart and self-possessed Elizabeth to little more than teen petulance. She strides triumphant through the movie, always armed with some well worn leather-bound tome (we can safely assume it's not Stanislavski), looking for ways to disarm people with her aplomb. Unfortunately, Knightley has a limited number of tools with which to construct the facade. One is a frightening and toothsome grin-laugh thing that turns her into a Rankin/Bass villain (a'la Burgermeister, the Bumble, HeatMiser, etc). The rest of the time, Knightley relies on her jutting jaw and droopy lip to illicit a blatant sexuality (which happens to be completely wrong for this character). However, instead of the intended pouty sex kitten allure, she looks as if a large dose of Thorazine is just kicking in. We half expect a ribbon of drool to escape down her chin at any moment.Then there is our darling Darcy. No one will ever touch the haughty torment of Colin Firth. Even if we hadn't seen Firth's Darcy, Macfadyen would seem a bit flat. We get precious little of his prickly pride (which is fairly significant to the story, being in the title and all). His too-soft underbelly is exposed the minute he sets eyes on Elizabeth, which irrevocably breaks the seal on his crusty credibility. The most powerful aspect of this romance (in the book & BBC version) is how it so utterly surprises Elizabeth - and us - when he makes that first proposal. Watching Macfadyen spill the beans in his first 10 seconds on screen leaves very little reason to keep watching. He could have benefited from just a bit of Caroline Bingley's over-the-top nastiness.As for the rest of the cast, they come in two flavors: shallow and boring, or giggly and squirming like cheerleaders in the back of the bus. One has to wonder if it took more than Thorazine to get the rest of the cast through this project, particularly after seeing Donald Sutherland's version of Mr. Bennett. Dreamy and completely disconnected, laudanum appears to be his buffer of choice. Of course we expect Lydia and Kitty to be a bit silly, which they are, but they both seem to be in the throes of a bad Ecstasy binge. Their squealing and twittering is relentless and positively manic. And poor Mr. Collins (actor Tom Hollander, who also plays the deliciously neurotic and ruined Anthony Meredith in Gosford Park) appears to be stoned out of his head and on the brink of full-on paranoia, although trying very ...hard ...not to be. He was definitely capable of giving David Bamber (the A&E Collins) a run for his money in this role. Unfortunately, ""big eyes and stick-up-the-arse marionette movement"" must have been Wright's direction for the unfortunate Hollander.Countless smaller irritations abound: The evil Mr. Wickham has roughly 9 words of dialog with which to make us first adore and then despise him (a fancy trick for any actor, let alone someone with no noticeable screen time). Dame Judy Dench is sadly overcast as the fiery old crone, Lady Catherine de Bourg, which is exactly the same as every other role she's been saddled with for the last 10 years. What a tragic waste. And she brought almost too much credibility to the trivial Lady Catherine. Even Charles Bingley's sunny disposition seems to be drawn in crayon. Far from the agreeable innocent we all adore, he comes off as weak and mildly retarded and seemingly incapable of combing his particularly unruly shock of ginger hair. The result is some kind of love child of Liberace and Howdy Doody. Darcy would have never befriended someone like this, and not just because of the hair. Brenda Blethyn (Little Voice, Saving Grace) turns in the only enjoyable performance as the terminally squirrelly Mrs. Bennett. At least she's fun to watch, albeit in the manner of a fuzzy rodent with a firecracker tied to her tail. But she occasionally lacked conviction in terms of her chronic ""nervous condition."" When will Hollywood learn that unless you bleed every 28 days or are named Ang Lee, you're not qualified to handle Jane Austen? Go tackle the Brontes. And there must be at least a half dozen more gladiator movies waiting to be made or remade. Heck, take Dickens on another spin around the dance floor! But leave the next Austen adaptation to the BBC, A&E, or Masterpiece Theatre where they might still care more about characters and story than honoring a 5-picture deal for the latest tarted-up teen stars."
Pride & Prejudice,22-Sep-05,"This is a deeply dumbed-down version of Austen.Every hairstyle is wrong, the Bennett family look and behave like Californian hippies prone to spouting (very) occasional bits of Austen dialogue.I will give you one key indicator of how badly researched and produced this film is: at one point Lady Catherine de Burgh, one of the great snobs in English literature, is handed a cup of tea by a servant and says ""thank you""!The fact that the Bennetts live in the same house that the Herberts inhabited in The Draughtsman's Contract is a surreal touch for any Greenaway fan..."
Pride & Prejudice,24-Nov-05,"No one go see Pride & Prejudice. It is the most wretched, boring, miserable movie I have seen all year. Keira Knightley does not look or act the part (note how she chooses to act with her chin every time she gets emphatic) and I've sold lumber more charismatic and interesting than the man who plays Mr. Darcy. There are so many clichéd shots (if I ever have to see someone stare at a candle in the foreground for an entire shot while having a conversation, and then blow it out for the scene change, or a door slamming shut with a dull, resounding crash directly into the camera, I may scream.)Darcy is boring; Collins is boring; Bingley looks like a woman; Mrs. Bennett is not funny as she is in the BBC version, she is merely irritating. And oh the giggling. The horrid, horrid giggling. I think a good 15 minutes of this movie is comprised of giggling. Another 15 goes to ""moving"" shots of the beautiful landscape, while Lizzie stares pensively into the distance.I offer this as an especial warning to anyone who has not read the novel, who would be doing themselves a horrible disservice by seeing the movie before reading the book and watching the delightful Colin Firth BBC version - which is in every imaginable way a superior film to this sack of sugary rubbish. Thank you. It felt good to get that out of my system. Please take my advice. For your sakes."
Pride & Prejudice,25-Sep-05,"This film is bad. There are no words that do justice to what this film has done to the most beloved work of one of the greatest English authors. To start with, the film cannot seem to decide when it is set. We see scenes and costumes from a plethora of different historical periods (especially in the ballroom scenes). This is nothing to the dialogue, however, which cannot decide if it wants to be modern or self-consciously antiquated. Apparently just using Austen's dialogue would be too easy. The characters' manners wouldn't fit into any period (see Georgianna Darcy in particular). The scene of Darcy's second proposal appears to have been stolen from a Mills and Boon novel. I can only imagine that the makers of this film have never read the book or were just having a laugh. Even the acting doesn't redeem it, as even great performers collapse under an absurd script. The two leads are particularly bad as they attempt to smoulder. Please do not go to see this film, as giving them money would only serve to encourage this sort of thing."
Pride & Prejudice,20-Feb-06,"Judged as a movie in its own right, Joe Wright's Pride and Prejudice is a disappointment. Judged as an adaptation of a classic Jane Austen novel, however, it is nothing short of a travesty. For those of you already acquainted with the book, be warned; the only thing that Wright's work has in common with the Austen masterpiece is it's title. Even with the most superficial of viewings, it is clear that the script holds little more than a passing resemblance to the novel. Wright goes to great pains to include most of the story's key features, but has seemingly neither the time nor the inclination to go into any real manner of depth with them. Important plot points - such as Lydia's disappearance and subsequent elopement - are introduced and resolved so quickly that the viewer is denied the luxury of suspense. Consequently, the film feels remarkably lacking in drama, and a sense of flat detachment permeates into every aspect of the script.Unfortunately, this rushed pacing leaves Elizabeth's journey - both physical and emotional - reduced to mere bullet-notes, and neither she nor those around her demonstrate any growth as individuals. Characterisation is sacrificed again and again as Mr Wright's attempts to cram as much action into the allotted two-hours go increasingly awry. Much-loved characters are reduced to mere nonentities, or else distorted so greatly as to be irreconcilable with their originals. Indeed, in watching this movie, I was left doubting whether the script's writers had read their source material at all. Mr. Bingley's role was cheapened to that of the comic relief (presumably to accentuate the merits of his friend, Mr Darcy), and Georgiana Darcy - far from the sensitive young girl of the novel - is portrayed as a inanely-giggling twit. For those new to Austen's world, there are shamefully few reasons for them notice or care about these characters. Adaptation or not, there can be no excuse for such sloppy characterisation.Historical accuracy too is snubbed, despite Mr Wright's pretensions towards 'gritty' realism. From the fashions to the dancing, it is clear to anyone with even a basic knowledge of the period that factual errors exist at every turn. However, these outward faults could perhaps be forgiven had the film at least attempted to remained true to the spirit of the era. Sadly, this is not the case. In attempting to modernise Austen's characters - doubtlessly due to the studio's assumption that audiences would not understand the originals - they lose all sense of credibility, and the script descends into farce as even the most basic social conventions of the day are blithely ignored. Gentlemen enter ladies bedrooms, introductions are bypassed, and Mr Darcy has apparently no qualms about walking around (and visiting his potential father-in-law) in a state of undress. Though seemingly small, such mistakes would be unthinkable in the Regency period, where a person's standing in society depended as much on their decorum as it did on their fortune. Manners and restraint act as the keystone of Austen work; they are both the driving force and the central conflict of her romances, and to remove them so completely from the script makes the whole film ring hollow.Nevertheless, despite all this, the greatest flaw in Mr Wright's adaptation must surely be the dialogue. Far from Miss Austen's delightfully light repartee, we are instead treated to a wearily cumbersome script that fails to inspire either humour or interest, and which makes only a half-hearted attempt to remain true to it's source material. In the novel, it is dialogue that acts as the catalyst for the Darcy/Elizabeth romance - their agile debates demonstrate both wit and intelligence, and remain some of the most memorable exchanges ever committed to the English language. In the movie, however, it is difficult to discern any spark between them whatsoever. Keira Knightly's waspish Elizabeth snipes, pouts, and trills her way through their conversations, while Matthew MacFadeyn's Darcy looks bored and faintly embarrassed (though given the cringe-inducing drivel that he is forced to utter during the second proposal, I cannot say that I blame him). Frankly, there was no need for the script-writers to attempt to re-write Austen's famously sparkling dialogue. The 1995 BBC adaptation lifted most of it's lines directly from the novel itself, and was consequently hailed as the finest costume dramas of it's generation. I can hardly imagine anyone willing to subject themselves to a second viewing of Wright's dire revision.All in all, this movie falls woefully short of expectations. Special blame must surely be laid at Keira Knightly, however, whose portrayal of Elizabeth Bennett sees one of literatures most beloved heroines reduced to a simpering shrew."
It Chapter Two,09-Sep-19,"It's been a while since I've read the book or seen the first movie; so I apologize if I get some things wrong.TLDR; The film drags on in the middle by splitting up the crew and subjecting them to meaningless jump scares. This means little character interaction (which is part of what the first movie had going for it). By the time you get to the final confrontation with Pennywise, you're just tired of the jump scares and want it to be over because you're not really rooting for the losers. And if you are, it's mostly because of what was established in the first film.Pros:
The film starts off great. Somehow the scene at the bridge manages to match the iconic opening scene of the first.Skarsgård is an amazing Pennywise and is creepy as hell.Stan's speech in Richie's second flashback is great and actually funny.Casting is, for the most part, really good. I think it was hard for some of the adult actors to find a balance between being recognizable while still showing how they've matured over time. Adult Richie is too kid-like while Bev is too mature to the point of being unrecognizable.Cons:
Bowers is half-assed. Literally just used for three jump scares and nothing else. Either imply that he died and leave him out or fully use him like he is in the book as the epitome of the corruption in Derry.The final form of Pennywise is unsatisfying. It's literally a clown torso on some sort of arachnid body. They needed to go full arachnid alien like it is in the book. I think this part is just difficult to translate from the book though.Stan's letter at the end cheapens his death. Instead of him literally being unable to handle his fear of IT, his suicide is portrayed as a sacrifice to save the others.There's next to no character development and very little meaningful interaction between characters. I blame this mostly on the middle 90 minutes where they all split up. It's totally different from the first film where they are actually a team.Speaking of which, this part where they all go their separate ways to find their ""tokens"" is so contrived. The story literally loses all its steam due to this and makes it feel way too long.All of the monster scenes except the ones with Pennywise have terrible CGI. They might be gross and/or startling but you can see them coming and they don't contribute much.About 1/3 to 1/2 of the jokes just kinda fell flat.The constant jump scenes and long running time just make this movie exhausting to watch. It was just a constant cycle of ""pan to character, give a little backstory, jump scare, repeat""."
It Chapter Two,07-Sep-19,"I really, realllly wanted to like this film. As a huge fan of the original mini-series (and EVERYTHING Tim Curry), I knew I'd have a challenge going into both Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 with an open mind. I had to separate. I didn't have as high of expectations as I did for Chapter 1 as Part 2 of the mini series was much weaker than the Part 1 anyway as well as Stephen King's It (Book).The actors were great. Even the first few jump scares were decent, and then it just became overkill. And not scary whatsoever. All of the CGI monsters look ridiculous and completely take you out of the moment. I grew up watching 80s/90s horror (AND LOVING IT). The baddies were REAL and TERRIFYING. For example, Mrs. Massey, the bloated bathtub corpse in The Shining. That was a real, completely horrifying image that has stayed with me 30 years after I First saw the movie. I don't understand the obsession with CGI when there's no need for it.Sadly, this movie was just a drawn out bore."
It Chapter Two,14-Oct-19,Why they tried to add so much humor is beyond me. It ruined the entire movie.Now the guy that plays Pennywise did a great job. Except for the CGI Pennywise (that was out of his hands).When he played the character with no CGI I was blown away.
It Chapter Two,08-Sep-19,I'm a big baby when it comes to scary movies and even I can say I wasn't scared. The jump scares were alright but the CGI monsters just made the movie feel immature. Also....Pennywise is a flesh eating clown with hypnotic powers.....and they bullied him to death to defeat him. It was just such a corny scene watching pennywise shrink as they say mean things to him lmao
It Chapter Two,27-Sep-19,"Only ""God"" knows how I wanted to love this film.As a big fan of the (masterpiece) book, I was eager for part II. I liked the first part. I didnt LOVE IT, but it was a good adaption.In the other hand, the second part is... Slow. I didnt feel the ""chemistry"" between the adult version of the Losers Club. Dont get me wrong, the acting is good, but... Something's off.I didnt get the insinuations about Ritchie's sexual orientation (why? And it wasnt in the book either), and the way they chose to kill Pennywise. That was SHAMEFUL. Ultra-simple solution and it made me feel dumb... SIGH.Oh! Last but not least: THE CGI FEST. I really dont like CGI in horror flicks. I dont think it is IMPOSSIBLE to use it, not at all, but God... What a CGI MONSTER FEST... I think Muschietti has a great future and a director, but there's a lot to learn...IT Part II is a let down. Sadly."
It Chapter Two,30-Sep-19,"Agh.. WOAH! agh.. WOAH! agh.. WOAH! agh.. WOAH!
The beginning 30-40 mins was a decent setup, well shot and the dinner scene was somewhat funny. Then it all goes down hill from there."
It Chapter Two,05-Oct-19,"Firstly, those people giving this a 9 and 10....what did they put in your popcorn?! Did you see a different movie?! Should you be allowed to leave reviews if your taste in movies is that bad?! Some poor sod might read your review and go see this movie...do you not feel any guilt!This was AWFUL! Its not even worth constructing proper sentences for so I'll leave these points here:1. The terrible acting. It was awful. The actors were either bored or overacting (Bill, Mike, Richie). Seriously terrible.2. What on earth was the need to make this a 3 hour movie?! It was so unnecessarily dragged out and incredibly boring3. The story had no story. Mike tells them there's an Indian ritual they must collect artefacts for which separates them all for 2 hours of the movie but then it turns out there was no ritual...WHAT?! What was the point of that?! Ben threw into the fire something he'd held dear in his wallet for 27 years for...no.....reason??4. Seperating the characters like that and filling the scenes with flashbacks made sure there was no character development5. Erm what happened to Bills wife? Bev is kissing all the guys but is still married. They turned Bev's character into a gold digging floozy by having her kiss Bill then choose the wealthy and better looking Ben for his boat?!6. What in the name of all that is Mike Myers was that terrible CGI about?! The old granny scene in the original was scary as she was a creepy old lady not a 15 foot naked zombie like monster7. Speaking of zombies...Bowers zombie friend drives cars and breaks him out of an asylum? If zombies can do that, why did Pennywise need Bowers?8. Speaking of Bowers...what was the point of him in all his over acting melodrama? He did nothing. Except to prove you can be stabbed in the heart and walk away absolutely fine9. Stanley's suicide notes to each and every one of them that he wrote and posted before killing himself?! The act was supposed to have been done out of pure fear...not as a human sacrifice10. The grand finale. After spending 2 hours looking for tokens and Mike carrying around a badly built dustbin made in a beginner's pottery class, turns out all you had to do was hurt Pennywises feelings by calling him a clown and he will turn into a baby? I have no words....reallyPeople do yourselves a favour, avoid this at all costs"
It Chapter Two,26-Sep-19,"...it is a disgrace because it is a gross betrayal of the original book. IT - the book - is a psychological thriller about friendship, about relationships, it is about the deep fears we have as kids and which grow with us until we are adults; it is about how we learn fighting and ultimately defeating these fears.
IT - the movie, this movie - is a cheap zombie movie stuffed with special effects and CGI with the sole purpose of jump-scaring the audience. There is no narrative, no storytelling, nothing more than a random - and awfully long - sequence of third league horror vignettes.
Shame on this movie!"
It Chapter Two,13-Sep-19,"Okay so saw the first remake of the movie, was absolutely in love. I went and saw the second one today and didn't feel any where near close to what I felt for the first one. It was super long but that isn't even what upset me. It was just lacking in delivery! Pennywise was hardly in the movie. He was in it but they spent so much time soul searching the past of the characters that the real present stuff went lacking. Needless to say the first remake is an all time favorite. This one, I definitely should've waited until it came out on DVD. Just being honest. The first one was way to good for this to be part 2. It didn't deliver the expectation that the first one set."
It Chapter Two,04-Sep-19,"""For 27 years, I dreamt of you. I craved you. I've missed you!""Pros:The casting director very much shines in the spotlight here. If there is a category for Best Casting Director in the Academy Award, I am all in to bet that It: Chapter Two's will not just get nominated, but win very big. The casting director deserves a standing ovation for choosing the right actors for the right characters that resemble a lot with the younger-selves from the predecessor.You will feel the emotional impact of The Losers' Club as a whole. The fear that feeds their souls, the memories that hunt them & the hopeless feeling that manipulates their strength all leave a strong impression to wonder within & about.The various & disparate forms of IT should give a blast of excitement to the audience. This is the most entertaining part of the movie where you get to watch new other-worldly creatures lingering within the shadows or the old monsters are back to haunt them with a peek-a-boo! It is gross, weird and definitely strange.The heartwarming story of The Losers' Club friendship is the beautiful gem you will find in no other horror movies this year. The connection they have is so strong and palpable,An excellent set of transition techniques that jump from one place to another, giving that ominous vibe and at the same time feels like an adventure.Cons:Albeit the creatures are entertaining to watch, however it lacks the manifestation of the scary rituals that should follow. This is the main problem with the IT movies, it is not terrifying nor scary enough to make you have a nightmare. Even sometimes it is laughable due to its unprecedented nature of the creatures' features.The real form of IT is upsetting and disappointing. I can strongly say that the majority will love IT's true form from the 1990 Television Mini-Series in comparison to the remake because that looks scarier, deadlier & more realistic.It is super slow and draggy that it doesn't need to be at almost 3 hours mark. 2 hours should be the best run time for this movie like IT Chapter One. It has nothing much to talk about especially during the first hour. Reunion, get together, a few jumpscare parts. That's all there is to it.The second act of the movie (halfway) feels as if you are watching 5 to 6 different short films instead. Because it has that slow-burning nature, the scenes feel disjointed from one another. It spends around 45 minutes to an hour to look at every members of The Losers' Club being haunted by Pennywise.Verdict: IT CHAPTER TWO is certainly fresh and enjoyable. Hopes up not, its extremely slow-going story may make the audience bore enough to put you into sleep mode. IT CHAPTER TWO walks you into a journey of the insidious Derry town albeit its lack of formidable creatures."
It Chapter Two,06-Sep-19,"Well, this was a waste..
This movie is just a long run of jumpscares (all the f'ing time), not at all scary CGI monsters and reusing of the same jokes and ""scares"". I don't think the director has used a single practical effect in this picture.There is no tension or character-investing in this movie, and the director manages to make the cast (who works with What they have been giving) look terrible in their acting. It is not scary, just very, very annoying and does not live up to either the book, the mini-tv series or part 1 of the reboot from 2017 (even though it also was an CGI orgy).If you like a horror movie, where you don't need a build of tension or the director sticking to a plot or giving the audience a decent payout, but just adds a lot of jumpscares for almost 3 hours - You will love this..
But hey, it's just my opinion.."
It Chapter Two,06-Oct-19,"I personally didn't enjoy IT 2017 so I didn't have much hope for part 2 but I was expecting them to at least tone down the CGI instead they went overkill with it no imagination used here just in your face flashy CGI effects that look fake and plastic the only thing frightening about this movie is that sadly because it made money at the box office more Stephen King books are going to get remakes and it won't be long before we get an all CGI Maximum Overdrive movie remake.There are more scenes with Pennywise transforming and creating twisted ways to mess with the returning losers club members but sadly they are all done with CGI and are all standard copy and paste scenes from the original mini series and when the movie finally gets to it's climax the makers of this ""Horror Movie"" think by simply making Pennywise bigger it instills more fear into the audience when really all it does is scream CGI and all the suspence is watered down to bigger pixels on screen than there where before ""Terrifying""The only and I do mean only saving grace this movie has is the cast they all do a great job on screen especially considering they have to pretend to be scared and flee in terror from a green screen it's not the actors fault this movie was a big let down.I recommend watching the original IT mini series if you haven't already seen it Tim Curry's performance as Pennywise is the reason why people who grew up in the 90s have a fear of clowns because a great actor in the right role can make all the difference in a movie Tim Curry will always be Pennywise no matter how many remakes are made just like Judy Garland will always be Dorothy in The Wizard of OZ there performance makes the movie so memorable and it can't be re-created no matter how much CGI you use."
It Chapter Two,06-Sep-19,"After seeing Chapter One I expected so much more, unfortunately IT didn't deliver. The film starts out with an overly graphic bashing scene that tries hard to be topical but instead seems to be there just to dare you to criticize it's honesty. And things just go downhill from there. The Loser's Club of the first film reunites 27 years later to have another go at defeating Pennywise, but where the kids were charming and you wanted to root for them, the adults all go separate ways to have their own jump scene moments through an overly long two hour middle section of the film. The film bogs because it keeps showing flashbacks to when they were kids instead of building the characters as adults. The effect is that you never really care about them as adults, they're just an excuse to show CGI monsters that never really scare you on any level. The pacing of the film is so roughshod that it never lets any suspense build as it jumps from one scene to the next, while you keep checking your watch wondering how much more of this you'll have to endure. The middle becomes a bit of a horror film mish mash with an homage to John Carpenter's The Thing (verbatim quote and all) a little bit of Toy Story erector spider, a dash of Poltergeist's Native American mumbo jumbo added in with a couple of million years old space entity tossed in in case you needed something to understand what they're up against. James McAvoy's character is jokingly referred to as an author whose book endings suck (a nod to the book) and unfortunately this film doesn't improve on the novel. It's just an overly long series of vignettes that tie to Chapter One in an unsatisfying way."
It Chapter Two,08-Sep-19,"Everything special from chapter one an both of the originals completely removed for cheap not scary cgi effects, lost it's way for the all mighty Hollywood blockbuster dollar"
It Chapter Two,09-Sep-19,"Well, what can I say. I didn't expect too much,it's difficult to transform a Stephen King book into a good Movie. But it's possible (the Shawshank redemption, Dolores Claiborne, stand by me....)but there is more bad than good. This is one of the bad ones. Lots of jumpscares, all so predictable, I was so bored, I thought: oh please, not another one. And why do they always feel the need to change the plot? For instance the one about Bill not being really sick? Why do filmmakers think they know it better than Stephen King? Or steal from other movies (the Thing) And the end, the end, that was the last straw for me. If you read the book you know what IT really looks like. I was sooo hoping for a fantastic monster (they used enough CGI, didn't they) maybe a little like the Queen in Alien?(the one in the miniseries made me laugh). But no, what a mess. Make the clown small? Really!?
Stay at home and spend the money on the book."
It Chapter Two,06-Sep-19,I couldn't wait for it to end.CGI was horrible at times.Wait for it to come out on video. At least you can pause it and take a break.
It Chapter Two,02-May-20,"The second iteration of IT is between a bad joke and kitschy horror, the kind one laughed at in the 90's. It completely unravels the good work done in the first outing and will go down in history as another of those movies, milking its former glory with a huge cast, thinking that movie watchers will fall for it."
It Chapter Two,04-Oct-19,"'IT chapter 2' is a film based on the Steven King's novels, that was released on screen in order to express the horror that the evil clown exposed in the old town of Derry. The direction is poor, seems like they didn't even try to make it scary or post the image that this story was supposed to show. I remember a scene in the theater where I would laugh to those small babyheaded spiders. The cast looked like they were bored every minute of it, being there just for the title of the film and the publicity it had gained. They did not make any try to act, just reading words and acting accordingly like anybody could do it. The story had some interest but it was all sunk with the terrible acting and directing and at some point took the downroad for good as it seemed like they made it something up to fill it up as they were running out of time. There were many points during the film where I was annoyed, even bored, ready to sleep on my chair, the duration of the film was inexcusable like there were added extra nonsense minutes to it. To sum it up, 'IT chapter 2' is a movie for young kids aged 10 - 14 because they would be the only ones to appreciate it. I would not recommend it for anyone over that age plus I would not pay to watch it again. It was a really bad try, I would add, pathetic at least."
It Chapter Two,05-Oct-19,"This is one of those movies that's built up to be the greatest film to hit the theater in a generation. I remember when the trailer came out--people began to rave about how good this film would be. Well this film sucked. Monumental waste of three hours. It was painful to watch. For lots of reasons. Jessica Chastain mailed it in. Bill Hader echoing F-bombs every other word. Ransome is a guy you want to punch. The only scene I enjoyed in the film was the scene with the old woman-and even that was ruined because the entire scene played out in the trailer. Worst, the movie wasn't even scary. CGI trickery. It was more like a Tim Burton film. And one other thing-the silly, over-the-top attempts at humor greatly diminished the film. For a film positing itself as the scariest adaptation of a King novel, the audience spent far too much time snickering at lame jokes. I want my money-and my three hours--back."
It Chapter Two,06-Sep-19,"Rating 5.6/10
I honestly can't believe these reviews. This movie truly disappointed me. To director Andy Muschietti you should put more scenes about the clown, because i seen the scenes is just little bit. That is exactly what the screenwriter and director did to this failed abortain. This is not horror film. Terrifying, it is not. Scary it is not. There is nothing scary about this movie. There was so much wasted potential here. Consequently i found the movie too long and lost me some part of it. It just doesn't feel like anything great or memorable. Good bye clown and good bye Eddie."
It Chapter Two,15-Dec-19,"It started good but then got utterly painful to watch. Sadly they don't make horror/thriller movies like the good old days. Sigh, at least scary movies had humor mixed in the ""horror"" of it."
It Chapter Two,13-May-20,My whole 3 points just goes to james mcavoy. It was too long. The first 90minutes was unnecessary. Also it wasnt scary after a while i mean heads with legs lots if blood or another disgusting things it was just not scary just nonsence. Sorry for my bad english I couldn't explain myself clearly.
It Chapter Two,08-Sep-19,"The first IT movie scared the bejeepers out of me. I mean what is scarier than a psychotic clown? Unfortunately in Chapter 2 unless you have Arachnophobia this movie will do nothing for you in terms of thrills. I feel that one of the reasons the first movie was so good is because of Skarsgaard's amazing acting as Pennywise. This movie is just CG heavy and very little acting.**Spoiler**
Also on an unrelated note the homophobic hate crime at the beginning did absolutely nothing to add to the film and left my thinking ""why was that necessary?"""
It Chapter Two,04-Sep-19,"Very early on in 'It Chapter Two' there is some wink wink dialogue about an author writing a great book, but messing up the ending. Anyone who is familiar with the 'It' book or original mini-series will know the ending was not well liked. Here now though they had a chance to rectify things, and I can assure you they did. Not just in terms of the ending, but the entire second entry is actually a fantastically made film and in my opinion superior to part one.The film is exceptionally long for a horror movie at nearly three hours. The thing is though I can't see it having the same impact if it were much shorter. There was a lot of layers to fit in. This isn't your average ""fast-food"" horror like the 'Conjuring' universe films. This is as much a drama in a lot of ways as it is a horror. The first half of the film especially. A long time is taken reintroducing us to the characters, showing us where they are with their lives now and building up their résumés again. Then in the second half of the film (and yes I'm talking about almost an entire 90 minutes) the film kicks into hyper-drive with non-stop, in your face horror - and it is a sight to behold.The cast were again all perfectly selected. Bill Hader in particular steals the show. He is given some great one-liners to work with, much the same as Finn Wolfhard was, and he nails every one of them. There is also a great Stephen King cameo. This isn't just a case of blink and you'll miss him, he is given an entire scene with some hilarious dialogue. I wasn't sure whether 'It Chapter Two' would be able to stick the landing and give the story the ending that it deserves, but it certainly did. I had a great time with this movie and I think any lover of the genre will as well."
It Chapter Two,05-Sep-19,"I was very excited to see this film, have been since 2017, when I saw the first one. Unfortunately, this one was a huge mess.I love the way the first IT didn't want to be JUST a horror movie, but rather took time to build up a story, emotional connection. That is what made it so different from all the other horror movies that are being made nowadays. HOWEVER, this was completely thrown out the window in the second one. Considering how incredibly long this movie is, 90% of it was just buildup for jumpscares, jumpscares themselves and weird CGI.The worst thing for me was that there were too many things going on, jumping all over the place. And most of it was just for shock value, nothing important to the story.What I did love was the casting, it was absolutely brilliant, especially Eddie.I guess this is once again a classic case of - bigger budget does not mean better movie, as well as more CGI does not mean better movie."
The King of Staten Island,12-Jun-20,"I have followed Judd and Pete's careers pretty closely so naturally I was exited to see this movie. I wanted to see it in theaters but renting it for 20 dollars in my living room was my only option for now.Pete has proved himself to be a funny guy and a competent actor, and even though he's playing a similar character to his role in Big Time Adolescence, this is a big step forward in his career.I think this movie will probably receive criticism for not being as funny as some of Judd Appatows other movies, but I don't think this movie was aiming for a the same thing as Superbad and The 40 year old virgin. Judd often talks about how the key to making a good comedy is to make a good drama and add humor to it, this is the perfect example.Pete's story is intriguing and feels completely worthy of a movie like this. Some people wanting a non stop laugh fest maybe not like it, and it does have flaws, but I really enjoyed it.This is probably Judds best movie in 10 years. And I highly recommend giving it a watch."
The King of Staten Island,13-Jun-20,"This film is a true gem. I went into it not expecting much, but I was disappointed when the movie was over. Not many films I've seen recently left me feeling that way; especially Davidson's previous film ""Big Time Adolescence"". ""The King of Staten Island"" was funny, heartfelt, and raw at times. Personally, I've always felt like Pete Davidson was the least funny member of SNL, but this film opened my eyes to what he was about as a person and where his comedy stemmed from. I appreciate that the film doesn't pretend to be something different than what it is - Pete's semi-biographical story brought to life by a comedy directing/producing pro, Judd Apatow. The supporting cast of Marisa Tomei, Bill Burr, and Steve Buscemi bring some pretty great performances to the table as well. Great story about that weird part of life in your early twenties where you're still not really sure what you're doing or where you're going on life's journey. It deals with living through loss, growing up and finding out your purpose in the world. I will recommend this to friends!"
The King of Staten Island,13-Jun-20,"The film is unapologetically introspective and raw. It feels amateurish at times, but overall it really works for the story that is being told. More of a drama than a comedy, but with some truly funny moments."
The King of Staten Island,13-Jun-20,A great addition to the Judd Apatow's comedy and sentimental work. Happy to see Pete Davidson succeed in this role. Really happy with this movie!!
The King of Staten Island,13-Jun-20,Bill Burr and Pete Davidson are an amazing duo. I know this is not a type of movie where they would have a part 2. But I would throughly enjoying watching this story continue on with all these characters. It was a little long but you would really feel the emotion between Bill and Pete.
The King of Staten Island,12-Jun-20,"It is a fine day for something funny, relatable and wholesome & ""The King of Staten Island"" delivers a rather enjoyable package in that department. Judd Apatow's most famous include ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" (which I loved) and ""Knocked Up"", and the last before last, whole 5 years ago, was ""Trainwreck"", which I happened to catch on the big screen, it was okay but not a fan... This time around Apatow directs a story co-written with its standout star Pete Davidson, dedicated to his dad Scott Davidson, and quite heavily inspired by Pete's own life. Though not without its flaws, I can tell You ""The King of Staten Island"" is easily my favorite Judd Apatow piece since 2005.To most probably known as a member of SNL, now rising comic, actor and cool dude Pete Davidson is portraying Scott, a 24 year old who has been a case of ADD ever since his firefighter dad died when he was seven. Jobless and living with mom, Scott spends his days smoking bud, hanging out with friends and dreaming of being a tattoo artist. When some new characters enter his life, he is forced to grapple grief, trauma and take his first steps towards redemption. In real life, Pete Davidson's father was a firefighter who died in the line of duty, rescuing victims of the 9/11 attack. Cast member Steve Buscemi used to be a firefighter in the wake of the 80's, and returned to help on the day of the same tragedy.""The King of Staten Island"" is mainly a story about growing up, finding the good things, learning to accept those good things, and taking responsibility over one's life. There's genuine sentiment in its heart, which rests in just the right place, and it can also be legitimately funny. It's not structurally perfect, and can feel a little too scenic, focusing on the quality of separate sequences that do not add a lot of story. The big turning point starts manifesting itself as late as 100 minutes into the movie, and in the end the 2 hour and 17 minute runtime is a little too tall. Having said that, it is a dramedy that's never boring, always pleasantly amusing. This kind of plot, I believe, is pretty predictable by default, so enjoy the substitute, the always-present-low-key-charm. As a 23 year currently stuck in my hometown and great friends with Mary Jane, I felt like an appropriate audience member for ""The King of Staten Island"", and that's what I meant with ""relatable and wholesome"". Some might say that a big part of this movie isn't about a whole lot of anything, but I beg to differ, perhaps the idyllic view on such simplicities tells a lot.I think it's apparent Pete Davidson is a pivotal part of why the movie works so well. In what might very likely be his best performance to date, he plays a likeable, decent guy with a good heart and some troubles in it, plays him so authentically one could guess some of it comes from a place of past pain. But that's not it, the supporting cast delivers well above average performances as well - do not miss the chance to see Bill Burr in a bigger role and rocking an impressive moustache, and the female counterparts for both - Bel Powley and Marisa Tomei, anchor the balance perfectly.Judd Apatow is arguably one of Hollywood Heavyweights, making a film with a cast that don't fall back all that much, so the level of these ingredients resemble themselves also in every technical and aesthetical department. It's visually very well orchestrated, subtle and perfect in its simplicity, never once anything distracting catches the eye. Soundtrack has a couple of real nice tunes in it, of which one dear-to-my-heart nostalgia song ended the film, but I won't spoil it.Even now I wonder why not more, because I really, really dug it, but I believe that it deserves a good, flavorful, perhaps even memorable 7/10. I recommend it, well, just about everyone who's not too young for it, even one point of intrigue is enough."
The King of Staten Island,12-Jun-20,"King of Staten Island is a deeper dive into Pete Davidson, a mostly autobiographical look at why he is the way he is. Well done and well written and a great supporting cast from Bill Burr, Marissa Tomei and Steve Buscemi all were steller in supporting roles.Be prepared, it is dark and not funny ha-ha, but definitely uses humor to deflect uncomfortable situations. Pete's always been an intriguing character to me, so this was a great way to pull the layers back, it's not always pretty, but I think it is definitely worth the price."
The King of Staten Island,15-Jun-20,"I was excited about this movie simply because it's an Apatow product, AND, I'm a somewhat, ""new"", fan of Davidson. I cried through the first viewing, laughed more, but still cried, through the second viewing of my 48hr rental. Well done. Thank you for sharing your story in such a cerebral, human way. I will purchase it as soon as it's available for purchase."
The King of Staten Island,13-Jun-20,"This films intention, is to take you on a journey. It presents itself initially, as a simple character study. As it divulges though. You begin to see that it's actually an examination of the people that interact with the lead and how they effect and are effected by his actions.The quick cuts and edits are a perfect representation, of the ebb and flow of real life and are in no way unintentional or a mistake.The premise and subject matter is not easily digested but at the core is a story of a young man stricken by grief who wants to contribute and find where he belongs.Funny, heartwarming, original and will leave you satisfied after viewing"
The King of Staten Island,13-Jun-20,"I'll be honest...I liked this movie way more than I expected I possibly could. Pete Davidson is great in this and the film is well-written, funny, and touching. Highly recommended weekend viewing."
The King of Staten Island,21-Jun-20,"Three big problems:
1) Pete Davidson's acting was very distracting - Everyone else was great, but his reactions didn't match their actions.
2) Pete's character was way too much of a self-pity cliche - ""Meh, I'm broken, please feel bad for me.""
3) Forgettable - Nothing deep, special, or very interesting happens, and there's not enough funny to make up for it."
The King of Staten Island,13-Jun-20,I enjoyed the cast and was mildly looking forward to this film. But it was way too long and didn't really achieve anything. The love interest. The father and son thing. Living at home. And the mums new boyfriend. But I didn't care about any of it.There are some funny lines in this. Some caring interactions. And an attempt to do things different. But it was a long slog to get to the end. Then when the end did come it really wasn't worth the wait.This is watchable but you won't get too much from it. I suspect a lot of the high ratings here are PR campaign boosters. This is not a high scoring film at all. Disappointing.
The King of Staten Island,12-Jun-20,"If you're in any way a fan of Pete Davidson or Bill Burr, see this movie. Both absolute crush it by pretty much playing themselves.
If you're not a fan of Pete, see this movie. He'll completely change your mind. The anorexic panda that he is."
The King of Staten Island,15-Jun-20,"Don't listen to some of the trolls who reviewed this film. Writing, acting, and directing were phenomenal. Very memorable movie. It's been a while since I've rooted for a main character so much. Great movie."
The King of Staten Island,19-Jun-20,"I've liked some of Judd Apatow's films. I have not seen one thing that Pete Davidson has done that is good OR funny. Even on SNL his humor is sophomoric and imbecillic. Casting him in this feels like it was done more out of sympathy rather than talent. And this was not one of Mr. Apatow's finer writing efforts. Once Pete's tattoos start fading along with his 'career,' you'll likely catch him manning the fry station at Burger King."
The King of Staten Island,14-Jun-20,"Wow did this movie drag. I kept waiting for it to get funny and engaging...but nope. On top of that, Pete was incredibly unlikeable. I kept waiting for his character to morph and learn...but it just didn't happen. Too bad though, I was really hopeful for this movie."
The King of Staten Island,14-Jun-20,"I get the direction in which this movie was trying to go, but it missed horribly. I'm not going to blame any of the actors, but someone is to blame for this swing and miss. Under funded, and a completely unrealistic story... tried twice to watch it and couldn't do it. Really bad."
The King of Staten Island,13-Jun-20,"It's watchable when you have nothing to do, but it's wayyyyy too long. I feel like they lost themselves in totally unnecessary sub plots."
The King of Staten Island,15-Jun-20,"Hard to sit through this ""film"" in its entirety. Ineffective one liners. Grungy looking characters. What a waste of time. I should have been paid to watch."
The King of Staten Island,16-Jun-20,"It's as if every actor here is in a different movie. They are different levels and you can feel it. The writing and story are okay, but there is such a lack of cohesiveness. It's very strange and the effect is a very uneven, unwatchable movie."
The King of Staten Island,13-Jun-20,I'm conflicted because it was a truly likable movie. On the other hand the editing seemed rushed and all over the place. I really liked the idea of the film and I wish it was better executed. Regardless it was enjoyable
The King of Staten Island,15-Jun-20,"I admit, only about 40min in before I just turned it off. Maybe good for someone from the area, but damn this movie was slow and boring, I think I smiled once, but other than that, this just felt very depressing without any real 'focus'If it cannot snag your attention in the first 10-15minutes, its likely not going to get a full view. Maybe next time?"
The King of Staten Island,14-Jun-20,"Just going off of the previews, I thought this was going to have a gritty, indie vibe. Way wrong, just a neutered PG film not worth your time or money. A lot of good acting from the support characters, especially Bill Burr, but the lead tall goofy actor (don't know his name, was told he's from SNL), is not a good actor. Someone with more talent might have been able to save this movie from being so dull. Tim Dillon probably could have pulled it off."
The King of Staten Island,16-Jun-20,"Don't let the fake, 1-week old accounts rating this 9's and 10's fool you, this is a stinker. File this under ""movies that didn't need to be made"". The King of Staten Island is slow, uneventful, but even worse it is a waste of a solid core cast of veterans. Unfortunately, casting Davidson, in what appears to be some sort of ill-advised vanity project, as the lead doomed this movie from the start. How Davidson landed a role on SNL is baffling enough, but how Apatow then thought he was fit to star on the big screen can only be explained away as Apatow owing Lorne Michael a big favor for some past transaction.The rest of the cast didn't fair much better, with the fiery (no pun intended) firefighter played by Bill Burr being the exception. Tomei, who is usually a guaranteed casting choice if for nothing else than the stability her experience provides, also falls flat. Perhaps that's due to the weak writing of which Davidson also took part, or perhaps the film just sucked the life out of her like it sucked the life out of me while watching it.
Finally, the pacing of the movie was sluggish, if not at a crawl at times, and the 2+ hour runtime starts to feel more like 4 hours. It's quite clear that a lot of reviewers (the real ones, not the brand new ones created solely to boost the film's rating) are trying their best to justify the fact that they spent $20 to watch this on their couch...

The King of Staten Island,13-Jun-20,"Not really a fan of Pete Davidson prior to this film and frankly still not a fan of him after it, but I respect his transformation in this movie. If you don't know (which at this point, I'm not sure how you couldn't) Pete's real dad was FDNY and died on 9/11. Whether or not he was able to use this to catapult his comedic career is something I don't know, but I never found him particularly funny. When he first got to SNL I thought he was going to be the next Andy Samberg, but his appearances seemed to fizzle and he was often relegated to doing pre-recorded bits on the show. It made me a little sad because I think his potential was and is wasted at SNL but perhaps it's one of those situations where they can't really fire him due to FDNY connections. I know it sounds kinda conspiracy theory-ish but those are my personal thoughts.Now back to this film. I absolutely hated the first 30-45 minutes and was regretting my decision to watch the film, but I eventually finished it and I actually thought it was a decent story about personal transformation, something I definitely could relate to. Seeing the cherry picked reviews about how it was so funny and Apatow's best film are now confusing as it is neither hilarious or Apatow's best, but still very good. If you're like me and think the first half of the movie is awful, just hang in there and finish it. Everything comes together at the end so the beginning of the movie doesn't seem as awful as it is."
The Shining,27-Aug-00,"When this film first came out in 1980, I remember going to see it on opening night. The sheer terror that I experienced in viewing ""The Shining"" was enough to make me go to bed with the lights turned ON every night for an entire summer. This movie just scared the life out of me, which is what still happens every time I rent the video for a re-watch. I have seen The Shining at least six or seven times, and I still believe it to be simultaneously and paradoxically one of the most frightening and yet funniest films I've ever seen. Frightening because of the extraordinarily effective use of long shots to create feelings of isolation, convex lens shots to enhance surrealism, and meticulously scored music to bring tension levels to virtually unbearable levels. And ""funny"" because of Jack Nicholson's outrageous and in many cases ad-libbed onscreen antics. It never ceases to amaze me how The Shining is actually two films in one, both a comedy AND a horror flick. Ghostly apparitions of a strikingly menacing nature haunt much of the first half of the film, which gradually evolve into ever more serious physical threats as time progresses. Be that as it may, there is surprisingly little violence given the apparent intensity, but that is little comfort for the feint of heart as much of the terror is more implied than manifest. The Shining is a truly frightening movie that works symbolically on many levels, but is basically about human shortcomings and the way they can be exploited by unconscious forces combined with weakness of will. This film scares the most just by using suggestion to turn your own imagination against you. The Shining is a brilliant cinematic masterpiece, the likes of which have never been seen before or since. Highly, highly recommended. - Paul"
The Shining,29-Jun-03,"I can't praise this film long enough!The Shining is, without doubt, one of Stanley Kubrick's undisputed masterpieces and a true classic in horror cinema. It is a film that, over the course of the years, has managed to scare the living hell out of its audiences (and still does). The film is an adaptation of Stepehen King's original novel, written in the late '70s, and although the film is not very loyal to the book, it still stands as a thing of its own.Right from the beginning, as we contemplate the car going to the hotel from those stunning aerial shots, deeply inside us we know that something in the film, somehow, sometime is going to go wrong. As we obtain that severe warning, an almost inaudible voice gently whispers to us 'sit tight', a sense of unexpectedness invades us all, and it is that very same feeling that makes our hair stand on end throughout out the entire movie.
The plot is simple: Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) becomes the caretaker of the Overlook Hotel in up in the secluded mountains of Colorado. Jack, being a family man, takes his wife (Shelley Duvall) and son (Danny Lloyd) to the hotel to keep him company throughout the long, isolated nights. During their stay, strange things occur when Jack's son Danny sees gruesome images powered by a force called 'the shining' and Jack is heavily affected by this. Along with writer's block and the demons of the hotel haunting him, Jack has a complete mental breakdown and the situation takes a sinister turn for the worse.The film, unlike many horror-oriented films nowadays, doesn't only rely on stomach-churning and gory images (which it does contain, anyway) but on the incredibly scary music based on the works of Béla Bartók and on the excellent cinematography (the Steadicam is superbly used, giving us a sense of ever-following evil), as well. The terrifying mood and atmosphere of the film is carefully and masterfully woven by Kubrick, who clearly knows how to really make a horror movie.Jack Nicholson's powerful performance as the mad father and husband is as over the top as it is brilliant. Shelley Duvall, who plays the worrying wife who tries to help her son, is also a stand out; she shows a kind of trembling fear in many scenes and is able to display weakness and vulnerability in a very convincing way. Undoubtedly, The Shining is full of memorable moments (the elevator scene or the 'Heeeeeere's Johnny' one-liner for instance) and, simply put, it's flawlessly brilliant.Stanley Kubrick's direction is pure excellence, giving the whole film a cold and atmospheric look, thus creating an unbearable sense of paranoia and terror. There are moments of sheer brilliance and exquisite perfection in this film; the horrifying maze chase is a perfect example. Every single shot is masterfully created and there are some genuinely scary scenes which will make you sit on the edge of your seat.The Shining is, in my opinion, a special landmark in horror cinema which will always be regarded as one of the scariest movies in film history. Since I saw it last year, when I was 13, I have rarely been able to have a bath in my bathtub.Just in case, ya know. Overall, The Shining is incomparably the scariest film I've ever seen in my whole life (and I can tell you I've seen a great deal of horror films).It is an unforgettable, chilling, majestic and truly, profoundly scary film crafted by an eccentric genius who wants to show that the impossible can be done. The Shining is a sublime, hauntingly intriguing and endlessly watchable film that shows Kubrick at his best."
The Shining,19-Jan-02,"Stephen King may have said the master director knew nothing about horror, but that simply is not true. That is a too biased opinion for anyone to go on given that he wrote the book, which Kubrick based his wonderful film ever so loosely on. And at any rate, faithful or not, KUBRICK's Shining-the BEST crafted genre film of the 80's- performs it's duty as a fright flick, and then some.There are appropriately no words strong enough to convey the haunting beauty of the visuals showcased throughout the movie, from the drive to the Overlook to the final chase in the hedgemaze the movie is a feast for the eyes as it is for the mind. And it IS a feast for the mind as The Shining is as psychological as horror gets, toying relentlessly, and expertly with your emotions and expectations(some could even say SADISTICALLY), throwing something in that's completely out of left field and never, ever letting you catch your breath between the now classic shocks as the movie speeds toward it's memorable conclusion in the last half hour.Kudos are in order for Kubrick, a director of the old school style, who builds an eerie atmosphere by exercising total control over the filmic environment, manipulating everything down to the tiniest detail to suit the needs of the picture, yet filming with a coldly detatched, objective eye, as though Kubrick were making a documentary about these events. This would account for the dialouge, which-thankfully-is not the typical phoney balloney Hollywood banter (Kubrick detractors/King purists usually bitch about this the most, having been weaned on the phony nature of 'Hollywood talk', which is usually nothing at all like real talk. Many of us speak 'on the nose', and do not try to convey subtext through use of carefully chosen words that articulate our state of being without being direct.) In this light, Shelley Duvall must be commended for her performance which is very naturalistic. It does not seem like acting at all. She is not concerned with glamour, nor does she clutter her performance with typical acting chops, but rather she is solely focussed on hitting the emotional highpoints of her character as 'Wendy' gradually comes to realize that her husband is a madman. And let's face it folks, how many of us would like a million bucks when placed in a situation like that? Who does NOT look like a blubbering idiot when they are hysterical? That's what I thought, so what did you expect? She was great. To say nothing of the rest of the cast."
The Shining,09-Apr-07,"Even though The Shining is over a quarter of a century old, I challenge anyone to not get freaked out by Jack Nicholson's descent into madness. This is a rare example of something so unique that no one has been able to rip it off; instead it has been referenced time and again in pop culture. The twins, the elevator of blood, RedRum, the crazy nonsense ""writing""... this should be seen, if for nothing else, to understand all the allusions to it in daily life. The film is simultaneously scary, suspenseful, beautiful, and psychologically intriguing. It has the classic mystery of Hitchcock and the terror of a modern thriller. And it has what horror movies usually lack: a great script."
The Shining,24-Jul-01,"Chilling, majestic piece of cinematic fright, this film combines all the great elements of an intellectual thriller, with the grand vision of a director who has the instinctual capacity to pace a moody horror flick within the realm of his filmmaking genius that includes an eye for the original shot, an ice-cold soundtrack and an overall sense of dehumanization. This movie cuts through all the typical horror movies like a red-poker through a human eye, as it allows the viewer to not only feel the violence and psychosis of its protagonist, but appreciate the seed from which the derangement stems. One of the scariest things for people to face is the unknown and this film presents its plotting with just that thought in mind. The setting is perfect, in a desolate winter hideaway. The quietness of the moment is a character in itself, as the fermenting aggressor in Jack Torrance's mind wallows in this idle time, and breeds the devil's new playground. I always felt like the presence of evil was dormant in all of our minds, with only the circumstances of the moment, and the reasons given therein, needed to wake its violent ass and pounce over its unsuspecting victims. This film is a perfect example of this very thought.And it is within this film's subtle touches of the canvas, the clackity-clacks of the young boy's big wheel riding along the empty hallways of the hotel, the labyrinthian garden representing the mind's fine line between sane and insane, Kubrick's purposely transfixed editing inconsistencies, continuity errors and set mis-arrangements, that we discover a world guided by the righteous and tangible, but coaxed away by the powerful and unknown. I have never read the book upon which the film is based, but without that as a comparison point, I am proud to say that this is one of the most terrifying films that I have ever seen. I thought that the runtime of the film could've been cut by a little bit, but then again, I am not one of the most acclaimed directors in the history of film, so maybe I should keep my two-cent criticisms over a superb film, to myself. All in all, this movie captures your attention with its grand form and vision, ropes you in with some terror and eccentric direction, and ties you down and stabs you in the heart with its cold-eyed view of the man's mind gone overboard, creepy atmosphere and the loss of humanity.Rating: 9/10"
The Shining,29-Oct-01,"When Jack Torrance (Nicholson) is offered a job as winter caretaker for the Overlook Hotel he accepts it as an opportunity to work on his novel in an isolated environment. He is told stories of the last caretaker going mad and butchering his family but isn't deterred. He arrives at the Overlook Hotel with his wife (Duvall) and child Danny (Lloyd) and is shown around the hotel by the cook (Scatman Crothers) who has the gift of perception. The cook warns Danny that the hotel can be of particular danger for those with the gift. It's only a matter of time before Jack begins to act increasingly erratic.This is one of Jack Nicholson's finest roles, his increasingly unhinged character is amusing and terrifying in almost equal measures. Duvall plays the role of the terrorised wife quite well - she does look like she's genuinely filled with fear - but doesn't have much else to do. Lloyd is excellent as the boy, although he doesn't have too much emotion to express. However no doubt that this is Jack's show.The story doesn't stick to King's novel and is better for it; this is Kubrick's Shining. The film has plenty of genuinely scary moments but manages to keep a creepy atmosphere all through - especially as the ghosts come out and Jack begins to move between his reality and the reality that is gradually claiming him.Kubrick is excellent here, his cold direction adds to the overall creep factor of the film. It's one of the best examples of his masterful touch.Overall this is an excellent horror movie - because the focus is on horror and fear rather than gore alone (as with modern horrors). Jack is excellent in one of his best roles ever and the whole package is delivered in a cold creepy manner by a sadly lost director."
The Shining,18-Feb-99,"What can I say about the scariest movie I have ever seen that has not already been said by others more articulate than yours truly?  Do not view this film expecting to see a screen version of the Stephen King novel. Rather, this is a Stanley Kubrick film, and to fully appreciate it one should judge it within the context of Kubrick's entire body of work as a serious filmmaker.  Thematically, THE SHINING relates most closely to 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, though flourishes of PATHS OF GLORY, A CLOCKWORK ORANGE and BARRY LYNDON do manage to figure prominently in the film's overall technique.In a nutshell (no pun intended), Jack Nicholson and Shelly Duvall co-star with Oregon's Timberline Lodge - enlisted to portray the exterior of the Overlook Hotel - in a story that appears on the surface to be about ghosts and insanity, but deals with issues of child abuse, immortality and duality. What the film might lack initially in terms of coherence is more than made up for in technique.  Garrett Brown (the male voice in those old Molson Golden commercials), inventor of the Steadicam, chases young Danny Lloyd through hotel corridors and an amazing snow maze, providing magic-carpet-ride fluidity to scenes that ten years earlier would have been impossible to accomplish.  If the film starts off too slow, remember who the director is.  This man likes to take his time, and the results are well worth it: incredible aerial shots of the Overlook Hotel; horrific Diane Arbus-inspired twins staring directly at us; portentous room 237 and its treasure trove of terrible secrets; elevators that gush rivers of blood in slow-motion; Jack Torrance's immortality found via the hotel (akin to David Bowman's journey through the Space Gate); and some of the best use of pre-existing music ever assembled for a motion picture.It would take a book to examine and defend the film's strong points and drawbacks.  If you've never seen it, you owe it to yourself to watch it alone with the lights off, with no interruptions, and make sure that it's raining.  This is a cinematic experience that changed my life at the age of 14.  Makes a great double feature with Robert Wise's 1963 thriller THE HAUNTING."
The Shining,23-Nov-03,"The Shining, you know what's weird about this movie? This is the movie that everyone, for people who claim to not like horror films, will always say that The Shining is a terrific film. This is Stanley Kubrick's classic vision of Stephen King's horror tale of madness and blood. This is just an incredible film and wither you have seen it or not, you have heard of it, know a few lines from it, and know some of the classic images. Who could forget Jack's ""Here's Johnny!""? Who could forget ""All Work and No Play Make Jack a Dull Boy""? Who could forget that chilling ending? This is the film that is unforgettable and honestly in my opinion is Kubrick's best work. I know there is a lot of argument in that department, a lot of people say it's 2001: A Space Odyssey or Clockwork Orange or even Dr. Strangelove, but if those film pioneered film making, then The Shining perfected it. This is the tale of isolation, madness, terrifying images, and the ultimate ghost story that will crawl underneath your skin. Jack Torrance, Jack's son Danny, and Jack's wife, Wendy arrive at the Overlook Hotel on closing day. The elderly African-American chef, Dick Hallorann, surprises Danny by speaking to him telepathically and offering him some ice cream. He explains to Danny that he and his grandmother shared the gift; they called the communication ""shining."" Danny asks if there is anything to be afraid of in the hotel, particularly Room 237. Dick tells Danny that the hotel has a certain ""shine"" to it and many memories, not all of them good, and advises him to stay out of room 237 under all circumstances. Danny's curiosity about Room 237 finally gets the better of him when he sees the room has been opened. Danny shows up injured and visibly traumatized after Jack tells Wendy that he loves his family. Seeing this, Wendy thinks Jack has been abusing Danny. Jack wanders into the hotel's Gold Room where he meets a ghostly bartender named Lloyd. Danny starts calling out the word ""redrum"" frantically, and scribbling it on walls. He goes into a trance, and withdraws; he now says that he is Tony, his own ""imaginary friend."" Jack sabotages the hotel radio, cutting off communication from the outside world, but Hallorann has received Danny's telepathic cry for help and is on his way. Wendy discovers that Jack has been typing endless pages of manuscript repeating ""All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy"" formatted in various ways. Horrified, Jack threatens her and she knocks him unconscious with a baseball bat, locking him in a storage locker in the kitchen. Jack converses with Grady through the door of the locker, which then unlocks releasing him. Danny has written ""REDRUM"" in lipstick on the door of Wendy's bedroom. When she looks in the mirror, she sees that it is ""Murder"" spelled backwards. Jack picks up an axe and begins to chop through the door leading to his family's living quarters. ""Here's Johnny!"", and Jack's legendary image is born.The Shining is one of those films that you seriously have to make time to see, this is an incredible film and still gives me nightmares. Jack Nicholson's performance is timeless and unforgettable. But one I also feel is extremely overlooked is Shelley Duvall, her scene of finding Jack's rant All Work is incredible, that's a look of horror and you can see that fear in her face after realizing her husband is mad. Also another incredible scene is when Jack sees a ghost woman in the bathtub, it's honestly one of the most terrifying scenes in horror cinema. The reason this film is so well known is because it's a film of perfection, it's been on The Simpsons, it's been shown in other films and it's a film that will forever stay with you when you see it, trust me.10/10"
The Shining,31-Jul-15,"Once again, I decided to check out a highly regarded ""cinematic masterpiece"" and was left kinda disappointed. Scariest movie of all time? No, not really. It wasn't even particularly scary.Admittedly, a lot of it was well done. The little girls were the best part. They were great. The steadicam shots through the hallways were pretty cool. There was a good sense of ""What horrors could be lurking around the corner?"" as the camera follows the kid through the halls.But aside from those things, much of the movie didn't work so well. Jack Nicholson was more hilarious than menacing. Was that intentional? His witty dialogue provided many laughs, but watching him slowly stumbling around holding an axe was hardly what I'd call horror.The story was completely nonsensical. What was any of that? There's no explanation for almost everything that happens in the movie! Here's where I'll probably get derided by the movie's fans for not ""getting it,"" but I'm convinced this is really a case where the movie-makers themselves had no clue what it all meant. They just threw all this random imagery at us just to confuse us and convince us that it's actually brilliant (because if we can't comprehend any of it, it must be brilliant, right?) but really it just makes zero sense.I don't get why this is so highly rated."
The Shining,24-Nov-08,"Sometimes all good horror needs is a good idea. But sometimes, rarely indeed, a horror masterpiece will reach us by the hand of a Kubrick, with the adept, elusive touch of a great artist to guide the vision, and we know what separates it from all else.Okay, the story has enough promise that even a hired gun would have to try to fail. Heck, even Stephen King himself didn't fare so bad. It's how Kubrick perceives King's universe however, how he fills the frame with it, that renders THE SHINING a feast for the senses.Horror that will reach us through the mind and body alike, an assault as it were, tending eventually its pitch to a crescendo, yet curiously not without a delicate lull.Kubrick's cinema is, as usually, a sight to behold. We get the adventurous camera that prowls through the lavish corridors of the Overlook Hotel like it is some kind of mystic labyrinth rife for exploration, linear tracking shots exposing impeccably decorated interiors in symmetric grandeur. The geometrical approach in how Kubrick perceives space reminds me very much of Japanese directors of some 10 years before. In that what is depicted in the frame, the elements of narrative, is borderline inconsequential to how they all balance and harmonize together.Certain images stand out in this. The first shot of Jack's typewriter, ominously accompanied by the off-screen thumps of a ball, drums of doom that seem to emanate from the very walls or the typewriter itself, an instrument of doom in itself as is later shown. A red river flowing through the hotel's elevators in a poetry of slow motions. Jack hitting the door with the axe, the camera moving along with him, tracking the action as it happens, as though it's the camera piercing through the door and not the axe. The ultra fast zoom in the kid's face violently thrusting us inside his head before we see the two dead girls from his POV. And of course, the epochal bathroom scene.Much has been said of Jack Nicholson's obtrusive overacting. His mad is not entirely successful, because, well, he's Jack Nicholson. The guy looks half-mad anyway. Playing mad turns him into an exaggerated caricature of himself. Shelley Duvall on the other hand is one of the most inspired casting choices Kubrick ever made. Coming from a streak of fantastic performances for Robert Altman in the seventies (3 WOMEN, THIEVES LIKE US, NASHVILLE), she brings to her character the right amounts of swanlike fragility and emotional distress. A delicate, detached thing thrown in with the mad."
The Shining,02-Apr-01,"Okay, okay, maybe not THE greatest. I mean, The Exorcist and Psycho and a few others are hard to pass up, but The Shining is way up there. It is, however, by far the best Stephen King story that has been made into a movie. It's better than The Stand, better than Pet Sematary (if not quite as scary), better than Cujo, better than The Green Mile, better the Dolores Claiborne, better than Stand By Me (just barely, though), and yes, it's better than The Shawshank Redemption (shut up, it's better), I don't care WHAT the IMDb Top 250 says.  I read that, a couple of decades ago, Stanley Kubrick was sorting through novels at his home trying to find one that might make a good movie, and from the other room, his wife would hear a pounding noise every half hour or so as he threw books against the wall in frustration. Finally, she didn't hear any noise for almost two hours, and when she went to check and see if he had died in his chair or something (I tell this with all due respect, of course), she found him concentrating on a book that he had in his hand, and the book was The Shining. And thank God, too, because he went on to convert that book into one of the best horror films ever.Stephen King can be thanked for the complexity of the story, about a man who takes his wife and son up to a remote hotel to oversee it during the extremely isolated winter as he works on his writing. Jack Nicholson can be thanked for his dead-on performance as Jack Torrance (how many movies has Jack been in where he plays a character named Jack?), as well as his flawless delivery of several now-famous lines (`Heeeeeere's Johnny!!'). Shelley Duvall can be thanked for giving a performance that allows the audience to relate to Jack's desires to kill her. Stanley Kubrick can be thanked for giving this excellent story his very recognizable touch, and whoever the casting director was can be thanked for scrounging up the creepiest twins on the planet to play the part of the murdered girls.
One of the most significant aspects of this movie, necessary for the story as a whole to have its most significant effect, is the isolation, and it's presents flawlessly. The film starts off with a lengthy scene following Jack as he drives up to the old hotel for his interview for the job of the caretaker for the winter. This is soon followed by the same thing following Jack and his family as they drive up the windy mountain road to the hotel. This time the scene is intermixed with shots of Jack, Wendy, and Danny talking in the car, in which Kubrick managed to sneak in a quick suggestion about the evils of TV, as Wendy voices her concern about talking about cannibalism in front of Danny, who says that it's okay because he's already seen it on TV (`See? It's okay, he saw it on the television.').
The hotel itself is the perfect setting for a story like this to take place, and it's bloody past is made much more frightening by the huge, echoing rooms and the long hallways. These rooms with their echoes constantly emphasize the emptiness of the hotel, but it is the hallways that really created most of the scariness of this movie, and Kubrick's traditional tracking shots give the hallways a creepy three-dimensional feel. Early in the film, there is a famous tracking shot that follows Danny in a large circle as he rides around the halls on his Big Wheel (is that what those are called?), and his relative speed (as well as the clunking made by the wheels as he goes back and forth from the hardwood floors to the throw rugs) gives the feeling of not knowing what is around the corner. And being a Stephen King story, you EXPECT something to jump out at you. I think that the best scene in the halls (as well as one of the scariest in the film) is when Danny is playing on the floor, and a ball rolls slowly up to him. He looks up and sees the long empty hallway, and because the ball is something of a child's toy, you expect that it must have been those horrendously creepy twins that rolled it to him. Anyway, you get the point. The Shining is a damn scary movie.Besides having the rare quality of being a horror film that doesn't suck, The Shining has a very in depth story that really keeps you guessing and leaves you with a feeling that there was something that you missed. HAD Jack always been there, like Mr. Grady told him in the men's room? Was he really at that ball in 1921, or is that just someone who looks exactly like him? If he has always been the caretaker, as Mr. Grady also said, does that mean that it was HIM that went crazy and killed his wife and twin daughters, and not Mr. Grady, after all? It's one thing for a film to leave loose ends that should have been tied, that's just mediocre filmmaking. For example, The Amityville Horror, which obviously copied much of The Shining as far as its subject matter, did this. But it is entirely different when a film is presented in a way that really makes you think (as mostly all of Kubrick's movies are). One more thing that we can all thank Stanley Kubrick for, and we SHOULD thank him for, is for not throwing this book against the wall. That one toss would have been cinematic tragedy."
The Shining,16-Oct-05,"It's well know that Stephen King doesn't like Stanley Kubrick's version of The Shining (so much so that he scripted an abysmal TV movie version). According to him, Kubrick didn't understand the horror genre. Well, I think Kubrick did. I think he understood it only too well. He knew that it was a genre full of conventions, cheap tricks and tired clichés. Therefore Kubrick decided to throw all that nonsense out of the window and make a film based on atmosphere rather than predictable thrills. You don't get people here jumping out of the dark time after time. You don't get worthless shocks. Kubrick's version of The Shining is an insidious film. It gets under your skin. In other words, it isn't for Pavlovian dogs that have spent a lifetime being conditioned by cretinous nonsense.What runs deepest through The Shining is a frustration with family. Right from the beginning it's obvious that Jack isn't happy with his lot  as he's being shown around the hotel he can't help but take a sneaky look at the backsides of a couple of women. Well, can you blame him? The poor man is married to a bug-eyed, bucktoothed Olive Oil look-a-like.Then there's Jack's quiet frustration with his son Danny. As he's driving to the hotel, he's bothered by requests for food. And then his son makes out that he's knowledgeable because he saw a programme on TV. Already he's slightly irked - he's got to spend months alone with these people; one who resembles Popeye's missus and one who talks to his finger.So really the hotel brings out nothing that isn't already there. It merely brings everything to the surface  Jack's resentment as regards his wife, his frustration as regards his lack of writing talent and his annoyance at having a troubled son. It's kind of like he's testing his family. Are they strong enough as a unit to survive being cooped up together?One of the underlying themes in the film seems to be television. What happens in The Shining is what happens when someone stops watching the idiot box. With it, a person can find solace in mindless programming and retreat from the strictures of family life. Without it they're faced with all their problems and all the failings of their loved ones. Even the strongest family can be brought to its knees when there's no escape from each other's company. Therefore it's quite telling, when Jack loses the plot completely, that he spouts lines from TV: ""Honey, I'm home"" and ""Here's Johnny."" Just watch some television, Jack.But it's also the pain of writing that contributes to Jack's insanity. There's nothing quite as harrowing as an empty page. Plus there's nothing more annoying than being interrupted mid-flow. One of the best scenes in the film is when Jack tells his wife to get lost when she interrupts him. It's extremely violent in how cold Jack is towards Wendy. And because it's grounded in a reality, it's all the more effective.Also rather unsettling is the scene where Jack talks to his son. He makes Danny sit on his lap and he proceeds to tell him how much he loves him and how he'd never hurt him. It works so well because it's so cold and because there's such an obvious lack of affection. The words are just empty platitudes. They mean absolutely nothing.Jack's true feelings are only revealed when he gets to talk to Lloyd. It's in this scene that you realise the marriage isn't all it's cracked up to be  Wendy has never forgiven him for accidentally hurting his son. And it's also in this scene that you realise (as if you hadn't noticed earlier) that Jack is absolutely crackers. He's talking to ghosts. But they could also be figments of his imagination, for there are mirrors behind most of the ghosts he talks to. Effectively he's talking to himself. And I love this matter of fact way of dealing with the supernatural. There are no fancy tricks. Everything just seems unnaturally natural.In fact, everything to do with the ghosts is superbly handled. The twins are spooky, Lloyd is amiable and Grady is out of his mind. And it's Grady who's probably the most chilling presence in the film. He starts off as a bumbling waiter but then quickly becomes a stone cold killer. Just the way he says 'corrected' conveys more terror than a million slasher films. And Philip Stone's performance is a million times more subtle than Nicholson's. I mean, as much as I like Jack in the film, he does chew the scenery. But Kubrick likes his over the top performances, so that's the way he wanted it.And undoubtedly it's Kubrick's movie. He's the real star. And I love everything he brings to the film. I love his command of lighting  just look at The Gold Room scenes. I love his use of music. I love the way that he turns the Room 237 scene, one that could have been a standard 'jump' scene, into a comment on Jack's marriage  his willingness to be unfaithful. I love the way that he leaves lots of unanswered questions. I love the shots of the blood coming out of the lift. I love the helicopter shots at the start. I love the way that pages and pages of typed words are the most frightening visual in the film. I love the maze. I love the fact that you see a ghost getting a blow-job from a ghost in a bear suit Man, I love absolutely everything about this film. It's horror for people who know that true horror isn't being stalked by a man in a mask, but being trapped alone with your family."
The Shining,03-May-19,"I had heard so much about how brilliant this movie was. I finally watched it and I hated it.I give it 4 stars and not 1 because I thought it was filmed beautifully and the three leads gave great performances.But now here's what I didn't like.My main criticism is that this movie does not make sense. The story is incoherent and incomprehensible. There are visuals that look like symbolism, but are not related to anything. It looks like a movie that was supposed to be twice as long and was heavily cut, losing its meaning in the process. Maybe that's what happened?Another thing that annoyed me, especially in the first part of the movie, is the editing. Why so many dissolves? It was seriously making me dizzy. Also, the editing of all the dialogue scenes at the beginning, which are already very slow, got on my nerves. This unchanging alternance of reverse shots was making me crazy. In fact, I even wondered if all of this was a conscious choice to unsettle the viewer. But I was mainly annoyed.Last, but not least, this movie isn't scary! Why did I wait all these years to watch it, for fear of being traumatized? Sure there were very good jump scares. But making me jump is not the same as scaring me. Some of the ""scary"" visuals, as I already complained earlier, were so unrelated to anything that they made me laugh rather than scaring me. And I didn't feel any tension because nothing in the story made sense to me. It was all disjointed and weird."
The Shining,28-Feb-05,"I was never a big fan of horror movies. They usually try cheap tricks to scare their audiences like loud noises and creepy children. They usually lack originality and contain overacting galore. The only horror movie i like was Stir of Echoes with Kevin Bacon. It was well-acted, and had a great story. But it has been joined and maybe even surpassed by Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, quite possibly the scariest movie ever.The movie follows a writer (Jack Nicholson) and his family who agree to watch over a hotel while it is closed for the winter. There were rumors of the place being haunted and the last resident went crazy and murdered his family. But Jack is convinced it will be OK and he can use the quiet to overcome his writer's block. After months of solitude and silence however, Jack becomes a grumpy and later violent. Is it cabin fever or is there something in the hotel that is driving him mad?One of the creepiest parts about the movie is the feeling of isolation that Kubrick makes. The hotel is very silent, and the rooms are huge, yet always empty. It is also eerily calm when Jack's son is riding his bike through the barren hallways. Jack Nicholson's performance is also one of his very best, scaring the hell out of me and making me sure to get out once in awhile. My favorite scene is when he is talking to a ghost from inside a walk-in refrigerator.The Shining is tops for horror movies in my opinion, beating the snot out of crap like the Ring and The Blair Witch Project. It may be a oldie, but is definitely a goodie. 8/10"
The Shining,21-Sep-13,"This is probably the most overrated movie of all times. I'm not a huge horror fan and I get scared very easily, but this movie actually made me laugh or sigh in despair about the lengthiness of the scenes and the predictability of the plot. I read the novel when I was a teen and it beat the crap out of me, I still am afraid of bath tubs in hotel rooms (embarrassing but true). The novel is an all time favourite of me and when I read all the great reviews about Kubick's Shining I was really looking forward to see the movie. What a mistake. For all lovers of the book, this is not a book adaptation, Kubick made his own story...unfortunately. Not only does Dick Hallorann get murdered by Jack - the fact he survives in the novel was one of the reasons I loved the book so much, it has after all somewhat of a happy ending -, but even worse, Kubick turned the whole story around and twisted it to an extend where the original plot is hard to recognize. Jack Torrance is very obviously a mad man right from the beginning who very openly hates his wife and kid, so as others have pointed out before, why didn't he leave his family or killed them before. The whole point of the novel, the normal guy and loving father with a hang to alcohol who gradually gets brainwashed by appearances in the hotel, gets totally lost. One might wonder why the movie even needs the whole hotel plot if Torrance is already mad as a hatter from the very beginning. Apart from this, I guess, had I not read the novel I would probably not understand one bit of what was going on with the characters. But unfortunately that's not all. Also the performances of Nicholson and Duvall were so lousy, it really crept me out. I've never seen Jack Nicholson perform so badly, he seemed like a parody of himself and don't get me started on Shelley Duvall. Periodically I thought I watched some amateur actor in a school play. Her adaptation of Wendy Torrance was so annoying I was staggered between the wish of seeing her chopped to pieces and the wish to see her survive and protect her little boy. The character Wendy in the novel is a strong, resourceful person, the Wendy in the movie is a whiny, weak, and extremely stupid person. The fact that she lays down and sleeps while she is trapped with her 'sick' son and a mad man in a hotel with no contact to the outside world is beneath me. The ending is probably the worst part of the entire movie, on the one hand it's ecstasy as the film draws to an end on the other hand it is as far from the original plot as can be which in this case is an extremely bad thing. The only actor that impressed me was Danny Lloyd, apart from the fact that Kubick partly tried to turn him into a parody of Regan MacNeil I think he did a fantastic job for the little six year old boy he was to that time. He seemed like the only natural actor on the scene. All in all this movie was by far the biggest disappointment I've seen for a long time. Save your time, better read the book."
The Shining,16-Sep-17,"The Shining is a masterclass in film-making and a staple of popular culture. I, personally, cannot stand horror films. I don't like to feel scared, and I don't like to have my emotions manipulated by scary monsters, scary music, scary lighting, etc. I feel like horror is an easy genre - it's easy to scare some people, and people go to movies hoping to feel something, so why not fear?But, I had heard a lot about The Shining. I decided I would look up the plot and watch some clips so I wouldn't be caught off-guard by anything, and I could just appreciate the characters, directing, cinematography, etc. Despite knowing everything that would happen, the film was unbelievably engaging. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. Jack Nicholson, of course, steals the show with one of the most iconic performances ever, and the other actors were decent, but the real star was Kubrick himself. Every shot, every set, the sound design, and everything has his fingerprints all over it, and it is such a delight to watch. When Jack advances up the stairs demanding the bat from Shelley Duval, I grinned from ear to ear because everything in that moment was just perfect in film.The movie, like all others, has problems. In my opinion, the Grady girls and the bloody elevator do not hold up. I knew they were coming from the summaries I had read, so I knew what to expect, so the only reason I could see them as being scary or unsettling is if the viewer was caught off-guard. If you're pretty feminist, you're not going to like Shelley Duval's character, as she is a pretty weak character.All in all, this film is fantastically-made, a cinematic and acting delight, and a gripping horror film that is considered a classic for a reason."
The Shining,03-Jul-99,"""The Shining"" is one of the most chilling and memorable horror movies I`ve seen, and I have seen a lot of horror flicks. It may not be faithful to the Stephen King book, but it still manages to have an intensely eerie tone to, even though any traces of a plot are practically absent. Jack Nicholson gives a great performance as always, and his descent into sheer madness is one of the most entertaining things about the movie, especially when he finally snaps, and turns against his own wife and son. Stanley Krubick has been called mysterious, and there is no doubt about it in this movie, almost every scene has some sort of obscurity to it, some mystery, and it forces to the viewer to feel at least a little bit frightened. Krubick is actually quite brilliant in the way he transforms almost every seemingly normal thing into something menacing, such as the snow-bound atmosphere, a set of twin girls, and even some shots of hallways and rooms gave me chills! In a critical way, ""The Shining"" is not a great film, there isn`t much substance, clarity or depth, but at the same time, you can`t help but be engrossed by it`s strikingly different style and effect. ""The Shining"" may not hold up to close fault-finding, but it`s certainly one of the most exceptional horror movies ever made."
The Shining,11-May-10,"I shall never, ever be able to understand the phenomenon known as Stanley Kubrick. When he was on, as with DR STRANGELOVE, he was brilliant. But when he was bad, he was awful.I saw THE SHINING in its first release in a packed movie house in New York City. I had read and loved Stephen King's novel; I am widely read in the horror genre and do not scare easily, but that book gave me the creeps for weeks.Well for all the people who have been raving what a masterpiece this film is, I can only tell you this. The crowd in the theatre started giggling the minute Jack Nicholson appeared on film, and by the time he chased Shelley Duvall up the stairs, the whole crowd was literally in stitches. And I was laughing right along with them. Maybe New York audiences are just jaded; I don't know.Not that this movie does not have some scary moments. Shelley Duvall is rather good when she is away from Nicholson and it starts to dawn on her that something evil is taking over her family and her life. Unfortunately, Miss Duvall plays Wendy Torrance, a strong, intelligent, and resourceful woman in the novel, as a pathetic, whiny ninny most of the time, and by the time Nicholson had her trapped in the bathroom, I am sure plenty of us were screaming for her head. It must be said that this is not the fault of Miss Duvall, a talented and intelligent actress who according to reports fought bitterly with Kubrick over his interpretation of Wendy.The kid talking to his finger is another idiotic and unintentionally hilarious bit of business that was not in the original novel. Why Kubrick thought this was a good idea is beyond me.But let's get down to the real problem: Jack Nicholson. In the right role, he can be very good, though he has never been among my top ten. Jack Torrance is totally the wrong role for him; for one thing, he does not look ordinary enough. But the worst thing is that Stephen King's story was about a man being SLOWLY AND INEXORABLY driven out of his mind. Nicholson goes nuts so early in the film that there is literally nowhere for him to take the character. And Kubrick was either in awe of Nicholson, who was still riding the post-Oscar high from CUCKOO'S NEST, or he just didn't care, or he thought it was scary when it was actually funny. I don't know.As if all this were not bad enough, the whole mess drags on for two hours and twenty-two minutes; this movie practically cries out for a pair of scissors.Some people will feel that I have spat on an icon, I suppose, and they have that right. But Stephen King himself was not happy with this film, and when he finally got the opportunity to re-do it as a television miniseries in 1997, the results were much better. For the one thing that is missing in Kubrick's version is a heart.Anne Rivers Siddons, in discussing her excellent horror novel THE HOUSE NEXT DOOR, writes that the thing about horror is that it smashes people and relationships. Thus the best horror stories are at bottom also very sad (Brian De Palma's CARRIE gets this; Kubrick's film does not). And whatever your feelings about the miniseries format may be, the Torrance family created in 1997 were people you could care about. Director Mick Garris understands King better than Kubrick did, and Rebecca De Mornay, in particular, redeems the Wendy character in a spectacular tour-de-force towards the end. In 1980 the Torrances were figures of fun. Rather like the barbaric Victorian custom of laughing at the lunatics in Bedlam.Awful, awful, awful."
The Shining,03-Dec-19,"As each year goes by, people realize even more just how brilliant this movie is. The Shining unnerves the viewer in a way other horror movies can only try to; its surreal feeling, hidden messages and terrifying performances captivate you and leave you wondering long after the credits roll. Kubrick made a masterpiece, and analyses of this work of art are continuing to find more and more deeper meanings.ANY horror fan, and really any fan of cinema, must see this gem."
The Shining,20-Oct-09,"How this film gained such high praise and notoriety completely escapes me. I have seen hundreds of films, and this is easily the most incoherent, bland, and lifeless piece of work I can recall seeing (especailly by such a renowned filmmaker). And yes, I hated ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" as well. Long, drawn-out, boring, lifeless film packed full of irrelevant imagery and symbolism that amounts to a filmmaker who doesn't know how to tell an intelligent story with solid characters and emotions. That is the same exact problem here.First off, Shelley DuVall added nothing of value to the film. She was blah from beginning to end. No endearing qualities whatsoever. The whole film was a failed experiment thinking that random creepy, irrelevant images coupled with an incoherent story progression devoid of any character arcs would be successful. Kubrick had no sense of scene transitions. He shows no ability to allow one scene to flow into another, to give it fluidity or convey that he has an overall, consistent vision. The inconsistency over what aspect ratio he intended for it is further proof that he had no concrete vision, in my honest opinion. A solid, competent, talented director knows what they want, and are very confident in their visions. They have a very clear idea of how they want things viewed by every audience, everywhere. That's why directors and DPs hate it when their films are put into the pan-and-scan format. Kubrick also fails to have his DP shoot or light 98% of the scenes intriguingly. Watching this, it was like watching an old TV-movie - dull, uninspired, and lifeless. Yeah, the steadi-cams and dolly shots are all impressive, but sometimes, scenes seem to exist just to show off the cool camera moves they can do. Scenes which contribute absolutely nothing to the overall film, in any aspect. Being a filmmaker myself, I am of the belief that every scene should have a purpose to either the plot or characters of the film. Anything else is a waste. And beyond those steadi-cam and dolly shots, it's essentially bland for nearly the entire film. Almost zero interesting angles, and amateurish editing skills. Yawn inducing cinema.Good story progression would show Jack Torrance starting out as a well adjusted, happy family man that gradually descends into complete psychosis and homicidal mania. Instead, Kubrick shows him as already a man dissatisfied with his life, marriage, son, and career. Then, Kubrick just flashes a title card on the screen saying 'One Month Later,' and Jack is already deteriorated towards the verge of madness. That's shoddy storytelling, and a hack's idea of executing a character arc. No cause is given to why he becomes a homicidal maniac. There's also no correlation between all the surreal, nightmarish imagery. It's completely random, and doesn't evolve into revealing a story behind its origins. All this surrealism is just an excuse for it to be labeled 'horror' as it doesn't serve an underlying purpose as to why anything is happening amongst the characters. They don't confront, deal, or resolve the reasons or purpose behind it all. It's just there to make the film bizarre.Now, I don't mind methodically paced films as long as there's a purpose to it all. Any talented editor could make this a much more effective film by chopping a good 35 minutes or more out of it. Horror films require momentum to equal good pacing, and good pacing is necessary for solid tension. Still, even if there was tension and good pacing, fact is, really, there are no endearing characters in this film for me to build any sympathy for. I don't care what happens to them because they're one dimensional, emotionless, weak-willed people. How this family could even co-exist for five minutes is beyond me, let alone how they survived a more than three hour drive up to the hotel in the first place.This film is almost complete trash because it shows the filmmakers have no intelligence or coherence for the movie they were attempting to make. There are enormously better conceived and executed films from this time that proved far more effective. If you want isolation and paranoia, check out ""John Carpenter's The Thing."" If you want surrealism, go rent Don Coscarelli's original ""Phantasm."""
The Shining,31-Mar-08,"Don't get me wrong, the originality of the story is great, mainly because it was done before all of those abandoned but ""haunted"" hotels, motels, houses, whatever kind of building scenario. But I thought the movie moved at a time dragging pace, the whole shot of Danny Torrence rolling around on his tricycle left me wondering...""What was the director thinking?"" A lot of the things that happened in the movie made no sense to me really. The book I thought was much more clear and less abstract on the transformation of Jack Torrence. I also thought the betrayal of Jack Torrence's character was wrong. We essentially knew nothing about him or his family, other than Danny was having bad dreams, then it starts with the Torrence's taking over of the hotel for the winter and Jack has lost his mind.I loved how it was done in the book, you got a good feel for who Jack was and where he had come from and you felt good about him. When they go to the hotel the symptoms Jack experienced where eye widening. He was chewing on the aspirin, losing his temper and getting major headaches, all conclusive to when he was drinking, but he wasn't. I thought the movie missed a little on that. The movie by itself however seemed to want to breath a life of it's own rather than paying homage to the novel it came from. I guess when it came down to it, I really had no care for the wife and child. Danny walking around saying redrum was really one of the most annoying things I have ever had to watch. But because the film was so slow to progress that when the climax finally showed up it failed to make up for lost time and attention.All in all, an O.K. movie, but I really don't see what the hype was all about in the this other than the famous ""Here's JOHNNY!"" line. Watch it if you wish, obviously it has a 8.5 on IMDb for a reason..."
The Shining,04-Jan-08,"I've never been a big horror fan, but I think I'm converting. Knowing the legendary status of ""The Shining"" I chose to watch it on Halloween. I was not disappointed. It's become one of my all time favorite films. I think I enjoyed it as much as I did because it wasn't a simple horror/slasher film. What blew me away was Kubrick's mastery of genre and his ability to incorporate so many different genre conventions into one story.Here are some reasons why I think ""The Shining"" is the Best Horror Film Ever (Contains spoilers):It creates iconic surrealistic images. I will never forget Jack Nicholson hitting the door with the ax, or chasing his son through the maze, or Danny riding his big wheel through the halls.It is also an adventure with a sort of happy ending. The driving momentum of the story is the hope the audience has that Danny and Wendy Torrance will somehow escape the madness. Danny in particular becomes the protagonist that we are rooting for, caught in a crazy adventure that may be a nightmare for him to experience, but is thrilling for us to witness. He must use both his special power and ultimately his wits to save himself and his mother. He saves them with his power by calling the chef who brings them the snow cat. And he saves them by his wits by outrunning Nicholson in the maze. When all is said and done, it's a satisfying adventure. It is also a sci-fi fantasy where the hero has a secret power that gives him some sort of edge in this creepy struggle. Credit for this must go to Steven King, a master of sci-fi horror. By giving the boy supernatural powers it gives him a fighting chance against the horror.It's the best ghost story I can think of. Ghosts in the movie look like real people, making them that much more creepy. Seeing a ghost all translucent and obviously a ghost would hardly be scary because we'd know that they are a ghost. It's the fact that they look real but we know logically that they aren't real that makes them scary. I loved the friendly and cordial British caretaker who slowly reveals his evil madness and gradually influences Jack.It has a slow measured pace, but always stays interesting and entertaining. It's a consistent slow burn. I really don't know how Kubrick does it. He creates a movie that is relatively slow by today's standards, yet the movie doesn't feel like an old film with a plodding pace. It's constantly interesting and continuously revealing tidbits of info, and so compelling in the performances, that we are sitting on the edge of our seat the entire time, wanting to know what's going to happen next.It's more scary than gory. Kubrick relies more on mood, odd/surrealistic images, and brilliant cinematography than gore to make the movie creepy. The parts that are gory are quick and intense flash cuts, given by supernatural revelation. And they aren't typically gross but unusually gross. For example, the only thing grosser than a rotting woman is an old ugly naked rotting woman.It's a unique take on the ""Haunted Mansion"" genre. Rather than choosing a stereotypically scary hotel, like ""Psycho"" or ""The Haunting"" it creates a big luxurious ski lodge, where the horror is lingering somewhere in the big vast spaces and corridors. In other words, Kubrick creates fear out of an environment we've likely experienced, where there's nothing overtly scary, but covertly, our imaginations due us in. We've all been to hotels and motels, and there's something intrinsically creepy about being in a place with so much unknown history. The imagined horrors are far scarier than anything that could be depicted. It has a certain logic that gets more and more hazy as the film descends into madness. Kubrick gives a lot of exposition in the beginning of the movie, laying the ground rules for everything that is to come. We understand that the child has a supernatural gift for seeing things and hearing things. We know the chef shares that power. We know that the hotel has some bad things that are lingering and haunting the place, namely the vicious murder of a caretaker's family. We know that there's a history of mild domestic violence in the Torrance family. Everything plays out through its set-up, while creating more questions than it answers. Like, what is really making Nicholson go mad? What is the blood rushing out of the elevators? Who's the rotting woman in the room? Why exactly is Jack going mad? And eventually, we wonder why Jack's image is seen in a picture from the 20's. The logic keeps the adventure and suspense grounded and the audience involved, while the mystery keeps the horror alive.The movie doesn't rely on conventional camera tricks to scare us. Most of what we think is scary in horror films is really surprise. You know the feeling. You're sitting in the theater and suddenly something comes out of nowhere and the entire audience jumps, screams, and then laughs. But there's nothing to laugh about in ""The Shining."" Kubrick is so confidant that his story is genuinely scary, he doesn't have to trick us into thinking we're scared.In the end, what is horror? Horror is facing the illogical nature of madness and being trapped in it. Our dreams are the most illogical experiences that we encounter on a regular basis, so it makes sense that he would tap into that collective experience for this film. I can't think of a film that better expresses what it feels like to be in a nightmare than this film."
The Shining,09-Jan-09,"I never did understand the appeal of this terrible movie. Mind you, I could probably say the same about most movies directed by Stanley Kubrick. He is one of those directors who produces very long, boring movies that move at a snail's pace and are really difficult to withstand for more than a few minutes at a time. Movies such as 2001: A SPACE ODYESSY, DR. STRANGELOVE and SPARTACUS are examples of this kind of movie.As many other commenters have pointed out, Stephen King didn't like this movie because it was not faithful to the book. In fact he hates it so much that 15 years or so after, he made his own movie entitled STEPHEN KING'S THE SHINING. I've never seen the other version. But anything with his name attached is normally worth watching so I'll at least make the effort to track it down. It really couldn't be any worse than this tripe churned out by Stanley Kubrick.I've heard THE SHINING being referred to as ""scary"", ""terrifying"", ""masterpiece"", ""classic"", ""thrilling"", ""horrifying"" and so on. Yeah right! This movie does not even come close to producing anything equating to those words. The only horrifying thing about it is how it became so popular.Where can I start with the problems of this movie? Let's start with Jack Nicholson. I thought Jack Nicholson was great as The Joker in Tim Burton's BATMAN, but in this he doesn't even seem to be acting. He plays a character who is supposed to become insane as the story progresses. Yet it is very clear from Jack's first scenes that his character has already ""got a few screws loose"". And that stupid ""Here's Johnny!"" line. Was it supposed to be scary? Funny? What? Who knows? It was just downright stupid as far as I'm concerned. Yeah I know it was a reference to Johnny Carson, but what's Johnny Carson got to do with this movie? The answer: absolutely nothing at all.And Shelley Duvall. What can I say about her? She looks like Olive Oyl from the POPEYE cartoons. How ridiculous! Somehow the viewer is expected to believe that her character and Jack are married with a kid. Yeah right! There is no chemistry between the two actors at all.Finally, Scatman Crothers. I have great respect for this actor. He appeared in TWILIGHT ZONE: THE MOVIE and it was one of the very dull segments. Yet his superb performance gave it credibility and the story touched upon my emotions. In THE SHINING, however, Mr. Crothers is there just to be killed and I don't suppose he was bothered about his character being killed off considering how lame the movie is. It was probably just a paycheck used to pay off a few debts. And the ridiculous thing is that the character in question never dies in the book.I honestly can't believe that people think this movie is better than classics such as THE EXORCIST, THE OMEN and THE Texas CHAIN SAW MASSACRE. But yet this movie has a higher IMDb rating and is sitting very comfortably on the top 250 chart. Nonetheless, that won't alter the fact that the three mentioned movies put THE SHINING to shame any day.Stephen King's SALEM'S LOT was infinitely superior to this movie. Personally I think the director of that movie, Tobe Hooper, should have been asked to direct THE SHINING. We would have had an infinitely superior movie. Trust me. I've seen plenty of Mr. Hooper's movies and he very rarely fails to disappoint. THE FUNHOUSE was a low point of Mr. Hooper's career but even that movie looks like Oscar-worthy material compared to THE SHINING.Overall, I would not recommend this at all. I've not seen STEPHEN KING'S THE SHINING, so I can't really recommend it just yet. But, I would recommend checking out some proper horror movies such as SALEM'S LOT, PSYCHO, THE EXORCIST, THE OMEN, THE Texas CHAIN SAW MASSACRE just to name a few."
The Shining,14-Jul-01,"Rarely have I seen a masterpiece of literature turned into a pile of horse manure...PROBLEMS:(SPOILERS)1.JACK NICHOLSON= Hugely miscast.The descent into madness is supposed to be gradual. This Jack looked like he was already going to murder his family.2.SCRIPT=Although the names and basic plot are in place(guy goes loopey in hotel) a lot of the scenes in the film I could not remember reading(eg two girls,blood in lift). Why did Kubrick drift from the book? Mostly, he didn't drift in A Clockwork Orange, so why here?Plus, the characters were one dimensional cardboard cut-outs, so how could I pity them?3.SHELLY DUVALL=Deserved to die, she was that annoying. The Wendy in the book is strong willed and not a pathetic loser. The reason they went to the Overlook was to save their marriage.4.ENDING=Jack did not freeze to death in the snow. In the book, it showed that Jack was still human enough to recognise his love for his son. The ''frozen'' scene here left me with a feeling of disgust that the pinnicale of the book had been replaced for a cheap shock.WATCH THE TV SERIES INSTEAD BUT READ THE BOOK FIRST."
The Shining,27-Feb-19,"I think the title of my review says it all. Kubrick was genius. Full stop. I love Strangelove, it is timeless and brilliant. I love Jack Nicholson, I could watch him sleep and be entertained. Scatman Crothers, also adore. But not this film. I honestly do not understand the high rating. Jack is Jack, and that is great, but from the moment he appeared, there was no descent into madness as per the novel. It was a hysterical performance, literally. His smart ass smile that I love, the eyebrows, glint in his eye, sarcasm, was excellent, but totally not scary. And that is the problem. I know I will get reamed, but this film failed to capture the isolation and suffication of the novel. It is like a collection of scenes. Elevator door opens, oh lookblood. Why??? Why??? Too jarring. Various characters in costumes, never explained. You really have to read the novel to understand the scenes. A caveat: I think the hedge maze was a genius choice and better than the topiary animals in the novel. But why switch from a mallet to an axe? The bartender Lloyd was very creepy. The most incredible and scary part of the film is when Duvall frantically keeps flipping through the typed pages that all say the same thing. THAT was amazing. To be honest, I laughed most of the time Jack was spewing his lines. Well made, but overrated."
Ghosts of War,17-Jul-20,"The first half of this movie is actually interesting and this movie blends a WWII theme with a paranormal theme quite well. However after the initial setup has passed this movie stalls and can't seem to find out how to best continue the action or wrap up an ending. Some jump scares and a few creepy scenes but nothing overly engaging or worth noting.Then it's almost like the director had to wrap up shooting or ran out of money as the ending is rushed and is over in maybe 5-8 mins. Eric Bress writes and directs this and is most noted for the Final Destination series and the Butterfly Effect, 10-15 years ago. Sadly he hasn't created nothing in between now and then and hasn't learned how to create a good ending yet."
Ghosts of War,20-Jul-20,I really don't know what people think they're entitled to see every time they choose a movie. Whoever was responsible for this movie gave it their best shot. Great care was clearly taken in the photography and set design. A story that's a little different with actors who give it their all. Give it a break.
Ghosts of War,18-Jul-20,"This movie started ok. Good acting, good plot, good decor, even the storyline was unusual and a great new idea for a ghost movie.
However, I only have one thing to say about the ending...W...T...F...!!!.
Maybe I missed something, but if that ending would have been different, I would have given 9/10. Too bad !!!"
Ghosts of War,19-Jul-20,"Beautifully shot with great cinematography, but the story gradually disappoints because its thematic ambitions add more clutter than depth to a story that's most effective at its simplest. The convoluted ""twist"" either needed to be omitted, or expanded upon with another 15+ minutes. It's as if the budget ran out and everyone just wrapped it up as fast as they could with no regard for a cohesive storyline. It's a shame, because it had potential. It's a generous 6/10 from me."
Ghosts of War,17-Jul-20,"So the start of this movie was pretty good, acting very good, great story.
Then suddenly it turns things around and you get to know the 'real' story. However, at the very end they just 'stop' the movie and that's it.It could have been so much better, the ending simply ruined it completely for me."
Ghosts of War,29-Jul-20,"As I started watching I just kept thinking why all the negative reviews, this is one of the best war/horror movies. Interesting premise, good acting, chilling atmosphere. I just loved it; but as the movie got to the end, it turned complete 180 & made a fool out of it's audience,the twist was just out of nowhere & completely ridiculous. It's as if the writer hated writing this movie & wanted it to fail. It would've been a fine supernatural horror movie if it stickied to what it started out with; but no, the writer had to subvert the audience expectation. He must've been thinking he was so brilliant to come up with this lame ending. God, what a disappointment, an hour and half down the toilet all because of the ending. A perfectly fine horror movie ruined because the writer had to write this stupid nonsensical ending. What a waste of time & talent."
Ghosts of War,18-Jul-20,Great concept started really good than jumped from scene to scene without any connection like they ran out of money and decided to cut out parts for short run time dont know than suddenly we're pulled out ww2 and into modern day Afghanistan some kind of simulation to help them recover but dialogue was all over the place lead asked to get put into simulation again to save others than as he entered the movie ended without showing how he saved his friends or himself WTF DID I WATCH?
Ghosts of War,19-Jul-20,"If you like war horrors such as The Objective, Trench 11, or The Bunker you will be OK with this. Its competently acted. Actually Kyle Gallner the lead from the mini-series ""Interrogation"" has a major supporting role in this movie. He is a good fit as the enigmatic squad sniper and its worth watching just for him. The horror effects seem a little cheesed but there is a reason for that. The movie has a decent twist to the plot, and for that reason I urge you to stop reading the reviews and watch the movie, as people are saying too much around here."
Ghosts of War,25-Jul-20,"Interesting movie with a good amount of action and mystery. Good story with lots to expect but falls a bit short overall.
But its the ending which is memorable for all the wrong reasons.....basically there isn't one and would benefit from someone explaining it. Not a waste of time, but definitely unsatisfactory because of this."
Ghosts of War,19-Jul-20,"Anyone who's watched more than four or five movies has almost certainly encountered bitter disappointment with an ending. It's common enough that one has to be braced for that outcome with every movie one watches. You know, just in case. GHOSTS OF WAR raises the phenomenon of the bad ending to a religious experience. You know, the one where you shriek ""oh God I'm in hell!"" out loud.The much rarer, even unique, experience that GHOSTS OF WAR provides the viewer is that of seeing a movie that has been sailing along rather well suddenly decide, apparently from instant onset dementia, to commit storytelling suicide in the most grisly manner possible right at the end. It was literally astonishing to see. It was as bad as ""and he woke up and it was all a dream"" but carried to such an astounding extreme that your mind almost refuses to accept it while you're seeing it unfold in front of you. From moment to moment, just as you repeatedly think ""NOW this can't possibly get any worse"", it DOES.For the first hour and twelve minutes, GHOSTS OF WAR is a middling acceptable horror/ghost movie. It has its share of faults and foibles, as does even the best horror/ghost movie, which is apparently the nature of the genre as far as I can tell, but all in all it's reasonably well crafted, has excellent production values, and features a handful of namebrand, well-established actors. I might not describe its build quality as excellent, but it's at least very good.It's World War II and a small handful of soldiers, about five or so as I recall, are dispatched to relieve another small group of soldiers who are babysitting a good sized rural mansion that had been used by the Nazis as a field headquarters. In a bit of foreshadowing, the group of soldiers they are relieving practically run out of the building when our group arrives, departing so rapidly one of them even leaves a personal rucksack behind.Since we know it's a horror/ghost picture to begin with set in a building that's intrinsically creepy from top to bottom with lots of odd bits in evidence that could easily be ghost-spoor, it's not long before the paranormal fertilizer hits the ventilator.The setting is not unique in the genre, of course. Given the stupefying bloodiness of World War II, the widespread sociopathic insanity of the Nazis, the Nazi obsession with the occult, the made-for-a-potboiler level of advancement of the Nazi experimental weaponry, and so on, the whole World War II/Nazi ""thang"" is hyper-ripe soil for any plot line having to do with supernatural horror. And so, as you might expect, the number of Nazi oriented horror pictures became uncountable decades ago. The fact that GHOSTS OF WAR excavated from this particular mine is not a bad thing. It would be hard to argue that the vein isn't endless.And so here's the movie, sailing along, dropping satisfying horror tropes left and right (people being dragged along by invisible hands, haunting scenes of misery and torture being played out over and over in proper paranormal style, bangings and clangings and a large smorgasbord of inexplicable and terrifying sounds, etc.) when suddenly the whole thing detonates with the grace of a pig that swallowed a hand grenade.So it doesn't just have a bad ending, you get to see a pretty darn good movie, in the blink of an eye, just abruptly impale itself on the punji stick of unforgivably bad writing. In my experience, that's not something you see every day. You kind of expect movies that weren't very good from the beginning to have bad endings in keeping with the rest of the movie. It's a whole 'nother thing to see a movie that was doing fine suddenly slam into the ground without warning.I would describe the ending to you but for two reasons.Firstly, it would be like watching a movie that suddenly flings a scene involving coprophilia at you; it was an unpleasant shock to begin with, you didn't want to see it the first time, now you can't un-see it, and you sure as heck don't want to write a description of it.Secondly, if you're the type of person who likes watching train wrecks, and you would have to be to want to see this movie, a written description is just going to spoil the fun for you anyway. Go watch it yourself."
Ghosts of War,17-Jul-20,"I was anxiously waiting for this horror flick, especially in these hard times when you aren't overwhelmed by movies, but it turned out this was a huge mistake.
Since butterfly effect It looks like Eric Bress has forgotten how to direct a good film. His latest flick is filled with poor and lame visual effects, the ghosts are not scary whatsoever, in addition to this there is no any atmosphere and tension in the sequences, last but not least the plot itself is a complete mess.The design of the manor and the production design is nothing extraordinary, to say the least, in some cases it looks pretty bad and cheap-looking.Eric Bress doesn't have the slightest idea how to direct a decent horror movie, the twist in the end makes no sense, it's quite ludicrous and eventually makes this flick far worse than I expected."
Ghosts of War,17-Jul-20,"It started off ok, the ok/meh cast was sufficient (although I find Thawites to be very mediocre, and bland all at once in everything he plays) and the premise was good. But there wasn't enough good acting to get this over the finish line. It felt more meh than anything. And the ending was going well until the very last scene which was absolutely, positively and unequivocally nonsensical. Two stars for the effort but this was definitely a misfire. I guess this was the supposed ""scary"" version of Source Code...but it wasn't."
Ghosts of War,29-Jul-20,"Ghosts of War started out great. It's felt like it could be the prefect combination of Band of Brothers and House on Haunted Hill. The premise is simple: U.S. World War 2 soldiers ordered to hold down a strategic location in France, which happens to be a haunted chateau where Nazi soldiers previously committed horrible crimes. I really had high hopes for this film but as it progressed those hopes diminished. The setting is great and the film relies on appropriately creepy atmospheric tension. I mean they're in a really big creepy castle full of strange occurrence? Whats not to like about that? On top of that, the main cast of soldiers were likable. I enjoyed seeing Theo Rossi, who you might recognize as Shades from Marvel Studios/Netflix' Luke Cage series. Alan Ritchson, Brenton Thwaites, and Kyle Gallner, my favorite of the group who played U.S. army sniper Tappert, where all very good.Unfortunately....and this is a big huge deal-breaker for me, the ending did not live up to the rest of the film. This is me being nice about it. To be honest it infuriated me. It made me feel like I wasted 1hr and 34 minutes getting invested in this story which suddenly transformed into something that I was not expecting nor wanted. All they had to do is stick with the theme of WW2 soldiers stuck in a haunted house during war. That's it. How they managed to ruin the last part of this film defies logic. Someone should be fired over this horrendous decision. I want to recommend it based on how good most of the film was, but the ending completely destroyed my recommendation. Yes, it's THAT BAD."
Ghosts of War,17-Jul-20,"Starts like its an OK movie, starts to drag on, then the disappointment hits, with a really bad ending. That's 2 hours of my life I won't get back."
Ghosts of War,17-Jul-20,"Wow. So this starts out as an interesting movie. You think they made some timeline mistakes citing a couple movies that were made after WW@, but it turns out they didnt.That's the twist.And the twist is really really bad.When you get to the last quarter of the film it's a WTF moment that turns into a Why moment.The entire movies is completely ruined by the ending and the twist. It's moronic. And Billy Zane is in the movie for 5 minutes, in case you were wondering.Can't recommend this flick. The ending was just way too bad."
Ghosts of War,21-Jul-20,The beginning is interesting then it loses all sense
Ghosts of War,22-Jul-20,"Although built to be a horror film, ""Ghosts of War"" is uncomfortable, but does not generate fear. It is something similar to what we saw in ""It"". It has a well-designed photograph and good quality cinematic effects. It had everything to be a class B horror film. However, around 01 hour and 13 minutes it tries to score a ""plot twist"" that, although related to the plot, does not generate any contribution in a horror / suspense film. I felt myself watching ""The I Inside"" (2004), in which I was excited about the narrative and wanted to erase the film from memory when I saw the conclusion. In addition, the final scene of ""Ghosts of War"" can be translated as follows: ok, ... is it over?"
Ghosts of War,19-Jul-20,"Slow build up. I agree with the bad editing in the beginning. But, it wasn't that bad. Ending was unexpected. It was not a waste of time."
Ghosts of War,17-Jul-20,"1. A stupid B movie tried to be an A movie!2. Stupid story, a lot worse than Overlord.3. WWII soldiers had same military training as modern days training or vise versa?4. The mansion is not convincing, not luxurious enough, cheaply made!5. Why the director thought all audiences are idiots, the movie is full of flaws and contradictions!"
Ghosts of War,22-Jul-20,"This movie is simply not good. You're hooked in for the first 20 or so minutes, but halfway through the plot becomes ridiculous. The special effects and CGI for the ""ghosts"" is laughable and the jumpscares are cheap and predictable. The ending leaves you full of disappointment and regret. Save yourself the hour and thirty-five minutes and watch something else. Would not recommend."
Ghosts of War,29-Jul-20,"It was a good movie, good story and satisfying characters until it became a sci-fi film"
Ghosts of War,28-Jul-20,Most of the movie was well done but it seemed like the writers gave up on the ending or didn't know how to properly tie up loose ends so just decided to slap together some random events to end the movie. My biggest question is....why are the ghosts hunting the Americans when shouldn't they be hunting ISIS???
Ghosts of War,27-Jul-20,The movie ends VERY abruptly with no explanation what so ever to the story. It just ruins it.
Ghosts of War,26-Jul-20,"70 % of them have crappy endings. This is possible the worst one by now. Otherwise it looked like a decent A-movie.
Don´t they get that I´m going to avoid movies from that director in the future?"
Ghosts of War,26-Jul-20,"All those given this movie positive reviews must be linked to the production somehow. It had potential, but it seems as if the filmmakers ran out of money and just stopped filming, then decided to put this garbage in the market. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME! There is absolutely nothing gained from watching this ill-conceived drivel."
Snowpiercer,17-Nov-14,"I read about 20 from the currently 350 reviews here and as far as I've seen, nobody seems to mention 2 key scenes which seemed very important to me, so I'd like to add my two cents here, a different attempt of interpretation.First key scene: the teacher scene. We witness how completely the children absorbed the doctrine of Wilford. The train manager became a benevolent deity, the system is never questioned, and the train must go on forever. The teacher is a sycophant, very much like Mason. What future do the children have if they are not allowed to think critical?Second key scene: Wilford's monologue when he explains how sacrifices have to be made (only by others, i.e. the lower class). If the system can only continue by murder, then mankind survives by inhuman means, although Wilford sees himself not as the leader who created the train and the system, but as just another cogwheel in the machine. Therefore he expects that a younger man might replace him when he is too old, without any change to the system. He cannot imagine any alternative, but others can. In conclusion, what matters is that the train must be stopped somehow to get out of this treadmill. Other reviewers have asked: is it possible to survive in the cold outside, wouldn't it be safer to keep going with the train. I think they fell right into the trap here that the movie makers prepared. Because just like the train is going in circles, returning every year to the same places, we are living our lives in circles, safe but in a society that loses its social qualities, as you can see quite often in the treatment of children or elderly people, for example. The revolution, as the film makers describe it, wants to break the circle and start a new life that may be less safe, but challenging and more human. I think people who ask: ""wouldn't they freeze to death outside?"" take the allegory too literal again. The frozen world outside represents the unknown, something you take careful glimpses at from the window, but whether it's 5 degrees below zero or 25 is hardly the point. The train itself was a better allegory than a ship or an airplane, because these do not strictly stay on the same tracks when they sail or fly around the planet. The polar bear at the end shows that life outside is possible, but one must try and face the unknown instead of continuing the same old evil.I liked 'Snowpiercer' a lot as it gives much food for thought, but I wouldn't call it a flawless masterpiece (voted 8 of 10). The killer shooting through the window, the decadent upper class passengers in swimming pools or the traitor among the lower class passengers are too much of movie clichés. The question of how food is produced was answered much more terrifyingly in 'Soylent Green' decades before, in 'Snowpiercer' it was just good enough for a quick shock effect. But don't these little niggles stop you from watching this very interesting movie."
Snowpiercer,22-Mar-14,"The only reason I am writing a review right now, is because of how stunned I am at most of the user reviews. While its good that you enjoyed the movie, I am surprised at how most people here are overlooking some of the pretty terrible choices. I will be going through what I thought worked, and what kept me from enjoying the movie. Needless to say; MASSIVE SPOILERS AHEAD.The good: I like the plot, for the most part. Although I find the idea of a train being humanity last home extremely weird, it makes for a nice backdrop. The tone of the movie reminds me a lot of The Hunger Games. Chris Evans does pretty good. The wagons themselves have amazing character. The Art Director should be praised the most out of the entire film crew.The bad: Well, let me sum it up in questions. Questions keeping me from loving this: 1. Why divide the train into classes? This makes no sense. The train ecosystem would function fine with some rules regarding population control. 2. Their great plan is to have a regular uprising to kill off people and keeping the population down? WHAT? See my first point. 3. They used to eat people and babies, but are now disgusted by eating protein bars made by cockroaches? How does that work? And furthermore: 4: WHERE did all those bloody cockroaches come from? 5: If you've invented perpetual motion; why the hell use it in a train? Why not use it to power a generator in a camp, or heat a underground city? The train is death on tracks, with ice regularly blocking the path. 6: Why is everyone on this train ready to kill? Seriously, 90% of EVERYONE is ready to throw down here. 7: People take loosing their limbs SHOCKINGLY well in this movie. Like it's just a flesh wound, really. 8: What the hell happened with that one bad guy who got stabbed through his guts and choked? He just gets up? Why did the korean guy stop his girl from stabbing him? And the korean girl later misses him by 7-8 shots? Furthermore: Tilda Swinton gets a knife through the leg, but walks fine right afterwards.9: Those weird antics of the characters. The woman in the yellow dress licking her blood off her fingers. Tilda Swinton with her strange comedic performance (although I did like the character, I found it a bit distracting), that incredibly weird Korean couple acting all over the place, things like the masked guy just smiling at Evans when they are sitting down. Sometimes I felt like I was watching Charlie and the chocolate factory. 10: The starved people of the tail takes out an army of axe wielding fighters with night vision? After apparently yelling for help through the entire train, and a kid lighting a torch, and running up to them in no time? Stretching it thin, movie! 11: The soldiers had bullets, but they weren't using them at the ONE PLACE they needed bullets? Are you serious?? 12: The shootout between Chris Evans and what I can only assume was Terminator. On opposite sides of the train, probably 1000ft from each other. Sniping with a submachine gun. Through a blizzard. Nice aim there, fellas. 13: Mr. Terminator shooting his comrades all the time. Seriously. What was to be gained from that? He did it several times. Who is this guy?? 14: The only way the train can function is to stuff small kids down small holes to keep the engine running? Really? Was the train designed to stuff small kids down there, or did it just appear to be the perfect solution? How convenient. 15: The wagon closest to the engine is the RAVE-CLUB where all the freaks go to party? Incidentally, the elementary school is next to the slaughterhouse.16: There is no policy on drugs on this finely tuned train? Everyone just goes buck wild with this incredibly potent drug next to the engine room? And furthermore... 17: The drug of choice is basically C4? And it just lies around everywhere - again - next to the engine room? 18: Why not pay attention to what the korean guy is doing to open the doors and then open them themselves instead of having him slow them down? 19: The people with axes putting fish blood on their weapons before fighting? That was random. 20: The other wagons are TOTALLY unaffected by the explosion in the first wagons. Wow. They don't really notice until they derail. What a masterfully crafted train. 21: I know it fits with his story, but did Mr. Evans really need to sacrifice his arm to pull that kid out? He could probably stop the machine with something else than a limb and take better care of that child. 22: The people who jumped off the train still haven't been covered up by snow after 15 years in a never-ending blizzard?Those were some of the things that stopped me from loving this movie. It just got too dumb. There was definitely something here, and I feel this could have become an excellent movie with more thought put into it. It came off extremely unrealistic. And in sci-fi, it's all about fooling the audience into thinking it could have happened. That's the ""science"" part.All in all though - probably an entertaining movie if you'e not a nitpicker like me. Thankfully a lot of you aren't :)EDIT: Someone corrected me in that the couple were korean, and that one of the bad guys never takes a bullet, like I thought he did. Sorry about that, but it still seems far fetched."
Snowpiercer,16-May-19,"I don't like movies as art. I like movies that have rules and internal logic, and the premise of this movie is idiotic from both a scientific and common sense angle. It really works though. Like it really works. If you can just suspend disbelief and accept that a train can run forever and sustain some sort of biodome indefinitely then this movie is a masterpiece.I see reviews where people basically complain about how the premise impossible, or that the themes are cliche, and I'm totally with you guys there. Both of those things are true, so if you need realism then you probably won't like this movie. But if you can just accept the premise as it is then this movie is something really special. One of the better movies I've watched in a really long time"
Snowpiercer,04-Aug-15,"I noticed that people seemed to rate this film either quite high or extremely low and reading the reviews, I can see that those who rated high and those who rated low were watching completely different movies. A huge part of the negative criticisms for this movie is the prevalence of plot holes. These are absolutely undeniable. The concept is far-fetched, the execution bizarre, and the upper class characters quite comical. The key to appreciating this film is understanding its purpose. Snowpiercer is clearly a social commentary, but going into it expecting a Hunger Games sort of dystopian social commentary, you are absolutely going to find it ridiculous.Instead, a much better genre match to this film would be Brazil. Its absurdity makes it even more horrifying. The fact that there is no true logic, the contrast between the dingy tail section and the bright colors and extravagance of the front, and the utter hopelessness of the plot make this movie, yes, bizarre to watch and difficult to relate to. However, the alienation of this world from ours brings out the social commentary and the cautionary tale within.Another up-side was the diversity presented in the train and the framing of women WITHOUT the male gaze! All in all, I was pleasantly surprised by this film and my only real criticism is that it was way too long."
Snowpiercer,02-Oct-14,"Snowpiercer was a surprise to me. I thought it would be just another ""social commentary"" dystopian film trying to ride the coattails of The Hunger Games craze. Instead what I ended up getting was one of the best post-apocalyptic films I've ever seen. A smooth roller coaster of action and quiet, dark dialogue.And don't get me wrong, it is another ""social commentary"" dystopian film, and yes, perhaps it's riding The Hunger Games craze just a little bit. But, when that riding ends up producing a film of this quality, is it a bad thing? And it's not like The Hunger Games invented the idea of alternative future where the poor are trying to usurp the rich people that are controlling them from their towers of ivory. These are both just variations of Orwell's 1984, which draws heavily from the age old tale of the underdog, David versus Goliath.It's the execution of an idea that makes or breaks a film and here that execution is nigh flawless. Everything from the design of the train to the A-list cast of actors to the storyline that keeps up the relentless pace, but still has time to reflect on the motives, histories and moods of the characters.Snowpiercer is simplistic art. It doesn't try to win you over with limitless of details, high explosives or flashiness. Rather it takes a central idea and fills it with as much quality as possible. Highly recommended for all fans of science fiction out there."
Snowpiercer,31-Mar-14,"Very disappointed would be a good summation for this film especially considering it's early rating here. Once the review process has exhausted the fans and people who haven't seen or heard of the comic are reviewing it I expect it'll fall like a stone.The major flaws as I see them (spoiler alert!). The whole concept of a train being the last salvation of mankind on a frozen planet is just beyond belief. Where does the train stop for servicing to it's undercarriage etc. without any stations? Who maintains the track? An engine that runs on magic as much as anything! Why not make it nuclear or at least something believable. If you were to set up a society in a closed environment why wouldn't everyone have a purpose with controlled breeding rather than be lugging around many people with no contribution to the whole. Why would you engineer a rebellion to control population? There are many better ways. Why would you expect some rebel to want your top job doing things your way? The very word rebel suggests that a change of system is wanted.Major flaws aside there are other issues with the film. The characters are not believable. They belong in the comic it's based on. Nobody has made any effort to translate them to film or realised that some adjustments are even necessary. Film requires a different approach and nobody who made this film understands that. A great example of how to do it right is Dredd. This is a great example of how to do it wrong. The film tries to open up great philosophical issues but fails to do so due to the setting they are working in, ie a comic book. You continuously think that none of this is real and so pay no attention to the great moral dilemmas they are trying to foist on you. It's akin to being lectured by a 10 year old.On top of the major flaws there are many minor ones. I'll just give the one example of the hero of the piece stuffing his arm in a moving machine to save one child (didn't bother to look for anything better suited to the task such as a steel bar) whilst then dooming that child to death with everyone-else.The one redeeming quality of the film is it's well made. It's not remotely enough to save it from being a turkey though."
Snowpiercer,28-Mar-14,"I actually like this genre of film, but this was a lousy attempt from this studio. In my opinion there simply are to many things we as viewers are expected to go along with. Without any explanation. Don't agree with me? I will give you some examples then (MAJOR SPOILERS);1. Why did they need to eat each other at the start of their trip, and then suddenly this protein bar-machine appeared. It seems hard to accept that the magnificent Wilford would make this train with room for this low-class people, but with no way to feed them. And how did they make this bug-protein-bar machine while traveling at such speeds?2. Having this class-system and using riots as a way to kill some of the population, seems a very cruel and inefficient way to keep the trains population regulated. And not to mention risky, after all this ""grand plan"" is what sets in motion the events that lead to the trains demise. There are tons of other option that history has shown is better ways to handle situations like this. And what about just plain simple birth regulations? 3. What does the engine run on? Hopes and dreams? explain please. Nuff said.4. How those no part of the railway the train runs on gets destroyed or needs fixing during this 18 year long train ride? In an such extreme climate some part of the rails are bound to be somewhat damaged. 5. At the end of the movie they step outside and into the cold ""harsh"" weather. And let me just tell you. We call that summer in Norway, not an apocalyptic freezing weather. There truly need to be some better way to deal with the problem of this ""extreme"" weather. (and yes i know it was the middle of the day and the weather was nice, and maybe its worse at other times and blah blah, but still, doesn't seam to make sense.)'6. The peoples behavior wasn't believable either. First of all, we need to remember that it was an closed environment, and people in the different classes all knew each other. And when after 18 years on this train some of the upper-class people see these dirty, bloody and new faces, they don't seem to give one single f**k. Not one single one of them. And why did Curtis choose to destroy the engine, the only thing that was keeping all the people on the train alive, to temporarily save one kid? He basically doomed the whole train, including the child he just saved. (And don't get me started on how he did it, jeezez.)The list of these ""What?!"" moments just goes on and on and on. Some are short and brief, but others (like the examples i have given) are major movie-enjoyment-destroying. The sum of all these moments just leaves you with an bad feeling when you are finished watching the film. BUT, the movie ain't all bad. This fictional setting of the film, makes for a type of film that is enjoyable. But often it boils down to; Are you able to believe the case that the film presents, or do you find it just to unrealistic to bear with. At the end of the movie, where all was revealed, the ""mind blown""-moment. I just sat there with to many questions and a big ""what?!""- expression. And not the ""I-just-got-my- - head-exploded-""What?!"", but the what just happened ""what"". And that the reasons why all this things had happened was the general premise of population control, wasn't mind blowing material, if you ask me."
Snowpiercer,02-Oct-14,"I was really looking forward to this film. I love post apocalyptic stories, I didn't think it would be amazing, but I certainly thought it would be better than this. I have never made a review on here before, I have only rated films/TV shows. But I felt compelled to after watching this and noting the major, numerous gaping holes in this film. WARNING: SPOILER ALERT!!1) If this Wilford guy knew this C4 gas or whatever was going to turn the world into an ice- age why didn't he do more than just build this train? He talks about this engine being eternal - so why didn't he use it to power an underground city, with actual space to move?2) Who maintains the train and the tracks? In 18 years no repairs have needed to be made? None whatsoever? In this post apocalyptic ice age there is no damage? I don't think so!3) Why was there no explanation as to how this engine actually works? Literally, no explanation whatsoever. 4) The poor need to be routinely killed by allowing them to uprise so they can be slaughtered? What kind of idea is that. Why not suggest a child policy?5) Why was a class system needed at all on this train. No explanation as to why they couldn't be put to work to be productive members of this ridiculous train society!6) Who were the bad guys who dressed up with night vision goggles? Why were they so ready to kill? Which class were they a part of? Do they have a back story?7) How did the fire reach from the back of the train to the carriage where they were fighting so quickly?8) Why was Tilda swinton who played mason stabbed with a knife in the leg but could walk fine in the next scenes? And why did she randomly take her teeth out? And what were he weird little speeches about?9) There are apparently first class, economy and the freeloader sections if the train? But where were the economy passengers? 10) Where were the animals that produced the meat for the refrigerated meat section and why couldn't you see their breath on there - surely it was cold. 11) Where were the chickens that produced the eggs? Where were the cockroaches coming from that made the protein bars? Oh and where did the rice come from that went with the sushi? 12) They have a dentist, a tailor, a hairdressers, jacuzzi, sauna, bar, a nightclub and a crack den but no nice bedrooms for first class? Where do they sleep? Note there are the bedrooms next to where the protein bars are made but there is no explanation as to who stays there and they were a bit grey and small to be first class accommodation. 13) Where did the kids go that were being taught in the school. Curtis didn't pass any of them again while going through the train. 14) Why did he waste all his bullets trying to shoot the bad guy through windows of the train? How dumb was that?!15) Why did that bad guy live through so much? We literally saw him die. We saw it happen. He was stabbed in the side and died. But all of a sudden he stands up and walks and pulls out the knife no problem and has enough energy to have a full on fight for no apparent reason. 16) Who was the woman in the yellow coat? What was the point of her?17) Why were all the people from the nightclub suddenly wielding axes and chains? Because the two Koreans stole their drugs? Really? Why is everyone so excited to kill on this train that is the last hope for humankind? Why couldn't the girl kill anyone whilst shooting about 8 times into that crowd?18) Why did Wilford want to give up his job as engine commander. He says it's was because he was old but he only looked 50/60. What was so demanding about sitting there that meant he couldn't do it anymore?19) Why did that kid ignore Curtis like he was brainwashed and walk into that weird engine thing that popped out? And what was he doing in the engine thing? And why was he in a cupboard? And why did he come out at that moment? 20) Why did Curtis chop off his arm to save a kid when they were about to blow up the train anyway? Why not use one of the weapons that were around a lot of the film to put in between the gears to take him out? Or not bother at all. 21) Why would they blow up the train? For what reason? What possible good could come from that? Curtis had the power in his hands and he could have made this little bizarre train world a better place, but nope - let's derail the train and kill everyone with an explosion!22) What the hell are that teenage girl and little boy supposed to do now? She just killed everyone on the train and if the cold doesn't kill her and that boy then the polar bear will probably kill them! And again no breath! It's meant to be freezing cold and they couldn't stretch themselves to make the actors' breath visible! Poor!On the plus side the garden and aquarium sections looked nice...DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM!"
Snowpiercer,23-Jun-16,"Let's get this out of the way. Yes, this is my first review. I've watched about half of IMDb's top 250, and did like most of them. Somebody brought this movie to my attention, and as a 7/10 I didn't have high expectations. Honestly, though, knowing this is at least an attempt at some sort of allegory, most of the plot holes are kind of petty and minor. Comparing Snowpiercer to ""The Room"" (don't watch that) because you couldn't tell how someone would have an Irish accent, or realized that the premise of this movie is brutal and inconvenient - is kind of realizing the problem with 99% of all movies altogether.For anyone brutally bothered about plot holes, tell me, is The Hunger Games more logical? Ant-man? Even Inception, the Dark Knight, or Lord Of The Rings? You can't blame a movie for plot holes, rate it a 1, and then ignore those same plot holes in every other movie in existence. By that token, any and all of the Star Wars movies should be rated a 2.No. People here are nitpicking, and that's a nice way to put it. You don't know how the cockroaches kept spawning? Jesus, maybe they breed fast. I have no idea. But then you should point out that Yoda's aches and pains should have technically kept him out of commission years ago, Jack Sparrow should be dead, Captain America has no sources for his morals, Harry Potter makes no sense, and any and all plot holes about Mordor that you can find online.But do they? Nope. Most of the negative reviews here are a one-show, leading me to think there's someone with multiple accounts and a large amount of time to hate this movie.I've seen quite a few sci-fi films - I'm no newbie to the genre. But their are always plot holes in those films, at least technical ones. Faulting Snowpiercer (an allegory, of all things) for having plot holes that are granted in other movies is just not right."
Snowpiercer,15-Apr-14,"¨Know your place. Accept your place. Be a shoe.¨I was pleasantly surprised at how well Korean director, Joon-ho Bong, made the transition to this his first English language film because the style and tone of the film still felt entirely Korean despite starring some well known Hollywood actors. I enjoyed this film so much that I ended up watching it twice and that is something I rarely do. Based on the French graphic novel, Le Transperceneige written by Jean-Marc Rochette, Snowpiercer is an ambitious dystopian sci-fi film that despite having a very absurd premise works really well thanks to Bong's direction. It has some great performances with memorable characters, several exciting action scenes mixed with bizarre comedic moments, and a thought provoking metaphor on classicism. It is a bleak film but Bong handled the material so well that it kept me engaged and interested. Unfortunately the film does suffer from a rather unconvincing final act, but for most of its running time I was so entertained that I wasn't too disappointed.Snowpiercer takes place in 2031 after a failed global-warming experiment has frozen all of Earth and wiped out all life. The only survivors are the passengers of a super train traveling across the globe with a perpetual-motion engine. Designed by Wilford, an engineer who knew the experiment would fail, the train has been running for 17 straight years and a social class system has developed as the passengers of the rear end live in extremely poor conditions. Here we are introduced to a young man named Curtis (Chris Evans) who is trying to come up with a plan to get past all the security guards in order to reach the front section where Wilford is presumed to be. He isn't alone on this quest as most of the passengers are upset for the abuse they've suffered and the extreme poor conditions in which they are forced to live in. A wise old man named Gilliam (John Hurt) who helped Wilford design the engine, has been helping Curtis rally the men together. Curtis's good friend, Edgar (Jamie Bell), is also awaiting the moment to begin their revolution as things begin to get worse once the guards take a few kids away from them. Tanya (Octavia Spencer) and Andrew (Ewen Bremner) are among the victims whose children have been taken away from them so they are also eager to attack. The first step of the plan involves freeing Namgoong (Song Kang-ho), a prisoner who has a special gift for unlocking the doors to each section, but the task won't be easy as the guards will do what it takes to make sure they stay at the rear section of the train.Bong has directed several successful Korean films like The Host and Memories of a Murder, and in his first English language film his style remains untouched. Despite having some scenes that borderline in the ridiculous he somehow manages to balance those moments really well. For example there is this huge action scene that he has set up between the rebels and the guards who are awaiting them with axes. The bloody and violent confrontation begins, only to be interrupted as the train is approaching a bridge which serves as a landmark for the New Year. The fighting stops for a few seconds as everyone begins the countdown and admires the view of the outside world from inside the train, then the violence and mayhem continue. There are several moments like this where Bong perfectly balances these gorgeously crafted choreographed scenes with moments of quirky comedy and twisted sense of humor. The best example of this type of humor comes from the two characters played by Tilda Swinton (who is unrecognizable in this film) and Alison Pill who are terrific and steal the few scenes they are in. I really loved that classroom scene that felt completely out of place with the dark tail section of the train. I think it was those goofy moments that I enjoyed the most in this film. It was a great sensory experience to get to follow these characters through each section of the train and I have to give Bong credit for his visionary style because as our heroes progress to the front of the train things begin to get more and more bizarre and you never know what to expect. The film is short of being a masterpiece because the final 30 minutes are disappointing, but as a social satire Snowpiercer worked better than other recent sci-fi films like Elysium. It is a very weird and strange film, but it is really good and I enjoyed it even more on my second viewing."
Snowpiercer,09-Apr-14,"Spoilers - but seriously that in itself is a joke, the plot, acting, and script is so insanely stupid it cannot be spoiled any further.With so many good reviews I can only think that its the emperors new clothes effect, oh look its semi Korean sort of, and has oh such important things to say about humanity so it must be good! Get a goddamn grip people its just sh*t! I love post apocalyptic films, social satires and commentaries so this looked good on paper. Apart from the whole humanity on a train thing, I mean that just sounds stupid and pointless. But I was sure that would get explained in some clever way soon into the film. It wasn't. Nothing was. At all. There is no point to this film. The whole plot comes to zero.Putting aside the stupidity of the premise that a train could run for 17 years in a frozen dead world where track maintenance guys are all dead, and of course the premise that living on a rapidly moving train would somehow be better than building a base, the plot holes in EVERY frikkin scene is staggering. Continuity is non existent. The heroes are fighting a horde of people on second, the next they have simply disappeared.The rich have meat and wine from thin air, and party on drugs. No-one does any useful work apart from about 5 conductor types. The poor do absolutely nothing apart from whine about oppression. The speeches given by Tilda and Ed Harris are so monumentally derivative and dumbed down its insulting, apart from which they make no practical sense in reality. Ed Harris must be desperate. John Hurt even more so.The hero ends up derailing and entire train, killing everyone except a teenage girl and a 5 year old. They have approximately 10 minutes to live as they've just seen a polar bear who is probably very hungry. Well done hero guy! I've just wasted 2 hours of my life. Don't waste yours."
Snowpiercer,06-Dec-13,"After graping the global movie universe's attention with ""The host"" (2006), Korean director Bong Joon-ho serves up his first offer in the English language with ""Snowpiercer"", a futuristic, sci-fi fable as well as a hybrid of art house and mainstream thriller.The micro depiction of the macro human race is through the titular vehicle (literally meant) – a train that circles the post-apocalyptic world, a frozen hell resulted from the backfire of an over-executed maneuver in battling global warming. Secluded from the outer world, the survivors are stratified by social class, the highest at the front (a perpetual-motion engine) and the lowest at the back. The linear (in more ways than one) story is quite simple, the underprivileged bunch at the back fighting its way, car after car, all the way to the front to gain control of their own destiny. Through the allegory progression, the audience witnesses a rich pageantry of environments – rough workplace, lush greenhouse, giant aquarium, plush lounge, and more.The impressive cast is well assembled. Chris Evans sheds his ""All American"" heartthrob image to play this perhaps his first heavy-weight role as an earthy leader of the revolution. John Hurt is the semi-disabled wise old man, a rich reservoir of knowledge. Other key members of the group include Jamie Bell as the young follower, Octavia Spencer as a mother searching for a missing child ""drafted"" by the ruling class for some obscure purpose, and Song Kang-ho as a Korean security expert. The show-stealing personas, however, are on the opposite side. Most delicious is Tilda Swinton, barely recognizable with ingenious makeup (essentially of a dental nature) playing the spokesperson for the dictator. Allison Pill (so impressive as Zelda Fitzgerald in ""Midnight in Paris"") is another manifestation of eccentricity, a pregnant kindergarten teacher, all sweetness until she produces a gun and starts shooting. The dictator is competently played by Ed Harris.The movie is quite long (a little over 2 hours) and does not hurry itself as most blockbuster thrillers would do. Instead, it takes its time with careful, well-crafted character development. But it does hold the audience's attention with excellent acting and artsy photography."
Snowpiercer,01-Apr-14,"Third class on a train never felt so bad. No private rooms or showers, and just one item on the menu. Don't even think about filing a complaint with the conductor's black-clad goon squad; they don't take kindly to dissent. But that's not the worst of it: you'll never get off this train, since it comprises the only habitable environment left on earth after global warming countermeasures triggered a new ice age.While the setting of Bong Joon-ho's film incorporates a few original ideas, much will seem familiar to the post-apocalyptic film audience. Society is divided between the first class minority, with their fine tailors and cocktail parties, and the downtrodden masses, with little more than the rags on their backs they can call their own. Of course, revolution is in order, but the plan for regicide will require a trip down the length of the train, with a few bloody battles and the discovery of what life is really like ""on the other side"" filling in the remainder of the story.Class struggle is naturally the topic of so many sci-fi films, from classics like ""Fahrenheit 451"" and ""1984"" to contemporary derivatives such as ""District 9"" and ""Elysium."" So taking up such a topic is a little like opening a hamburger joint -- you really have to do it well, and ideally provide your own twist, to have any hope of impressing your clients.Unfortunately ""Snowpiercer"" follows the tried-and-true formulas a little too closely to inspire, and it's hard not to feel like we've been served a Big Mac of a film. There are caricatures, not characters: the hero who doubts himself, the naive sidekick who worships his idol, the wise octogenarian guiding the flock. There are even a couple of video-game references thrown in for the kids in the forms of a martial arts expert and the ""boss"" who comes back from the dead. We share in the characters' wonder about the extravagant lives of passengers in the front cars, but little else drives the plot. The script reads like something written by a non-native speaker, quite honestly, and, as with other films that aspire to the demands of an international box office, the writers settle for brevity, simplicity, and imitation where tactfulness and originality were called for.I didn't see Chris Evans in ""Captain America,"" but I imagine that your appraisal of his acting in that movie might go a long way in determining whether you like his role in this one. In my mind, Evans does little more in ""Snowpiercer"" than dutifully recite his lines and chop down some bad guys, but judging from box office returns these days, that's not necessarily a bad thing.For those who want to step outside the boundaries of Hollywood, I heartily recommend you skip this film in favor of Bong's earlier Korean works, especially ""Barking Dogs Never Bite,"" ""Memories of Murder,"" and ""Mother."" Those films are wonderfully crafted windows onto Korean society that touch upon real divides between class and generation instead of the roughly hewn metaphors we endure in ""Snowpiercer."""
Snowpiercer,08-May-19,"I rarely write reviews and will keep it brief. It's a fun movie! It's by no means the best, but an enjoyable story to watch. A lot of the bad reviews really do bang on endlessly about it not being believable. It's not, it's science fiction, why does it need to be believable? Seems like there are a lot of train fans getting their point across such 'the under carriage would need to be serviced'..... for those less uptight about train stuff, give it ago. I nearly skipped it because of the low reviews, glad I didn't; the higher star rating is definitely earned."
Snowpiercer,24-Mar-14,"First I want to say that this is one of the best (and entertaining as hell!) social commentary films I've seen since Terry Gilliam's Brazil and Paul Verhoeven's Robocop. Yes there are a lot of plot points that don't make much sense if looked at from the perspective of our ""reality."" But this film does NOT aim to be ""realistic."" In fact, I'd say the goal of the director is to make it as ""surrealistic"" as possible. And I applaud him to be so successful in that: in many moments during the film, I felt I was experiencing a fevered dream of a fried fish. -- That's how insane this film is. It takes great genius to present something as insane as the plot of Snowpiercer.This film will be remembered, analyzed and revered for a long, long time. The icing on the cake is that the social commentary content is actually intriguing. The film is decent enough to leave enough ambiguity so that the audiences can make their own conclusions. 9 out of 10."
Snowpiercer,17-Aug-13,"Absolutely amazing. A cinematic microcosm of society. For those of you uninterested in topics like '1984' and 'Animal Farm', watch this film for a hazard course in understanding the human condition. From start to end you see a small-scale depiction of society from it's most basic 'proletariat' level, right up to the elite, in perfect order. And we see the evolution of civilisation from simple beginnings to science, education, quality, luxury, then hedonism, wastefulness and eventual demise, in exactly that order.All of that can be overlooked, however, if you're just the average movie-goer who simply wants a good story with a hero, an adventure and an end goal. In which case I say the film is a good one but nothing special in that respect. Certainly there were parts where I thought, ""eh?"", until it clicked later that it was all part of the Director's greater cinematic design.But for the arty film student types, this film is sure to be the topic of many, many essays for years to come.Clearly every part of the film was deliberate - every shot, every line of script, every item in the background. It was true art. None of that quick-buck profit-incentive Hollywood stuff.In conclusion I recommend this film to everyone, particularly people who want to learn something or gain some insight from what they watch. For the everyday movie-lover, go into this with an open mind and have a really long think about how you can compare it to the world today.Top stuff, 10/10"
Snowpiercer,31-May-20,The film is too boring and illogical. Total waste of time.
Snowpiercer,12-Aug-13,"Wow, i honestly did not expect much from this movie from the trailer. The message seemed one dimensional, and the whole 'action' bit from the trailer wasn't really that impressing. Only thing that dragged me to the theater was the director's name (also the great cast), and i am happy to say that i'm pleasantly blown away by director Bong once again. The movie looked great, the first half was beyond thrilling, the acting for the latter half was just, top notch, the action was bloody and fantastic, and most of all, the ideology behind the story was interesting to say at least. I can't really say anything more than that since saying anything beside the trailer would be a dead giveaway, but really, wow. I honestly don't know how the director's unique style and choices would get to the American audience, but as a person who enjoys this strange and beautiful execution of director Bong, this movie fulfilled everything i want from Bong's film an intellectual Sifi movie. It gave me a handful amount of things to think and talk about, and those kinds of movies always give me the best movie experiences. Definitely one of the must watches of this year."
Snowpiercer,05-Apr-14,"No pacing, no decent dialogue, no characterisation, no decent action. No surprises. It's completely pointless and non-sensical.There are so many plot holes and impossibilities, even within the world of the initial premise, that right from the first line you understand that the only way you can get anything out of this stupidity is to follow along with the heavy-handed allegorical message. Unfortunately the film never waivers from the allegory even when you get the message after ten minutes. Still waiting for plot surprises? Sorry there won't be any. The only point in waiting for the end is just to see what happens. Trust me, if you having washing to do, do that instead. Spoiler Alert ! It's not worth finding out who lives, who dies and what happens to the kids.If you like allegories may I suggest Animal Farm, the Bible, the Matrix or the Wizard of Oz. Avoid this, unless perhaps you're high on plastercine. It's dreadful, one-dimensional tosh.Spoiler alert! And where on earth were the chickens?"
Snowpiercer,03-Nov-13,"No spoilers here !Remember Metropolis, the great silent film by Fritz Lang, and probably the most revered science-fiction film of all times ? Well, if Snowpiercer is not such an absolute masterpiece, I do believe it's the best reiteration of the same concept that made Lang's film so unique : asking questions about the condition of mankind in a futuristic society, and how it does and does not evolve as compared with current times. It's good that not all near-blockbuster scale sci-fi movies do not come out of Hollywood anymore. Snowpiercer is based on a long-forgotten 70's French graphic novel. The Korean director got his hands on a bootleg translation in a Seoul bookshop while filming The Host and got totally hooked. The end product is a French-Korean production, in the making of which one of the authors of the original graphic novel got directly involved. The plot is simple : ecologist freaks have pushed governments to unleash a gas in the atmosphere to control global warming, this proved so effective that the world is now a standalone, snow-covered giant ice cap. The only survivors are all aboard a revolutionary train that goes on and on making loops around the world. It's like Noah's Ark, but including the politics that come with it : first class, second class, workers, fraudsters, the ticket is your fate - for generations. And the consequences are extreme, to such and extent that you can't conceive. Prepare to be shocked at times. Imagine the vertical multistoreyed humanity of Lang's Metropolis, the horizontal way. Some of the tail section fraudsters decide to rebel against their condition and progress to the head car of the train regardless of the risks. Every car they go through bears its grotesque and mind-bending surprises. And tells us more about how this society actually works and what it relies on. This film has style. Even though it reminds of Gilliam (see 12 monkeys) and Matsumoto (Galaxy Express), there is real personality and originality. CGI is limited to a few breathtaking scenes that really add up to the storyline. Acting is mostly excellent, especially by Ed Harris and John Hurt. But most importantly, this film triggers reflection, soul-searching and debate like true Sci-Fi gems should. Unlike most Hollywood movies, it is not Manichaean : the story and morals are complex and debatable. You heart keeps swinging for scene to scene as you learn more. The ending asks a lot of questions. All in all, when the end credits start rolling, it's a film you want to rewatch, not because you haven't understood, but because you want to understand more, and experience more."
Snowpiercer,25-Mar-14,"After years this is movie which make me open account here at IMDb. Why? Well i couldn't believe such high ratings for this movie. Terrible screenplay, terrible story, completely without logic and common sense, so full of contradictions. Favorite character: unkillable bad guy, no meter you stab him, choke him, bleed him. He is, like one reviewer here nicely notice,Terminator. There is no info why the Korean girl is so terrified of him or why he is so obsessed to kill her but not rebellion leader(Chris Evans). And end of movie when they just blow the doors causing train destruction.There is so many logic flows in this movie. Whats the point of all of this. Just pass this, there is much more better time wasters than this one terrible movie."
Snowpiercer,11-Mar-20,"I like the idea of this movie, but I can't get past all the things that are unexplained. Not to mention how things are supposed to work in this movie. There is hardly any world building, and I don't feel anything for the characters. Like the guy talked about almost eating a baby who was a character in the film. I had no idea who that character was!I also don't like how in your face the movie is about its message either. This is the second Korean film I've seen lately with a dumb ending.I'd say it's worth one watch if you're into this kind of genre though. But have some drinks at hand. I kept reaching for my Ipad as I watched, I was that disinterested.Also, the audio was very low at times. I had a hard time hearing some of the actors speak."
Snowpiercer,26-Apr-14,"How to start this? I think I'll begin with the people who haves this movie a decent review. A lot of reviewers said this was a microcosm of society and the struggle of the rebels showed the climbing through the classes of to the ultimate end which is demise. These people also weren't concerned with the functionality of this microcosm and some even said it would have ruined the film if it was explained. Sweet Jesus lord Buddha Allah Yahweh!I hope these people are never in charge of this fictitious realm that indulges psychotic caste behaviour. We'd all be dead in a week or they would be and humanity would have fighting chance. Which is what this movie implies. Do not fight, know your place and shut up. Although the balance of power makes absolutely no sense in film. The well off out number the unfortunate at least 2:1. Which in a balanced system of hierarchy doesn't happen. There need to be more workers to provide for the upper class. This didn't exist in this story. The overall end game is to maintain humanity in a suspended state with rebellion as regulation to preserve a class system. Know your place. However there is no economic system presented to maintain it. How they select the uppers and the lowers isn't explained. Which brings me back to the people who would find this movie profound. Lack of understanding for the more important self. The scientific laws on this train do not apply. Logic, mathematics, physics, chemistry basically anyone who made it to grade nine should see canon sized holes in this story. Leave aside the perpetual motion machine. A train can't contain industrialized mechanics for a recycling system. Sources have to be introduced for a human organism to be supported. There would have to be scientific control in closed system other than a woman reading a book while the oranges grow. Where is the cockroach harvesting car? The aquarium car must be maintained by the sushi chef. The cleaning products must come from the ammonia produced by recycling urine. The bar gets its alcohol from the engine fumes or that muck the kid was cleaning out. The track that never cracks could be maintained by.... I've run out magical solutions. The idea behind this movie is to demonstrate we are all flawed and try to maintain order in what we think society should be, but it doesn't embrace those flaws. It ignores them and does whatever it can to fight those flaws with no common good. It takes for granted how things are done and who is doing them. Everyone is in it for themselves and will rip apart anyone who gets in their selfish way. If you truly found this movie to be good you are already on that train at the end of humanity and you will not survive that way. It means you already take for granted your own life and all the little white lies you tell yourself are as big as that landscape out of that trains window. That train should have stopped and as someone suggested use the engine to build a sustainable society instead of bombing head on into oblivion with no end in sight. Ultimately this movie could have ended no other way with a failed attempt at maintaining a snooty, greedy, childish society with no responsibility but to its own anal stage of development"
Snowpiercer,22-Mar-14,"If you thought that Neill Blomkamp's ""Elysium"" was a bleak enough dystopia, brace yourself for Bong Joon-ho's latest film. ""Snowpiercer"" is what George Orwell would write if he wanted to set ""1984"" aboard the mad Blaine the Mono from Stephen King's ""The Waste Lands"". Grim and fatalistic, this picture packs a chilly, compelling punch.The apocalypse has already happened, with the planet transformed into a frozen block of ice over the next twenty years. The last dregs of mankind sought refuge aboard an ever-moving train (the titular ""Snowpiercer"") barreling through the icy landscape. The central conflict of ""Snowpiercer"" deals, of course, with a major class struggle, with most of the refugees hunkering in the ghettoized tail section of the train. The privileged few live in the front cars (I'm sure any similarities to the basic concept of the bus boycotts that started the civil rights movement are intentional), and the ragged masses congregating in the rear are sick of the oppression, and rebellion begins to foment.The de facto ""Everyman"" leader is Curtis (Chris Evans), a taciturn fellow who quietly waits for the right time to strike. In the meantime, he acts as a big brother figure to his friend, Edgar (an eager Jamie Bell), while enjoying camaraderie with his fellow ""tailies,"" including sweet-natured mother Tanya (Octavia Spencer, an unexpected but wonderful addition to a dystopian drama) and wizened elder Gilliam (John Hurt, always expected and always welcome in a dystopian drama). Almost immediately, this feels like a futuristic retelling of a drama set on a train bound for Auschwitz.Indeed, any time the boat is rocked, Gestapo-like representatives from the front come to admonish the poor, huddled masses. They are headed by Mason (a wickedly over-the-top Tilda Swinton, who might very well be the most fiery character in the film), who seems to relish in her duties, which include forcing miscreants to shove their extremities into the frigid wastes while praising the all-powerful Wilford, the ""Big Brother"" figure of this story who inhabits the very front of the engine. Wilford also seems to order the cherry-picking of certain tailie children, never to return. Eventually, Tanya's son is taken, which sparks the revolution, which encompasses the first half of the film with vicious, ""Oldboy""-esque brawls and rapturous moments of rebellion (there's one scene involving a kid running through darkness with a fiery torch; I swear, all it needed was a Vangelis score to complete it!). Once they have gained the upper hand, the rebels enlist the help of an drugged-up Korean engineer (Kang-ho Song) and his daughter to help them in their quest for the front.""Snowpiercer"" is beautifully imaginative with its rather simplistic story, and indeed, Bong Joon- ho gets to assemble a hodgepodge of dystopian bleakness and utopian bliss. Full credit to the set designers for creating distinct ""levels"" the further up the train our heroes go. And indeed, the Holocaust references really do hit home as the film goes on. One car, for instance, involves children being indoctrinated about how great their glorious leader Wilford is with a Hitler Youth-esque sort of rigmarole. Indeed, the fact that the cheeriest spot in the entire train is the potential source for future atrocity and oppression is made abundantly clear, and the pregnant, propaganda-spewing teacher (a beamingly insane Alison Pill) is ten times more terrifying than the axe-toting guards sent to subdue the revolt.Chris Evans makes for a wonderfully stoic protagonist, and even though the role could easily fall into bland territory, I feel that his inherent ""American""-ness that made him a wonderful choice for a certain Marvel hero hearkens back to the days of Charlton Heston. That said, he gets a heartfelt soliloquy in the end that stands as his finest bit of acting to date. The rest of the ensemble fleshes out their characters quite wonderfully; special mention must be made to Swinton's slimy Goebbels-esque surrogate, Spencer's lived-in dignity that aided her so much in ""Fruitvale Station"", and the appearance of a certain actor at the very end that puts a face to Big Brother at last.There is naught a dull moment in ""Snowpiercer""; by the halfway mark, so much has been packed in, and yet at the same time, it never feels too much. Harvey Weinstein wanted to cut twenty minutes of footage from the film and add a voice-over. ""Snowpiercer"", like ""Blade Runner"" thirty years before, isn't as inaccessible to audiences as one might think. It knows exactly what it is, exactly what it wants to be, and exactly how to show it. It may lack the spit-shine polish of ""Blade Runner"", but it makes up for it in sheer grit."
Snowpiercer,29-Jan-14,"We are recently getting blockbusters that tries to make allegories out of Sci-Fi high concepts about society's lack of equality between rich and poor. Not all of them worked since most of them just used the subject as a petty background and lets the technical wizardry do much of the work, which ends with a silly insincere sentiment. Snowpiercer might do the same as 2013's Elysium or Upside Down did, but this is an ambitious picture that takes the idea seriously. It doesn't let the special effects or the action take over the experience and instead gives away the pain and humanity of the world's living dystopia. Snowpiercer is often cold (no pun intended) and satirical, yet downright affecting with lots of intriguing ideas wandered around.It may feature a train and it is mainly about a revolution attacking against law enforcers and powerful men, but the scenes when it focuses on the characters are actually the greatest strength here. While it acknowledges their suffering and longing, it takes a lot of time to express about what they've been through. And those small scenes of humanity simply makes it remarkable. The film benefits by its actors. Chris Evans is always a great leading hero, and he brings enough impact to the character Curtis. His co-stars, such as Jamie Bell, Octavia Spencer, John Hurt, and Kang-ho Song, also bring lively personalities on their roles. And much energetic and fun performance from Tilda Swinton as the maniacal villain.It becomes a little bit clunky when it hits to the middle act. This is when the characters are just passing through from room to room. Once again, the titular world of a concept didn't get a deep exposition despite of its intriguing features and interesting caricatured social commentaries. At least the production made the internal Snowpiercer train look fascinating. The action scenes are fine, if not messy. There are inventive battle scenes to be found here and there. However the direction's best way to deliver tension is by taking time to breathe in its dark moments of upcoming merciless violence; easily better than the knife wielding, bullets flying battles. The special effects are cool (no pun intended) enough to keep things large and stunning.Snowpiercer is honestly a fresh experience for a Sci-Fi blockbuster. The genre tends to just blow things up, but here it rather brings more soul than extreme panache. The film looks really good, but there are more interesting things to think about other than the technical stuff. The contents and the themes are the core here, if only they could explore more of the train, but for now the characters' feelings is the epic ride, fighting off the dark side of humanity. Despite of some missed opportunities, its rare quality is already enough to make it recommendable. Because there are bigger things in movies than just visual effects."
Radioactive,07-May-20,"The movie is ok. Actors are great and the science part of the story, though they don't show much.
BUT for some reason it cuts to the future (multiple times) to the a bomb drop and Chernobyl but it fails to show the governments and companies involved, so sort of implies Madame Curie is reasonable for those events. Which is ridiculous. It's like saying Newton is responsible for all plane crashes because he discovered Gravity!"
Radioactive,25-Jul-20,"It's not clear what message they are attempting to send in this film. Are they trying to convey that Marie Curie was a genius, or an idiot? At one point in the film, people are already making claims that radiation is causing health issues. Long after that concern is expressed, Marie is still sleeping with, and apparently (at least sometimes) carrying around, a bottle full of radium (almost like it is a talisman). And yet she then tells her daughter that should doesn't won't her working in any radioactivity-related research, because radioactivity could endanger her health. Having not read any biographies about Marie, I just can't help but wonder if any of this is based upon factual evidence, or is it all just embellishment for dramatic effect?And then, the film is interleaved with numerous future events, in the midst of telling Marie's story. Each of these segments depicts mostly horrific events related to future uses of radioactive-based inventions, e.g. nuclear weapons, a nuclear reactor meltdown, etc. What does any of that have to do with Marie Curie? She didn't INVENT radiation. Radioactive material simply exists, and she just happened to discover some of its elements. Showing all of those future events sure seems to send a mixed message, seeming to imply Marie Curie's culpability in those events (which is, of course, ridiculous). Each of those future insertions just seemed completely unrelated to telling her life story, and they were (in my opinion) simply a waste of time, and a useless distraction.The film has some excellent actors in its cast, but I just felt like they were misused, giving you only a shallow and confusing look at the life of this important scientific pioneer. I don't mean to imply that it is unwatchable, but as someone else has already said, it seems more like a soap opera than a legitimate biographical account."
Radioactive,02-May-20,"Marie Curie became more prominent after her death especially around the early years this century, so a film about her life and achievements was a welcome view. There are a few changes in the facts, probably to make this move more dramatic, but perhaps the book from which this film derives, was written like that. The tough days in Marie Curie's life when she arrived in Paris is hardly touched, which undoubtedly lead to her stubborn attitude which is over characterized in this film. In real life she was not such a hard and difficult person."
Radioactive,20-Jun-20,"A distinct lack of PPE but it still wouldn't shield you from some pretty poor editing and a story condensed into 100 minutes about a great woman who deserves so much more but seems to get the blame for Hiroshima, Chernobyl as well as errant husbands."
Radioactive,20-Jun-20,"Although the movie title is 'Radioactive' I though it was the story
about Marie Curie and I'm disappointed that so much included was not related to the research / achievements of Pierre and Marie Curie e.g. the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima and the Chernobyl disaster - neither of which are related to Polonium or Radium (which were discoveries of Marie Curie) The only thing they have in common is that they are 'Radioactive'."
Radioactive,01-May-20,"This movies takes a heavy duty subject, interesting mostly only for those who care about science and scientific leap-of -progress and attempts to turn it into something fit for public consumption,... oh and of course pressed into 110 minutes.
Valiant effort, but it fails at mostly everything except some decent visuals, the science gets butchered (starting with omitting the co-Noblist Jacques Becquerel entirely) , scientific history gets butchered massively - possibly offending scientifically minded audiences - , the story stays utterly tepid and lukewarm, loving clicheed imagery of France and grows utterly trite when the movie tries to depict Pierre Curie as stealing Marie's thunder at the Noble price after fighting valiantly to get her included in the honour in the first place and flat-out lying about the whole procedure and Marie's presence ..... and even Rosamunde Pike struggles with what the director requires of her to carry especially with some of the most forsaken dialog possible. One clearly notices the director visualized this as facts-poor graphic novel.The flash-backs and flash-forwards do stray in the realm of the overly melodramatic, driving home some binary, un-nuanced and utterly stereotypical assumptions (there is a short flash forward episode showing Chernobyl which given last years NF series feels utterly silly ) , and looses what energy it had extremely quickly after Pierre Curie passes out of the storyThis bows too much to current Zeitgeist and ignores realities and established facts about real events, loosing the outstanding contributions Marie Curie made to science in the process .That would have made a spectacular movie.
This ? This I would not recommend it even as a hagiographic biopic"
Radioactive,14-Mar-20,"Rosamund Pike has a penchant for playing determined women navigating oppressive male-dominated environments, from the femme fatale of ""Gone Girl"" to war photographer Marie Colvin in last year's ""A Private War."" In the latest example, ""Radioactive,"" Pike delivers a powerful embodiment of another tragic hero named Marie. As pioneering physicist and chemist Marie Curie, Pike delivers a dazzling performance rich with the struggles of a life defined by perilous discoveries and great personal loss. As directed by Marjane Satrapi, this discursive biopic struggles whenever it cuts away from her drama to explore the bigger picture - with peculiar flash-forwards to a nuclear future - but Pike helps fuse it together. Unfortunately, the movie's unorthodox structure stumbles when it veers off on heavy-handed tangents to explain the reverberations of the Curies' research. Pike remains a compelling figure into old age. Anyone unfamiliar with the Curie family legacy will certainly find much to appreciate about their various accomplishments under incredible personal duress and tremendous social upheaval. So overall, this is a gud moovie."
Radioactive,18-May-20,"For a historical figure with an impact as significant as Marie Curie, this is a really underwhelming biopic. Stale, rushed and lacking any insightful emotional depth, Radioactive is a dull watch throughout, failing in its attempt to capture both the significance of Curie's discoveries and her own personal struggles.It's so strange how poor this film is, given the immense talent behind it. On screen, Rosamund Pike and Sam Riley star, while Persepolis director Marjane Satrapi helms the film. Yet despite that talent, Radioactive feels almost amateurish at its worst.Its screenplay is poor throughout, from its lack of dramatic insight to its consistently terrible dialogue. The early moments of the film are insufferable, chronicling Marie's meeting with future husband Pierre through scenes of awkward and forced scientific flirting.Later on, Radioactive tries to grab your attention with its assessment of the standing of women in the scientific community, but does little to make that theme really get under your skin. In fact, the most memorable part of that theme is Curie's repeated assertions that it was not her gender that stood most in her way as a scientist at the time, but her background and funds.And with relatively little focus on her background, there isn't much of an inspiring, uplifting arc for Curie here. Instead, there are a few eureka moments interspersed by long, dry and dull periods with barely any memorable drama to show.Even stranger is the way in which the film tries to represent the long-term, controversial effects of Curie's discovery of radioactivity. Almost randomly, the film throws in bizarre vignettes from the future showing the uses of the discovery for good and bad, including the bombing of Hiroshima and the development of nuclear weapons.That all but ruins any narrative flow in the film, only reinforcing the fact that Radioactive really is a bit of an amateurish work. Marjane Satrapi's generally unappealing style and drab direction do little to keep you engaged, while even leads like Sam Riley and to an extent Rosamund Pike are below their best.It's a real shame, because it's clear that Marie Curie's is a great story, and with so much talent working in this film, you would expect a whole lot more from Radioactive. But, as a painfully dull, stale and even amateurish biopic, there's little positive to say about it."
Radioactive,22-Jul-20,"Greetings again from the darkness. There can never be enough movies made or books written about remarkable people with incredible accomplishments. Marie Curie was certainly a remarkable woman and her accomplishments were such scientific break-throughs that we are still using them today. Director Marjane Satrapi's (Oscar nominated for PERSEPOLIS, 2007) film is based on the 2010 book ""Radioactive: Marie & Pierre Curie: A Tale of Love and Fallout"" by Lauren Redniss, and the screenplay was adapted by Jack Thorne (THE AERONAUTS, 2019).The film opens in 1934 Paris, and we see an enfeebled Marie Curie (Rosamund Pike) collapse and get rushed to hospital - a sequence used by director Satrapi as a framing device. The film quickly flashes back to 1893 when a headstrong and brilliant twenty-something Marie Salomea Sklodowska gets kicked out of her laboratory for being ... well ... a bit too headstrong for the times. Soon she meets an equally headstrong and also brilliant scientist named Pierre Curie (Sam Riley). Pierre recognizes the potential if they combine forces, while Marie initially demands her independence, having never found another scientist worthy of the efforts required for collaboration.The initial flirtations between brainy scientists is as clumsy and awkward as one might expect. In general, the film struggles with how to best address Curie's personal life with her professional life and the challenges she faced as a brilliant woman in an era when male scientists didn't much appreciate a woman scientist telling them they have ""misunderstood the atom"", as she and her husband announce the discovery of not one, but two new elements: radium and polonium. Romance and science and equality are a lot for one film to tackle, and this one flounders a bit.As the film and science progress, director Satrapi intersperses flash-forward vignettes to show how Curie's discovery of radioactivity is used in the future for both good and not so good. These dropped-in segments include cancer treatment for a little boy in 1957, the Enola Gay bombing Hiroshima in 1945, the Atomic Bomb test in 1961 Nevada, and of course, the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. The segments aren't always a smooth transition from Curie's story, but they make the point of how scientists don't always have control over how their discoveries are applied. There is even a scene where Pierre shows Marie some comical uses entrepreneurs found of trying to capitalize on their discovery, and how their work might factor in to everyday life.As a biography or profile of Marie Curie's life and accomplishments, the film hits the high notes, though we do wish it dug a bit deeper. The gender prejudices of the times are somewhat underplayed, and even Marie herself claims lack of funds and the fact that she wasn't a natural born Parisian held her back more than the roadblocks she faced as a female scientist. It would seem reasonable that those issues were likely tied together and should not be separated. She lashes out at Pierre regarding the Nobel committee initially keeping her name off the submission, but of course this anger is misplaced, as Pierre demanded she be included.The historical aspect of her winning two Nobel Prizes is not treated as the astonishing accomplishment it is, but time is spent on a personal scandal that occurred after Pierre's death. We do see Marie sleeping with a sample of her radioactive uranium, and watch her slow physical deterioration, including an incessant cough and damaged skin. Late in the film, Anya Taylor-Joy plays her daughter Irene, and we see the two of them head onto the battlefield to provide mobile x-ray devices for injured soldiers. The Curie family tree is filled with renowned scientists (Irene and her husband Frederick jointly won the Nobel Prize in 1935 for artificial radioactivity), and some of these discoveries literally changed the world - including cancer treatments. Perhaps it's unrealistic to expect any movie to capture the historical importance of Marie Curie, but we are somehow left feeling she deserved better."
Radioactive,13-Jun-20,"This movie is a pale and shallow effort to represent an extraordinary person with a remarkable life. Marie Curie is an absolute icon one of the most important scientists that ever existed and for sure the most important female scientist. Madamme Curie had a life full of challenges and she fought bravely to overcome barriers in the name of science. Her passion, her brilliance and her character changed the world in more than one way. She opened the way for women in science. She was the first female professor in the University of Paris. She was a poor immigrant, who had to work her way to the top. She was open about love, she was brave and humble and honest. She donated most of her Nobel money.
Did we get that in the movie? Maybe 1% of it. The vision of the director about one of the greatest minds of all time is ""Sheldon Cooper in a dress"". There was some effort to suggest how her discoveries changed the world, but it did not succeed to present the scope and the greatest importance of her work.This is not a bad movie, actually it is perfectly watchable. Actors are great and the love story between Marie and Pier is adorable. But given the fact that they had such an amazing life, I think the movie is a missed chance.Still better love story than Twilight though"
Radioactive,26-Jul-20,"Deserve a A+. I'm not cool like all the dudes who gave it a 2 or 3 but I do enjoy a well made movie that educates me, which is exactly what Radioactive did. Thank you Prime. Keep up the good work. You are giving all the cool people something to turn up their noses at and entertaining Neanderthals like me at the same time. This is something to be proud of."
Radioactive,22-Jul-20,"For anyone who might not know, the 2018 movie Entebbe is supposed to be about Israeli special forces rescuing the passengers of a hijacked airliner. The actual raid, the supposed topic of the movie, is only depicted for about 5 total minutes in the film. Even worse, scenes of the raid are interspersed with some scenes of a completely unrelated musical-art stage production. What the ....? Radioactive has the same pointless artsy angle. Instead of simply depicting Curie's tumultuous life, the film mixes in scenes of a completely unrelated dancer on a stage and other pointless bits.
Radioactive is a postmodern biopic that doesn't focus on telling the story of its subject's life, like a comedy special with no jokes."
Radioactive,02-May-20,"This film is of the life of Maria Sklodowska or as we better know her Marie Curie. Maria was a Polish scientist who had come to Paris in 1891 to continue with her studies.
The film starts at the end, now i know that sounds like a weird place to begin, but as you will see one of the first scenes are of Marie Curie (Played by Rosamund Pike) collapsing in her laboratory in 1934. As the scene progresses, Marie is seen being taken on a hospital trolley down a corridor, this is where she begins her flashback to how her wondrous life had played out. At this point i will say that you will come to realise that Marie, is scared/afraid of hospitals, of which you will see why. So we are back in 1893 in Paris, Marie (A name she took to be more ""French"" and be accepted) literally bumps into Pierre Curie (played by Sam Riley). Marie in her seemingly abrupt manner dismisses Pierre's interest in her work and promptly continues on her way to see Professor Lippmann (played by Simon Russell Beale). Professor Lippmann has a laboratory that Marie is using part of for her studies, but this meeting was to bring the end to this arrangement.
As the only woman among a group of 23 scientists in the department, Marie now faces the challenge of finding a new work space. As she hasn't the funds to set up her own, she has to see if anyone will give her the space and a chance. She is turned down by many, she believes that this is because she is Polish or a woman, or both. Then her break comes when she bumps into Pierre once again, this time not so literally. As Pierre has also seemingly been overlooked by the establishment, he offers Marie a space in his Laboratory. He is very aware of her work and has read her papers.
The story that we then know of Marie's great work is then portrayed in a very well produced drama, with the added bit of romance and tragedy."
Radioactive,30-Apr-20,"How can such an amazing and captivating subject like the live o Cutie can be made in such a boring movie?
You never nothing for the loveless characters in a bland script."
Radioactive,24-Jul-20,"Hohum till
Nobel prize speech and something about radioactivity falling into ""criminal
hands"". ...next scene the EnolaGay dropping a bomb on Hiroshima (ending WWII and saving a million lives). sneaky inaccurate misrepresentation of a complex bit of history"
Radioactive,24-Jul-20,Mostly a soap! So much has no historical validation and so out of sync with the values of the time and unlkel
Radioactive,05-May-20,"The film portrays Marie as the lead in the radium and studies on radioactivity. It commits the same sexism it wants to portray in men. It really diminishes the teamwork. Pierre Curie fought for his wife to be recognized for her equal contribution.
Acting is brilliant"
Radioactive,26-Jul-20,Very interesting. Some artistic license with presenting personal thoughts but a great overview of Marie Curie and her husband's work.
Radioactive,24-Jul-20,Great summary Of Marie Curie's life and achievement
Radioactive,17-Jul-20,"IN A NUTSHELL:
Directed by Marjane Satrapi, this drama features the true story of Nobel prize-winning Marie Sklodowska Curie (1867 - 1934). In addition to her incredible contributions to physics and chemistry, she's the only one in history to win 2 Novel prizes. The movie is based on the graphic novel Radioactive: Marie & Pierre Curie: A Tale of Love and Fallout by Lauren Redniss with the screenplay written by Jack Thorne.It was supposed to debut on International Women's Day but, like everything else this worldwide pandemic has touched, the release was postponed until now on Amazon Prime this week.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
There is a split second when you see two make people run and jump into a lake. Yes, you see skin and other things. That surprised me for a PG-13 movie. Why? It wasn't needed to move the story forward.
You see a married couple tossing around in bed briefly with some skin showing.
An unmarried couple is seen in bed, but you don't see any ""action.""
Infidelity and talk of ""intimate"" relationsTHEMES:
""The things that make us weak are the things that make us strong."" - Marie Curie
Persistence, determination
Equal rights for women
The quest for knowledge
Choice and consequence
Humanity
Love. Love of science and romantic love.
Humility in the face of innovation and invention
Whether mankind is ready for the benefits of nature or whether it will do harm
The double standard for men and womenTHINGS I LIKED:
I love Rosamund Pike in everything she does. I love that she's fascinated with the element radium that ""doesn't behave as it should"", just like her. You'll learn so many things about her and her story needs to be told. While Marie Curie's inventions brought humanity life-saving applications, I thought it was interesting that the film also pointed out the negative consequences.
Sam Riley plays Pierre Curie
If you ever watched The Big Bang Theory: The Complete Series (Limited Edition Blu-ray + Digital), you might have already learned a thing or two about some of these scientific elements.
The movie starts out showing off its agifying magic on Rosamund Pike by displaying an old, dying Marie Curie who reflects back on her life.
It's helpful to have a character who doesn't understand science so that Marie and Pierre can teach her and us at the same time.
My university students have been writing essays this week about which counts more: hard work or talent. I think this movie answers the debate. While brilliant, Marie Curie still had to work extremely hard to achieve her goals.
There is an interesting scene where Pierre and Marie argue about whether or not religion can be considered. Pierre points out that you can't see reactivity, yet it's real. Marie dismisses the idea, which is odd since scientists should be open to all possibilities in the search of truth.
There are some scenes that show future events and consequences of her discoveries. In most cases, they are powerful, albeit forced. She worried that her work would hurt people, but someone told her that it was her job to bring light to the world and to not worry about the ripples.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
The filming itself feels a bit clumsy.
The director tries to get creative with an artsy-fartsy dream sequence, but it doesn't quite work.
I have no idea what Marie Curie was like in real life, but it always annoys me when movies portray brilliant people as stubborn and rude.
I wish more time had spent on the good things that Marie Curie's discoveries accomplished, like the X-ray machine and cancer treatments, rather than on just the deadly bombs that would destroy life.
Some of the music was just odd and distracting.
All of the characters seem to age except Professor Lippmann (Simon Russell Beale).
The color palette is very grey in the 1800s, which is appropriate, but it felt like things should have lightened up in the 1900s.

Radioactive,01-May-20,Agreed this movie could have been much better. But by no means it is below per. Kudos to the production house for making this movie in spite of knowing that the target audience will be limited to those having science background. Full marks for a great effort towards bringing the life of a scientist onscreen. Highly recommended watch.
Radioactive,27-Jul-20,"Radioactive is a solid movie with some interesting screenplay decisions and directing. Overall it's effective at getting MME Curie's motivations, ambitions, and accomplisments across. Thorne and Satrapi provided an interesting take with mixing modern applications related to radioactive decay and uses both for good and war.I thought Rosamund's performance was excellent and Riley's as Pierre was also good.As a bonus, teachers have access to a guide that goes into her work and chemistry more on the movie page seperate from the movie."
Radioactive,29-Jul-20,"I really thought that this movie would actually focus on the scientific achievements & how they came about. But that wasn't the case. While it was good to know the Curies' as people and how brilliant, dedicated and in love they were I feel the movie missed its mark on script front.This almost felt as if the key moments (that are easily viewable online) in their lives were simply stitched together & the end too seemed quite abrupt.Still on the whole a decent and a feel good movie that had so much more potential"
Radioactive,28-Jul-20,"Radioactive (4 out of 5 stars).Radioactive is a good biographical drama film about Marie Curie (Rosamund Pike) and Pierre (Sam Riley) teaming together to coming out with a breakthrough on a new element. Creating radioactivity. The breakthrough takes science into a whole new direction with medical technology. Or weaponry.The plot is good. I also liked how the movie shows Marie Curie trying to do things on her own. Being one of the first woman in science and trying to do things her own way. Which Pierre understood her way of thinking. I also liked how the movie refers to a flash foward when Pierre or Marie giving a lecture about there research while flash fowarding to an event like WWII Hiroshima bombing or Nevadas nuclear bomb testing site. And than the Chernobyl incident. That while creating something helpful in the medical field can also have a downfall with being used as a weapon.Rosamund Pike and Sam Riley did great with there characters. Anya Taylor Joy also did a good job playing there young adult daughter.The music score is good. Its a relaxing electronical kind of feel. The direction is a little fast moving with its pace. Going from brief moments of Marie and Pierre love life. To discovering an element. To the characters suffering from an illness.I did feel like the films final moments with Maries illness coming to her and her moments of flashing with what her breakthrough has become. Did feel a little faulty with the script and weak third act. Otherwise, it is a good biographical film that is worth checking out about the events of Marie Curie."
Radioactive,07-May-20,"The script was trash, but i thought the surreal effects were what kept it from being more boring than it otherwise could have been.
it's not a great film, but i can always appreciate strange creative choices.... i think it would have been better if it had been more surreal throughout... maybe like a time travelling dream."
Most Wanted,14-Jul-20,"""Target Number One"" is a well directed, well acted and compelling Canadian film that everyone should see.
.
In this drama based on a true story, a Canadian journalist investigates the circumstances surrounding the suspicious arrest of a heroin addict imprisoned in a Thai jail.
.
Well crafted and unafraid of telling the true story; ""Target Number One"" dives deep into a frustratingly un-Canadian crime story and really delivers. This is the first Canadian film to be released since Covid-19 hit and it truly is a really good film to kick it off. Josh Hartnett gives probably the performance of his career and Antoine Olivier Pilon is exceptional. The film is never boring nor does it lag, it's the perfect length and pace and I really enjoyed it.
."
Most Wanted,24-Jul-20,May not have the grip of a massive Hollywood thriller but it isn't far off. Engaging and well worth a watch. A solid 8 out 10.
Most Wanted,27-Jul-20,"I remember reading the actual news from this incident back when I was in my late teens, early twenties. Victor Malarek did an incredibly good job at showing how incompetent Canadian officials who couldn't cause a significant dent in the drug trade coming from Asia into north america decided to use a straw man to create a fictitious incident in order to improve their image.
The incident in itself and how it was covered back then by journalist Malarek was plain riveting. Unfortunately, the movie that was made about it is clearly not a top quality product and misuses the talent of great actors. Still worth watching just to learn about what happened."
Most Wanted,26-Jul-20,"This film was completely overcooked and half baked at the same time. While the lead actor who played Daniel Legey was solid and Jim gaffigan's character was enjoyable on screen, the rest of the supporting cast were a drain... Especially all of the police officer roles. Halfway through the film, we knew it was a dud but somehow felt committed - yet we were simply watching actors play out their roles instead of being immersed in the story itself... Hoping it would miraculously turn around in the third act: spoiler alert, it doesn't. There's absolutely no reason this story required 135 minutes to tell and certainly does not deserve two plus hours of anyone's time."
Most Wanted,30-Jul-20,"Well worth a watch! A credible account that was well depicted.I can't speak for 80's Canada but it got 80's Thailand spot on. DEA and British customs were very active in Thailand at that time. They pressured the Thai police which vigorously targeted foreigners, escalating the severity of relatively minor drug offences, and if they didn't have the funds to buy their way out of trouble, in they went. To divert attention from the real ( protected) players, to satisfy visable Thai compliance, to deter chancers and newcomers but predominantly to bolster publicity for Reagan and Bush's, well funded and highly lucrative ""just say no! "" ""war on drugs.""There from 84 to 92. The film brought back a lot of memories, not least those shackles that Justin Jackson mentions in his review. I'd forgotten the peeling blue/green paint that was everywhere. The prison population seemed authentic apart from a lack locked up foreigners (among other nationalities lots of Nigerian mules were convicted around that time) the film depicts the situation and era very well."
Most Wanted,25-Jul-20,"Amazing that all the positive reviews were msde either1 day before release or a day after. Within 8 mins I gave up as the music was so loud it completely blocked out what the actos were saying.
Movies usually never work out well when the writer also directs them. This was the case for this one"
Most Wanted,26-Jul-20,The music is too loud and I got motion sickness with the shacking of the camera
Most Wanted,27-Jul-20,"Do not watch this movie. I'd say this review contains spoilers, but considering I still don't know what the movie was about after watching it, I'll say there are no spoilers.
I rarely review bad movies because its just too easy to rag on them sometimes. This is some low hanging fruit to criticize. An hour into the movie, my wife looked to me and asked me what this movie was about and I couldn't answer her. I finished the movie and I still can't answer the question.
Josh Hartnett (Hollywood just won't give up on this guy for some reason) doesn't seem interested in this role. He's swollen (from booze?) and even though this movie takes place in Montreal at times (where I'm from) it just wasn't enough to recommend."
Most Wanted,25-Jul-20,"Its supposedly made over a true story , where names and plot are changed to such a degree that it feels like fiction. the story goes back and forth between canada and thailand, where everybody, even the copper seems to be snorting their own deals undercover. the little but noteworthy important timeline info that are usually used to tell the viewer where and when things happen are totally missed out. that is a cathastropic failiure even in quasi biographical movies.the journalist thing was the only part of the show i could hardly find the true purpose of, for the rest its just a tuktuk thai french froglike canadian english heroin blur, made on a undynamic and low budget. the actors does not impress much on a plot and story directed in a way i cant comply withthe grumpy old man gives no more than a max of 5 for this show, have seen a few worse and a whole lot of far better flicks than this. just a weak recommend"
Most Wanted,24-Jul-20,"The hard-headed reporter who doesn't play by the rules is a stock character of films that invariably do. So it proves, again, in ""Most Wanted,"" a fact-based Canadian procedural of police skulduggery and journalistic derring-do that does its own job with proficient integrity, but as much inventiveness as you'd guess from that all-purpose placeholder of a title. Writer-director Daniel Roby has fictionalized the grim story of Alain Olivier, a small-time drug dealer tricked in 1989 by Canuck police into traveling to Thailand to orchestrate a major heroin score, landing him several years in a local prison. Victor Malarek, the real-life journo who uncovered the agents' corruption, retains his identity in Roby's telling, though as played with furrowed brow and gruff virtue by Josh Hartnett, he's a movie hero through and through.What sparks of strangeness and intrigue ""Most Wanted"" has emerge principally from the presence of Antoine-Olivier Pilon - the electric star of Xavier Dolan's ""Mommy"" in 2014 - as Olivier, here renamed Daniel Léger for purposes of creative leeway. His gangly body language and penetrating, off-kilter stare suggest a real, bewildered inner rage, not defined simply by the tabloid-ready circumstances of his victimhood. You needn't be familiar with the true story to anticipate his arc here, but Pilon makes for volatile watching all the same. When the script shifts to matters of newsroom infighting and shoe-leather reporting, Hartnett takes the lead with his usual likeable diligence, but it's hard not to feel we've drifted from the film's live wire.It's a good 45 minutes before Pilon's and Hartnett's halves of the film intersect, exposing a staggered non-linear timeline that, while deftly engineered, doesn't yield quite the dramatic payoff you might expect. Before then, ""Most Wanted"" introduces its leads in leisurely fashion. Malarek is established as a star print and TV newsman whose earnest commitment to truth-seeking hasn't made him many friends in high places, and a loving but inattentive husband to his wife Anna (Amanda Crew, thanklessly cast). He's lightly admonished for missing the birth of their first child to chase a scoop; beyond that, Roby's screenplay isn't much concerned with Malarek's home life either.Léger is presented to us with more human creases and question marks. An itinerant manual laborer with a drug habit and very bad taste in companions, he has a chequered personal history that is revealed only in patches - the blank spaces turn out to be crucial, particularly when the police identify him as an ideal patsy for an entrapment operation. Falling in with brutish low-level criminal Picker (Jim Gaffigan, playing seamily and effectively against type) is a dead end that pretty much anybody but the dim, desperate Léger could see coming: Soon enough, he's sent to Thailand to do a supposedly routine deal. Cue reversal, betrayal and a stint in the infamous Bang Kwang prison - portrayed here in suitably sobering fashion, though with slightly less baroque hellishness than in 2017's ""A Prayer Before Dawn,"" another true-life tale of a hapless westerner drawn into its violent confines.As Malarek pursues the truth of what exactly went down - to the grave consternation of his editor (J.C. Mackenzie), who'd rather he just left the whole thing alone - viewers might arrive at it slightly ahead of him. At over two hours, ""Most Wanted"" could stand to pick up the pace of its own investigation: Malarek's office squabbles and marital strains, in particular, are diversions that consume considerable screen time without accumulating much emotional weight. Whenever it's on Thai soil, the film moves with tightened urgency and vigor: Ronald Plante's camerawork, crisp and handsome throughout, gains in humid restlessness as it travels from the serene, misted vistas of British Columbia.Along with Pilon's striking performance, the film's sturdy, subdued craftsmanship keeps it from movie-of-the-week territory, even as Roby's script ticks overly familiar boxes. Eloi Painchaud's score contributes subtle menace, while Yvann Thibaudeau's editing zips and darts and cross-cuts in ways that enliven passages of procedural cliché. Still, it's hard not to feel that ""Most Wanted"" has hedged its bets between the perspectives of two characters, when we'd rather see Olivier/Léger's story through his own naive eyes. What's that they say about journalists becoming the story?"
Most Wanted,29-Jul-20,During the film the camera was shaking. Music was very loud. Acting is poor even though the plot is interesting except Josh Hartnett. Very disappointing!
Most Wanted,26-Jul-20,"Very good and entertaining movie! (sure, it could be 20 or 30 minutes shorter) but it don't take away the outstanding acting delivered by Josh Hartnett and the rest of the cast, to be fear.
Great production. Nothing fancy, but put you in the 80's mood within no problem!
It deserve the 8 I gave or more!!"
Most Wanted,12-Jul-20,"This movie is like new version of ""I Tonya"" in I Tonya the movie showed the whole world as evil so they present the real time villain as if she is a good person or a victim..in this movie a convicted drug dealer is hero, so his family, friend, Canadian police, Thailand police and literally everyone around this dude is evil..is that makes sense?if yes, you gonna love this movie"
Most Wanted,25-Jul-20,"So pleased to see a well written, well filmed, well acted story, and set in Canada no less. The thing with Canada is that it has such a clean image on the world stage, you'd never think they'd throw their own under the bus. So, in that sense too, the story was original. It was edited very well, and kept the story line interesting. Such a pleasure to see the talented Hartnett do his thing too. Very good actor for this film based on a true story. Refreshingly great."
Most Wanted,27-Jul-20,Worth a watch - got the Bombad stuff 100% right - almost wish i hadnt watched it - the clothes the conditions - the chains we wore and that constant tinkle in the back ground of chains As for the story - met so many guys in Bombad and Klong prem that got set up that way - I actually worked with a guy in the E thing that we found out later was also feeding the DEA set up busts - Bradley was his name - someone gave him a hotshot in a patpong cafe - guessing he got susseed out - but yes this kind of BS was still going on Mid 90s and am guessing it still is
Most Wanted,30-Jul-20,"First of all, Great performance !! Josh Harnett was delivered a really good performance. So do the rest of the actor.i loved the story, its gonna pump you chess up. i'm going to say that not everybody gonna like this story, but for me its pretty good. They way they executed all of it was brilliant. you can tell that this not that movie with a 'budget'. But the fact that they still doing a good job was a PLUS.Great detail for me for making that 80' vibes"
Most Wanted,26-Jul-20,"Great to see Josh Hartnett back - well made Canadian film, fine acting and good base on true events story"
Most Wanted,28-Jul-20,"Good story, lil' under mediocre x-cution(It also waaaay 2 american then it should be, especially Ukrainian reporter who got what he wanted 2 b, it's also '89 - this should be more raw then it is but whatever, i'm already surprised that some censorship was given some slack)Always-on-Canadian-police-side twitter nerds r triggered now XD"
Little Women,30-Dec-19,"Some comments lament the movie has changed from the book (especially the ending). I heard a Greta Gerwig interview today where she explained she studied Louisa May Alcott and found out Alcott, in actuality, was pressured by her publishers, to marry Jo at the end of the book. Gerwig wanted to honor Alcott by ending it the way it really was meant to be. This knowledge made the movie so much better for me."
Little Women,30-Jan-20,"This review is coming from someone who doesn't know the book and never seen any other Little Women movie. I completely fell in love with the story, it's simplicity, emotional twists and drama. The performances are fantastic and talk about a cast, probably one of the best in 2019. Since Meryl Streep to Emma Watson, Timothée Chalamet, Florence Pugh, Laura Dern, Saoirse Ronan and even Chris Cooper looks good on this movie. The future of Hollywood is very well preserved with all this talent, so young and already so well established in the industry (Eliza too!). Loved all the performances, specially Saiorse who gives such a brilliant performance it goes beyong supporting actress. The costume design are always so beautiful and the cinematography gorgeous. Saying that Gerwig was overlooked is an understatement as everything she did was nominated except herself. Hope it does well in the Oscars but if not, it remains one of my favorite movies of 2019!"
Little Women,18-Jan-20,"This film is simply spectacular! The acting is superb by everone in the cast, the attention to detail here is just breathtaking. I was wondering during the film that how much time and effort were into making this movie.I was a bit annoyed by the non-linearity of the script and thought it was overdone but besides that I enjoyed this film a lot. Go see this."
Little Women,02-Mar-20,It was going back and forth too much. A little more chronology would have been better in my opinion.
Little Women,08-Mar-20,"If you want to see Little Women watch the 1994 version. It was perfectly cast and had a coherent plot line. This movie is poorly cast in a lot of roles. The back and forth timeline is confusing. You gain zero empathy for the characters. Beth's death is a blip, barely any emotion. I didn't shed a tear. Chalamet is unbelievable as Teddy. He looks like he's perpetually 16. Laura Dern is a terrible choice for Marmee. There was no established love story between Jo and Friedrich so when they get together it's just silly. The 94 version is not old enough to be unappealing to younger audiences and was so well done and cast and acted that this monstrosity was a was of time and energy. The fact that it got nominated for Best Picture is someone's idea of a joke. If you liked this movie try the 94 version and tell me I'm wrong."
Little Women,15-Jan-20,"So the writer/director was snubbed by the Oscars. And the industry wonders why the audience is no longer there. It's because people won't pay your high prices for the crap you are producing. Few of the really good films were even nominated for an Oscar. So keep producing films that only others in Hollywood will go to see, and you will go broke.
Now for this film. Like another reviewer I have never read the book or seen previous movies. But I really enjoyed this movie. My only complaint is that because of the constant change of time (like in all other movies that use that method of transition) the story is hard to follow.
I must say the actress playing the lead and Laura Dern are superb. I have long been in love with Laura Dern and now even more so. I also am in love with Emma Watson but was very disappointed with her performance. I'm so glad I saw her in ""Beauty and the Beast""."
Little Women,08-Jan-20,"Greta Gerwig, in my estimation, is one of the most brilliant female scriptwriters/film directors currently making movies. Her version on Alcott's classic novel is spellbinding. She adroitly juxtapositions a several years span between the year composing and publication of her 1868 book and the Civil War years at home when the novel's events took place. I am also appreciative of Yorick Le Saux's plush cinematography. What a duo Gerwig and the French photographer made to produce one of the most gorgeous period pieces in many of a moon.Two minor complaints: The casting of Timothee Chalet, the love interest of two of the sisters. He's portrayed as a young wastrel whose apathy somehow attracts the two into wanting to marry. Another is that Alcott had writing success writing under the nom de plume A.M. Bernard before composing Little Women, a detail totally ignored.Otherwise, an outstanding film that surprised even this guy who went on his wife's insistence."
Little Women,08-Jan-20,"Really well done, didn't expect before going to theatre but the director has been able to mix a great performance from all the actors with a well-done screenplay. Not the normal Little Woman, a personal version of Greta Gerwig."
Little Women,08-Jan-20,"Writer/director Greta Gerwig tries her hand at Alcott's timeless, semi-autobiographical coming-of-age story by spotlighting two different time periods in the lives of the indefatigable March sisters, with first-rate casting featuring Ronan as the free-spirited, aspiring storyteller Jo, Watson as the fashionable, domestic Meg, Pugh as the economical, attention-seeking Amy, Scanlen as the quiet, musical Beth, and their journey from childhood to young adulthood as they pursue their individual hopes and dreams during the 1860s. Even though it isn't a direct page to screen adaptation, and the overlapping of timelines can be taxing at times, Gerwig is able to stage many powerful scenes that explore the all-important themes of sexism, loneliness, friendship, love, and unbreakable familial bonds thanks to four fabulous leading ladies, and quality work from Chalamet, Cooper, and Streep who are invaluable in key supporting roles. ***"
Little Women,01-Jan-20,"""Little Women"" is the classic story of the four March sisters growing and learning about the world together in the northeastern United States during the 19th century. We have Jo (Saoirse Ronan) - the strong-willed writer, Meg (Emma Watson) - the softer, more traditional sister, Beth (Eliza Scanlen) - the quiet one, and Amy (Florence Pugh) - the spirited and most immature. Marmie, the mother, (Laura Dern) oversees the girls while the father is at war.They're a charming bunch, different in their own way. The headstrong Jo believes she has this whole life thing figured out, and she often urges her sisters to follow her suggestions, which are an ounce of urgency away from becoming outright demands. Despite Jo's efforts, each girl possesses the gusto to follow her own path, and ultimately, they live the lives they want to lead as little women.Greta Gerwig delivers a wonderful adaptation of the classic novel, perhaps the best to date. Give her plenty of credit for the work, just make sure to also credit the actors. They're all brilliant. The girls give outstanding performances, as does Timothee Chalamet as Theodore Laurence, the boy next door to the girls. Everyone calls him Laurie, everyone except Jo.Jo and Teddy, as she calls him, share an instant and lifelong connection. They love each other immediately and always. It's clear as day to everyone. The only person who doesn't seem to see it is Jo. Focusing on her writing and drive to show the world that women are worth more than their appearance, Jo has no interest in marriage or love. But this is a story, so the two will have their chance.Here comes the SPOILER.I'm sorry to question the writer of such a wonderful story, but with the clear love between Teddy and Jo, why in the world do they not end up together? The movie's version of the story attempts to explain it but fails miserably. In every scene Teddy and Jo share, the two characters display magnetic chemistry - the rare kind. Nothing can keep them apart. Except for an unfathomable choice by the author of the novel. Jo turns down Teddy, who turns to Amy for her hand in marriage. She says yes. This works well for Amy because she had always loved Laurie, as she calls him. But Jo is later so upset and desperately lonely that she immediately agrees to date a professor she met while teaching young writing students. The two get along fine. Just fine. The two get together after he shows up at the March home one day, spends a bit of time with the family, then leaves. As soon as he walks out the door, the rest of the family shouts at Jo that she loves him and should chase him. What? It's laughably absurd, as there is zero indication that Jo actually loves him. I hate to say this because I liked the movie very much, but this misstep in the story must be called out. Jo and Teddy should be together. Yes it's predictable, but it's the correct ending.END of SPOILERGerwig makes a beautiful film, sagely including enough light moments to complement the heavy theme material that makes up more of the movie than younger viewers might notice. Gerwig establishes a fitting tone, lighting and style, all elevating the overall film. With all that she does well, she also makes one curious decision, which is to sequence the film completely out of chronological order. It never totally works, more often taking away from the story than improving it. The choice is one of the couple tiny blemishes preventing the film from being flawless.For anyone and everyone, ""Little Women"" is worth seeing. See it with others and talk about it afterwards. It'll be well worth your time."
Little Women,23-Jan-20,"Finally saw LITTLE WOMEN 2019. Didn't expected much cause I really liked 94 version by Gillian Armstrong with Winona Ryder , Gabriel Byrne , Trini Alvarado , Christian Bale and Susan Sarandon.
Well, the casting was something that I cannot judge which one is better. Both are so so great. But Christian Bale 94, I liked better than Timothée Chalamet 2019 (Although he was good but didn't overcome THE Christian).Two things really grabbed me.1. The camera and light. The camera is keep moving even for the steady shots. They released the tripod and moved a little to adjust each actors even a small movement they make.
They also use sunlight so beautifully like Pride and Prejudice.
Aldo a couple of slow motions and mintage sequences are beautiful too.2. The music. It is not like here I am listen like Hans Zimmer or Max Richter or even Cliff Martinez who would say even if the movie suck I am still here. Think that at least you've watched a great Music Video cause of my music.
In this movie the music is there clearly and when it comes to really important moments, It really boost up the heart of audience. But it's more like supporting way. I felt it from the very beginning. Ok wow this guy knows OST!! Alexandre is more of a classic composer who made OST like The Danish Girl, The Tree of life, Julie & Julia and Philomena.I cannot say this movie will win (was nominated for 6 Academy) a lot of awards from all around the world but it has beautiful beautiful acting ensenble and light, camera and music wise. Work of art.Also the acting sometimes made my heart beat.
Even the makeup is so great. Of course the director is also an actress so she knows how to deal with these stuff, right?Last. The time. It goes back and forth from the past to present a couple of times but it was not confusing or breaking any concentration cause it was so nicely connected by editing and bridge music. (The cast y-oung and old -was the same too which didn't matter as well.)
Something that was different with the 94 version.It is an inspiring movie after all and I won't rest tonight to finish my humble feature writing for my next project."
Little Women,24-Jan-20,"And I don't say this often (if ever). It seemed to offer answers towards everything I feel as a twenty one year old woman. It hit me on a personal level like no other movie has ever done.Ronan's portrayal of Jo March makes us relate to the character the way one could only ever relate to characters in books where you can use much of your imagination. We can easily understand why she might be the best actress of our generation.There was a lot of crying, but in the good way that leaves you feeling whole towards the end. This movie is an incredible adaption of the book that represents all the struggles us women stand for."
Little Women,16-Jan-20,"As one who has not read the book, I cannot speak to the accuracy of this film, but I will attest to its authenticity. There is a warmth burning at its heart and it brings great light to its characters as well as awful shadow. I call this film generous because it gives the viewer so much. So much intelligence, so much kindness, so much sadness: so much to love and wonder. And it does all of it without being a ""romantic"" movie. It it is aware of the realities of women during this time period and treats marital situations with honesty, but also with grace. There is romance, but it is merely a part for these characters which I think is Gerwig's biggest accomplishment; to draw these women as more without the need to make them gritty, troubled, or with hubris. This film is a portrait of their lives painted with generosity without becoming poor. The cinematography is gorgeous, the casting is supreme, the writing memorable and the performance unforgettable. Saoirse Ronan and Timothée Chalamet are delightful on screen together and there is a general air of touching tenderness and welcoming mind in all the characters down to the extras. I tip my hat to this film and say bravo, Gerwig and company, bravo, to you and everyone who worked on it."
Little Women,16-Jan-20,I've read the book a few dozen times. I loved the 2nd version most UNTIL now. This was excellent. The new flow worked well while keeping to the true story. Just loved it.
Little Women,14-Jan-20,"Did the world need or ask for another adaptation of Louisa May Alcott's famed novel Little Women? The answer is probably no but after having sat through Greta Gerwig's lovingly shot and beautifully staged version of the beloved story of the March sisters, you'd be hard pressed too find many viewers that weren't glad this new take on the classic story came to life.Announcing herself as a filmmaking force with her directional debut Lady Bird, Gerwig proves here to be the real deal in a very big way, as she takes the reigns behind the camera and takes charged of screenwriting duties as she instills her own flavor and verve into Alcott's family drama.Whilst set in the Civil War era of the United States, Gerwig manages to bring modern day sensibilities and flair to the March's tale, without ever losing sight of the core heart and soul of the narrative that has managed to maintain a place in popular culture for these many years since it's initial release in print form.Little Women is one of those features that feels accomplished and thought through wherever you look from Yorick Le Saux's photogenic cinematography, Jacqueline Durran's sumptuous costume design, through to a typically strong Alexandre Desplat score, as the film showcases Gerwig growing before our eyes as a director in what's a major step up production wise from the small-scale and more independently structured Lady Bird.As with her breakout film, Gerwig has managed to assemble a fantastic and on song cast to bring her vision to screen with every performer bringing their A-game's to proceedings here, as returning Gerwig actors Saoirse Ronan and Timothee Chalamet as the determined and unflappable Jo March and the devilishly charismatic Theodore Laurence respectively shine brightest in a loaded ensemble.With Lady Bird and this higher profile effort under her belt, it's clear that Gerwig is an actors director, as she also oversees the further establishment of 2019 breakout star Florence Pugh, who delivers an awards worthy turn as the more artistic and whimsical March sister Amy.Thanks to the film's overwhelmingly strong performances and technical strengths, the fact that Little Women's now more formulaic and familiar plot movements and processions never threaten to detour from the fact this heartfelt and soulful effort is a thoroughly enjoyable and likable affair, that manages to say some important things about equality and female empowerment without ever feeling preachy or overbearing.A strong vision from a female filmmaker of substantial and timely power.Final Say -A deservingly praised incarnation of a much adapted tale, Little Women is a fabulously watchable version of a literary classic that further enhances Gerwig and her actresses standings in the cinematic landscape.4 1/2 burnt novels out of 5"
Little Women,20-Jan-20,"In Writer and Director Greta Gerwig's adaptation of Louisa May Alcott's ""Little Women"", Jo March, Alcott's Hero, played by Saoirse Ronan, regrets her angry unforgiving nature over her younger sister Amy, played by Florence Pugh, who could have died, because of her irresponsibility. Wise Mother Marmee, played by Laura Dern, sits beside distraught Jo. She says that she knows what it's like to be ""angry nearly every day of my life"". She hopes that Jo does better. Jo confesses to her consuming writer's passion, and Amy's callous act when they were children.Marmee reminds, ""There are some natures too noble to curb, too lofty to bend."" Perhaps, following one's greater nature is more about what you're willing to give up. That too is the eloquent beauty of Greta's ""Little Women"". Greta reunites with Saoirse from ""Lady Bird"" in Alcott's rites of passage tale of unconditional love. Saoirse plays the young vulnerable idealist Jo, who wants to be taken legitimately as a writer. Still, she wants to be loved.Saoirse's Jo cops to her loneliness to compassionate Laura's Marmee. Mom asks Jo if she loves Laurie, played by charmingly aloof Timothee Chalamet. Jo says, ""I want to be loved."" Marmee says, ""That's not the same as loving."" No, it's not.Still, Jo has unconditional love. Returning home from New York to care for her ailing sister Beth, played by quietly strong Eliza Scahlen, she reads to Beth at the beach. Weakened Beth wants to hear more of Jo's own stories. She tells her, ""Keep writing... after I'm gone."" Jo's eyes well with tears. So did mine.""Little Women"" has great soulfulness and humanity. Life is both joy and loss on the journey of creating your own greater version. Life is about defining your calling, your purpose, and finding balance. Yes, we all want to be loved. Maybe part of being loved is forgiving others and ourselves, and giving love back, too. Rather, I believe that's what Greta Gerwig and Louisa May Alcott are trying to say.Set during the US Civil War, Director Greta brilliantly weaves childhood flashback into her very contemporary transformational narrative. The 1860's was not the time for women, which might be the social irony of Alcott's novel. Wealthy Aunt March, played with humorous gravitas by Meryl Streep, reminds Amy that a woman must either have money or marry a man with it.Laura's Marmee raises her 4 daughters Jo, Meg, Amy, and Beth, played by Saoirse, Emma Watson, Florence, and Eliza, all alone while her Husband, played by solid Bob Odenkirk, is away supporting the Civil War.The girls all have their individual passions. Jo, of course wants to be a writer. From the time they were young children, she wrote plays for her sisters to performs, albeit reluctantly at times. Meg's passion is acting. Amy wants to be a famous painter. Beth is quiet shy piano protégé.The March's live next door to the very rich Laurence's. Their longtime childhood friend is playboy Theodore 'Laurie'. Timothee embodies surprising charm and depth of emotion in Laurie. Laurie has been in love with Jo, since they were teens. Jo loves Laurie, yet not in the way he wished. That's the designed melodrama of ""Little Women"". What could have been the perfunctory plot device, Greta reinvents as the narrative of self-discovery and forgiveness. Greta's profound muse is Saoirse.Saoirse authentically captures the joy and the suffering in Jo's visage, in her being. She's wickedly funny negotiating her book with publisher Mr. Dashwood, played by cantankerous Tracy Letts, also from ""Lady Bird"". Her kindness comforts when she hugs Marmee following personal tragedy.Saoirse's nobility rises and never bends. That's the distinct heart and humanity of Greta Gerwig's ""Little Women"". Often times, creating the greater versions of ourselves is about letting go. It's about love and forgiveness, for others and for ourselves. That makes watching ""Little Women"" beautiful. Just saying."
Little Women,17-Dec-19,"The newest adaptation of Louisa May Alcott's classic novel, ""Little Women,"" was the best version I have ever seen. Directed by Greta Gerwig, the film stars Saoirse Ronan as Jo March, Emma Watson as Meg, Florence Pugh as Amy, Eliza Scanlen as Beth, and Laura Dern as Marmee. Timothée Chalamet stars as Laurie, Chris Cooper is Mr. Laurence, and Meryl Streep as Aunt March.The entire cast is stupendous. Ms. Ronan stands out in her tour de force performance as Jo, the independent writer, who refuses to marry, and is determined to make her own path. She unflinchingly remains true to herself, her family and her work as both a writer and a teacher.The main difference between this adaptation and its predecessors is the stream of consciousness approach as the story moves between the present day March family, and the stories of growing up together. Parallels between the challenges when they were children and the struggles of adulthood weave together to tell their story both now and then. Gerwig and her team does a masterful job of storytelling to balance it all in a cohesive manner that holds the audience's attention and intrigue, even if most viewers already know the original story.To enhance the superb storytelling, the film's cinematography and costume design, recreating 19th century New England, was a bright spot in this visually captivating film. I wouldn't be surprised if this film was among the select few chosen for nominations in both categories at this year's Oscars."
Little Women,15-Jan-20,"One of the most beautiful movies of the year. I haven't seen any of the other versions nor did I read the source novel but what I loved most about the film is the beautiful harmony that director Greta Gerwig brings on screen from the very first minute of the movie unit it lasts.
The acting is superb. You have Saoirse Ronan who commands every scene she is in and gives her Jo so much life and makes her also very unpredictable in emotions and reactions. Its really nice to see Ronan on the edge to become truly her generations Meryl Streep. Oh Streep herself was fine in this, giving us quirky Aunt March in a very enjoyable, almost self ironic performance. Loved her characters unintentional sarcasm. Emma Watson is the weakest link, but her character is also the most uninteresting one. However its still sad she didn't do anything to uplift that fact. Florence Pugh is wonderful and totally deserving of her Oscar nomination for her loud, wild and then very calm and sensitive performance. So many emotions in one performance. Just great.
Laura Dern is fine, lovely and giving a very warm performance. Chris Cooper is somehow wasted however it is always a good addition in any movie he is. Eliza Scanlan was great, already loved heir in ""Sharp Objects"" but she did something that Watson wasnt able. Bringing a rather blunt character truly to live. Last but certainly not least there was Timothée Chalamet who gives one of the most underrated performances of the year. How does he not get more mentions for this truly fantastic and fresh performance? And no I am not only talking about *his* scene I am talking about his entire appearance . So natural, so witty, so funny, so charming so tragic so wonderful. Did not expect him to live up to those little women but he did and deserves much more applause for it.
The screenplay was great. I sometimes got a bit confused with the time twists though. Great score by Alexandre Desplat and in the end one of the best films we got to see 2019."
Little Women,14-Jan-20,"The 7th film adaptation of Louisa May Alcott's classic novel of the same name is the only version that I've seen so far and frankly, I don't need to check out the ones that surfaced before anymore coz Greta Gerwig's Little Women is an instant classic that impresses on all fronts, and also establishes her as a creative force to be reckoned with.Written & directed by Gerwig in what's her solo sophomore effort, the film is crafted with so much love, passion, honesty, authenticity & heartfelt warmth that it has the viewers under its spell within minutes. Gerwig captures the joy, pain, tenderness & everlasting love between sisters with such effortless purity that it's just beautiful to watch.Coming off the critical & commercial success of Lady Bird, Gerwig proves that she is no one hit wonder, for Little Women is much better & far more mature work from her. The period details, costume design, low-light photography stand out with ease, while excellent editing makes sure there isn't a single wasted scene in the final print.Gerwig's script bestows each character with arcs that exhibit depth & richness, and then she directs the terrific cast of Saoirse Ronan, Florence Pugh, Emma Watson, Eliza Scanlen & others to help them bring their respective roles to life with finesse & vibrancy. Ronan's input is amazing, Pugh is just as good & the rest provide brilliant support but it's their chemistry with one another that clicks best.Overall, Little Women presents Greta Gerwig in stellar form, and is another quality addition to her filmography. Exquisitely highlighting the women's plight, prejudice & powerlessness in those days and to an extent even today, Little Women is a joyful celebration of sisterhood that's highly faithful to its source material and is winsome & whimsical in wonderful ways. One of the best all-round films of 2019."
Little Women,12-Jan-20,"Despite being a simple story about a simple family, Little Women became a surprise hit that shook me to my core. There are movies that are good because of their graphics, or cast, or music, but Little Women is fantastic because of its genuinely raw portrayal of how we react as humanity and changed the way I see the world and the relationships I make.I walked in thinking the film would be rather dull, a boring story about a poor family in the middle of Massachusetts doesn't sound all that interesting, but the way Greta Gerwig, the director (also known for other feminist-esque films like Lady Bird and 20th Century Women), shows how every word spoken and create a bond between two people that changes the way one lives for the rest of their lives.You also get so involved in the characters - every action they do is so interesting because, in a world where not much happens, every little thing matters. The reason I walked out of the film in awe is because of its rawness - the way most movies show relationships are not exactly how they work in real life. But Little Women said every thought about love that we never dare to say to others out loud, while also challenging what it meant to be a woman during the Civil War.It's not only the astounding acting that makes this movie top-notch - it's the production. Bringing in so many famous and fantastic actors - Saoirse Ronan, and Emma Watson, Laura Dern, Meryl Streep - to name a few, one would already be able to say the film would be successful.And the set design! The beautiful site it was filmed is already mind-blowing, but the immense attention to detail that makes every meal show so craving you'll be starving by the end of it. With nine nominations in the critic choice awards and a 95% score on Rotten Tomatoes, the movie definitely knocks it out of the park with critics.All in all, if you're a person who likes action and danger, this movie may not be your cup of tea, but I urge everyone who has emotions (which is everyone, I hope) to see it. It evokes the surreal feeling that we are not so much different than others while also maintaining the simplistic, happy-go-lucky feeling we all yearn to achieve in one way or another."
Little Women,28-Jan-20,"I would like to hang out with these characters. These ""little women"", if you will. They exhibited themselves with such boisterous youthful brashness that I often found myself laughing, if not gut-chuckling. What a wonderful family-unit; but no, more of a {italics}sister-unit{italics} than a family-unit. I loved the way they got on together and had a whale of a time. (Yet there were also some sad scenes that caused my eyes to self-lubricate.)My favorites were Amy (Pugh) and Jo (Ronan). Amy was rather forceful, fun-loving, raucous, yearning, excitable, whim-worthy, world-trodden, and multifaceted. And she was proud of her feet. Jo, for her part, was well-reasoned, impassioned, headstrong, determined, focused, social-sickened, expectation-allergic, hubby-shunning, void-gazing, and contemplative. And she was a non-breeder.The framing was excellent, some of the best I've ever seen. There were shots of swooning countrysides, stately mansions, comfy cottages, bustling theatre-facades, shivering staircases, glistening snow-scapes, and swirling sand-winds.Greta Gerwig did a great job! 💃💅👠👗🏡"
Little Women,26-Jan-20,"Beyond excellent photography, efficient editing and directing, this movie captures the rich depth of characters the original book brings to life.
Not only will I effusively recommend to family, I intend to watch repeatedly myself."
Little Women,26-Jan-20,Highly recommend and one of my favorite movies to date. Beautiful adaptation that brings the profound literary themes of the book to life. I felt moved in every single scene. Definitely deserves Oscar!
Little Women,12-Jan-20,"Tender, beautiful rhythm, well-kept characters and an atmosphere that holds up to the end. we all know the story, making a good movie was not easy at all. 7/10"
Little Women,25-Jan-20,"This was my favourite childhood read and I went to the cinema in full 'critic mode'. But I was absolutely blown away, enchanted, laughed and cried and remembered why I so loved this story. Casting was perfect, music, cinematography divine."
Becky,14-Jul-20,John Wick meets Home Alone is the best way I can think of describing it. When I first saw the trailer I wanted to watch the film to see Kevin James in a dramatic/dark performance. He gives a good performance but Becky (LuLu Wilson) steals the show for sure. Not going to win any awards but entertaining and worth the watch.
Becky,05-Jun-20,"This movie should be called 'Bambo'. A teenage girl that weighs about 90 pounds turns vigilante on a few 200 pound dudes, making their lives pure hell. Not only does she do a Jackie Chan kick off of a tree house swing, she has Terminator like wit by using original one liners. It was painful to watch Kevin James perform in over an hour of this type of tomfoolery. Leprechaun in the Hood was better than this film. This film gave me hope that my next book can become an Academy Award winning film. So it wasn't all bad, I'm just playing, actually it was pretty horrible! The marshmallow and fire seen at the end was epic!"
Becky,02-Jul-20,"How is it that 4 men, who have escaped from prison, aren't able to take down one little girl. I'm a huge Kevin James fan but THIS...was a waste of time!"
Becky,06-Jun-20,I've never left a review on here before but I feel entitled to leave one now. This movie was a waste of 90 minutes. Makes zero sense in any way and a completely unsatisfying ending. Casting Kevin James and Joel McHale is a complete waste.Watch if you really want to see action but other than that I simply can't reccomend this. A very poorly done film.
Becky,05-Jun-20,"This is another home invasion thriller, brutal, gory n fast paced.
This time the family which gets attacked is a stubborn girl n her father n her soon to be step mom n step bro. As usual, the home is secluded n there r no nearby neighbors. The family is attacked by escaped neo nazi convicts.
The young girl gave a lovely performance but it was surprising to see Kevin James in a very different role.
The film managed to keep me glued to know the secret of the key but.....
A sequel shud be made about the key n Lulu getting special training n recruitment."
Becky,28-Jun-20,"Kevin James as a bad guy was the most appealing thing about this movie , I had excitment for this film but ultimately it's just plan bad , Kevin was the only intriguing casting , LuLu wilson Is pretty horrible in this film , her wide eyes the whole film was he fail safe to seem like she had a grasp on her character. Also there is a major Plot Point NEVER discussed , why was the key in their lake house in the first place !?!?!?! And what exactly was it for ???? It's never explained . Also people who see loved ones die or get tortured usually show some major emotion.... these character get over it in seconds .... major let down of a film ."
Becky,06-Jun-20,Unrealistic teenage empowerment flick with zero character development
Becky,10-Jul-20,"This movie is off its head, not to realistic yet in your face bold.Its not scared to show you blood.There are some graphic scenes, yet it's more intense as it revolves around a young girl.Acting is great on set and the way this movie delivers is exceptional."
Becky,13-Jul-20,Surprisingly good story line with gore. It like Home Alone but with realist consequences of the traps. The secret key story is good for you to ponder further.
Becky,10-Jun-20,"""Becky"" is a ridiculous and unsatisfying would-be-thriller, which is never thrilling, never believable, and even fails to shock. This is down to the fact that the graphic violence it resorts to is more likely to bring laughter than unease, as is the ridiculous character arc taken by the titular Becky, which completely leaves any semblance of believability behind.For most of the movie I was reminded of one of those forgotten thrillers that were everywhere back in the '90s. How hard is it to make a good thriller? It must be nigh on impossible, given how many there are, and how few manage to thrill. The set-up is pretty typical: a family reeling from the death of their matriarch is beset by escaped convicts looking for a missing key that for some reason is located in the family home.You know that this is a modern movie, however, for two reasons: the ridiculous, over-the-top violence, and the fact that the movie goes on a similarly ridiculous ""girl power"" tangent, where we see a thirteen-year-old facing off against four or five hardened criminals.About that violence: in one scene, a man gets stabbed in the eye, and goes back into the house with his eyeball dangling out on its nerve. He asks another guy to cut the nerve (as you do) and that guy fails to do it, apparently not cutting hard enough with a butcher knife, so the guy cuts his own eyeball off instead.I did not see this movie in the theatre, but if I had, I bet that scene would have been a laugh riot. It's like something out of a horror comedy, and yet the movie is not comedic at all.Despite, of course, the presence of Paul Blart himself, Kevin James. Comedians have played villainous roles before to great effect, ie. Robin Williams in ""Insomnia"" and ""One Hour Photo"" and Jerry Lewis in ""King of Comedy"". With this movie Kevin James shows us he does not have it in him. He is not intimidating at all in this role.The ridiculousness of the movie's violence converges neatly with its girl-power angle. Any movie about somebody surviving and turning the tables on a group of bad guys features that person unleashing their inner MacGyver, ie. fashioning traps and tools in a matter of moments. But who expected the girl to be such an enthusiastic participant in the carnage?It's not like the movie shies away from that realisation, but that doesn't make it any less stupid."
Becky,03-Jul-20,"The film contains shocking scenes and pictures that are difficult to watch.
Besides, it doesn't make much sense to him, how a confused girl doesn't know what to do suddenly becomes some great wisdom. And the scene of the fat man who can't swim seems to be taken from an antique cartoon ..."
Becky,24-Jun-20,"That's the most stupid movie i have ever seen. So much nonsense, meaningless"
Becky,29-Jun-20,"Not what I was expecting at all. Loved it. I was gripped throughout. Funny, gory, and kinda fantastic."
Becky,08-Jun-20,"It's a violent version of Home Alone - but not as believable.A very unlikeable 12 year old girl suddenly turns into an assassin that outsmarts and brutally takes out 4 grown men. The movie can't decide whether it wants to be gritty, or ridiculously / hilariously unrealistic.The chemistry between the characters is terrible. The girl, as mentioned, is too unlikeable to root or care for. The plot is not the most exciting. And the motives of the villains centre around a mysterious key - in which its purpose is never even revealed.So as far as the view is left concerned, a whole bunch of violence and death occurs for absolutely nothing."
Becky,05-Jun-20,Movie is so-so with a mediocre plot. Story line is very weak that could be better in so many ways but the writer failed to do so.The only good thing about this movie was Lulu Wilson's acting. She's a true gem. A new rising-star for Horror/Thriller genre films.
Becky,01-Jul-20,"I was very excited to see this movie because of Kevin James being the villain, but it was so boring, unrealistic, and didn't make sense at all, the actress is so annoying and unlikable, her acting sucks, and so many plot holes, and I just wanted it to end, so disappointed. Please don't waste your time."
Becky,05-Jun-20,"I actually really liked this one, I also don't get why people aren't liking this one, guess they don't like fun movies"
Becky,06-Jun-20,"I think almost everyone enjoys to see a comedian break away from the laughs and turn serious for a role, or in this case even villainous. Kevin James executes this extremely played out and cliche Aryan brotherhood/supremacist/convict character as well as he could've with what barren script he was given.Everything starts out with some solid character development with the young Lulu Wilson with her struggles and current emotional situation. As things progress we fly ahead into the start of the action and are introduced to the ever cliche written group of villains with intensity and mystery. At this point it appears as though they will explain a certain plot device in which the antagonists are after, but they fail to do so. Then things start getting gruesome and very fast paced and you still wonder what they are truly after. Towards the final act just when you think they'll explain what the point of all this was, we are once again left hanging without any true explanation of their intentions with the main object they were after rendering the whole story nearly useless other than for extreme brutality and revenge empowerment.As I mentioned the film has some decently entertaining performances by James and Wilson, and some solid production value, but there is almost no story here. If they would've simply given an explanation to the motives of these convicts and wrapped up some loose ends, it could've been slightly better. Instead it just feels like a hollow and cliche revenge thriller."
Becky,06-Jun-20,"I've never written a single comment for any movie, but this one I feel responsible to warn people DO NOT waste your 90 minutes of life like I just did. None of the castings is connected to their characters. But that doesn't seem to be a problem since the storyline doesn't make any sense. everything looks so cheap in this movie except for the cameras."
Becky,27-Jun-20,"I rented this movie and when i was 20 minutes in... i hated it already, it's more of a WTF is going on movie. The movie felt like a sequel and the main villian a.k.a my boy Kevin James playing as him can tell he regreted playing this. Also don't show it to kids, there is lots of gore and violence."
Becky,06-Jun-20,"There are many films made along the same theme, but this one entertains. Becky has a bad attitude and is a resentful thirteen year old adolescent girl. These habits become her assets in an hour of need when she stubbornly becomes very resourceful and solves various problems that are put in her way.An enjoyable, thrilling movie to watch!"
Becky,07-Jun-20,The only point worth writing about is to say that the actors need to call their agents and fire them.
Becky,22-Jun-20,"Sure, the sullen, bratty Becky is easy to hate at the beginning of the movie--but who didn't like watching growling Becky exacting gory justice! Watch it just to rewind the killing scenes! And of course, its sequel-ready!"
Becky,28-Jun-20,"Not sure if they are going to make a sequel and made this movie just to present background of a new type of devilish kid heroin. Whether that's the case or not the movie failed to show how Becky builds up to her explosion or removal of emotion caused by her lost mom, unexpected step mother, and death of her father. Nothing explained about the key and background or purpose of the gang but Nazi tattoo on the leader's body only. Simply it's like watching the first episode of a new TV series where you often witness extremely shocking scenes and hints that make you want to watch the next episode for follow ups.
This is Kick-Ass without hero costume and least enough background which makes it almost like child porn only required to satisfy watchers' need for bloody justice by telling nasty head-shredding revenge story but by a child protagonist."
Becky,19-Jun-20,"How on the earth is a 12 year old girl capable of killing a group of criminals who ran away from prison in such nasty way, considering that only one of them is the size of a monster????
This is the most disturbing, disgusting and awful movie I've ever watched....
Moreover, I would NEVEEEERRRR let my kids of anyyyy age watch such a horrible movie. How is a kid allowed to play such disgusting role in such a stupid movie like this????
Where is our society going to with such worthless products being made??
I am in a deep shock and fully speechless."
Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,25-Apr-20,"I LOVE Star Wars films and couldn't see this film fast enough. All I can say is what was that all about? It was quite boring. Did anyone even edit this film? Rey's character was not likable. The only person tolerable was Chewie. Leia died of shame. Nothing happened anyone cared about. The dialogue was not clever. The film never went anywhere at all. It was just endless scenes of magical occurrences. People galloping on horses (read that again). Magic over kill. By the time the ending happened I didn't care anymore. I wanted to LOVE this movie, but I haven't been this bored in a long long time. I wish i felt differently."
Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,18-May-20,"They are so used to making films for four-year olds that they thought the force is magic. There are magical and inexplicable wizardry happening all the time. Who knew 'Jedi' can heal the drying and mortally wounded? All those Jedi didn't need to die in episodes I-III! If only Yoda had known!!
It is not just that nurse Rey is so magical. People fly, people transport items across the galaxy, people come back from the dead and intervene/assist/interfere and the list continues.Twinkle twinkle little star...."
Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,17-Jun-20,"A nonsense movieA lot of dumb stuff here, at times, and is unintentionally funny or just creates plot holes and no real sense of Star Wars other it makes money. But hey it's just a dumb corporate movie and I will say it's reasonably well done with its fx at times."
Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,06-Jun-20,"They are terrible and this is the worst of the bunch.I was expecting to see Mary Sue goddess omniscient omnipresent reincarnation of Buddha Rey don a nurse's cap and start touching everything and anything with her healing powers.What a joke.She was even worse than the horse strutting on the starship in space!! Read that again and understand why no one older than 4 will like this.Yes, Star Wars went from the world's foremost action adventure to the biggest joke."
Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,18-Apr-20,"So it motivated me to finally register and add my own reviews.Obviously that is the only way they can get a couple of positive (spammy) reviews of this turkey in here. They already have a fake rating for it.The truth is that this piece of corporate vomit sucked. It sucked hard. The actress (nurse Ridley something) heals the boo boo of her bff. The horseback warriors gallop in space (yes I repeat in space) and evade intergalactic warfare technology by trotting and rolling on and off horseback, the dollar store masked emo has the mask and then doesn't have it at will and of course a dead character shows up out of nowhere (yup the old sitcom trick) and bores our pants off.One last note: hilarious that Bad Robot spammers are on here laming The Last Jedi. Who produced The Last Jedi? Check this website. That is right. JJ 'I rip off for a living'; Abrams."
Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,12-Jun-20,PAGING DOCTOR REY!We have an emo patient here and he has a boo boo. Please come to emergency and make his boo boo go away.Doctor Mary Sue Rey to Emergency.
Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,28-May-20,"This and the entire sequel trilogy is nothing more than a billion dollar corporate money grab. It has just as much claim to being serious as the Star Wars Holiday Special does. Heck, the Holiday Special had all the original actors!
These people? So bad they are not even aware of their own ignorance."
Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,02-May-20,"I watched and observed. I planned and plotted. At the stroke of midnight I jumped over the wall of LucasFilms headquarters and evaded the security camera and the guards. I scooted to the building's far wall in less than six seconds and broke through the unwired basement window. I was in, but there was still a long way to go and motion detectors to avoid!There was a foul stench in the air.I took a big gulp of my oxygen tank.I ran to the left and managed to creep forward with a lurch. Two rights, straight ahead and up the stairs before turning left twice and running down the stairs. I was behind a big black velvety door now. The secret maps smuggled out were correct! I hope they would continue to be so. Well, I had trained for this.I uttered the magical words I had rehearsed a thousand times. My mouth still could not get used to the taste of sulfur that permeated my tongue, larynx, nostrils and even ears. No time to taste the acrid stench now.The door opens and I run down the stairs, there is a beady drape here that I did not know about. Overconfidence had made them not post any guards. I got past the drape and shone a light on the blackened scene.It burnt my eyes, but my gaze persisted.I was in the temple of the sith."
Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,24-Apr-20,"News that is. Very good news.
It is the last one. We don't have to see this cast and crew again (until sequel time in 2021).More good news: business schools across the country have fresh material on how to destroy, destruct, implode, explode, blow up, drill, sabotage, crush a much vaunted and respected cultural phenomenon and turn it into a Sunday morning cartoon (with even worse acting)."
Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,02-May-20,"They have horses (yup horses) on the outside of a starship galloping while the star destroyer is in motion and beating the weaponry of the empire in terms of speed*!
*JJ Abrams read somewhere that Lucas' vision was a Western in space and he got the wrong idea."
Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,30-May-20,"Words cannot describe the disgust that is this film. JJ Abrams did a standard job, worse than anything anybody could do/ever has done. Cheap cast, cartoonish so-called action, cheap effects for the sake of effects, not a single pretty cute girl men want to look at.Avoid this film, even if you're a Star Wars fan, because you will become disturbed with the state of the world. I'll definitely never watch this or the tens of crappy 'Star Wars'-related nonsenses Disney will release in the future.0/5 stars, 1/10, Worst big budget movie of 2015, Worst Star Wars movie....by far : )"
Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,18-May-20,Or yet another Ghostbusters!That is how atrocious the directing is. I could utter every word before the characters said them. So cliche-ridden.
Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,04-Jun-20,"Embarrassing
If there was a lower rating than 1, this film would deserve it. Was this written by a remedial Sunday school class? The rise (hahahaahaaaaa) is a selfish, stupid, and harmful film. If this movie was satire and called ""Bulls**t"", I would still give it a ZREO for even giving screen time to this nonsense. Geez... really, humans."
Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,12-Jan-20,"Thanks for your input and all the upvotes here.Now back to reality and a review for us viewers and Star Wars fans:The film is bad, as bad as the rest of the trilogy that was wholly unneeded and attempted to reboot the whole thing for Disney's kiddie demographic via copying what Lucas had done albeit with weak actors and actresses, no character development and cheap directing.Face it: the dark side won. The emperor is back and can return anytime, Yoda is dead and his vision has been quashed and a Mary Sue is running around magically Mary Suing the universe. The minions of the dark side are deep inside Disney and Bad Robot headquarters and making a billion dollar a pop from their evil visions and hordes of lemmings pay it to them.PS: I love the ignorant and the spammers constantly writing 'oh JJ fixed it.' WHO DO YOU THINK RUINED IT IN THE FIRST PLACE? Your beloved sith JJ was the director of 7 and producer of 8."
Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,23-Dec-19,"A terrible movie for Star Wars, cinema or art fans.
It crushes the force and takes Mary Sue-ism and unexplained occurrences to a new height. Frankly, and we have known this all along, the actors and actresses are poor.What is laughable is how the Disney contractors spamming here keep talking about how JJ Abrams saved the trilogy. Boys, tell head office to give you a new script, will you? JJ Abrams was the hack who ruined Star Wars in place. He was also the producer on the Rian Johnson impostor film."
Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,30-Apr-20,"Abysmal!!Same silliness once again. Also, JJ Abrams is without a clue. Full of annoying useless characters. Also, Rey is powerful out of nowhere again and even practies magical medicine."
Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,13-May-20,Thank goodness Kathleen Kennedy was just sacked from Star Wars or else there would be 3 more episodes with rey and she would by then be god herself (without even trying).
Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,24-Jun-20,"No words can describe how bad this film is. no story to tell, no characters to entertain."
Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,25-Jun-20,The story makes no senseThe amazons and horses were truly idioticThe reveal is lame and left me in disbeliefNo pretty women to check outThe last scene was so cheesy. No you are not a Skywalker. Seriously. you are not.
Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,29-Feb-20,"The art of good film making has been lost in the last decade. A whole lot of structural and continuity issues here with a weak script that gives JJ Abrams the opportunity to sell games and merchandise. The main actress has only one expression like she is angry at herself, as well as the audience.
Suggestion: there are only 6 episodes of Star Wars ever and only 3 of them are good."
Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,14-Jun-20,"The story makes no sense (Why is a major character dead? nobody knows. How is a major character bad? Nobody knows. How does magical healing happen? Nobody cares...)The acting is terrible. Amateur hour galore!The horses outrun galactic weaponry. Heck horses trot in space!Not a single pretty woman I want to fall for or look at.There is no 'rise' of anybody here let alone Skywalker.. The title is generated randomly by the Disney computer independent of the story.
Summation: I am in a good mood. 3 stars."
Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,05-Jan-20,"The good:
Cinematography
MusicThe bad:
No storyline. Palpatine came back somehow, was confronted by Rey and died again. It took her less than 2 minutes to finish him in the end all because dead Jedi suddenly decided to talk to her, comfort her she wasn't alone.The ugly:
Poe's speech before going into battle reminded me of every medieval movie I can remember. Then, 2 minutes later I saw a bunch of horses running across the deck of a Star Destroyer, freakin HORSES!Rey dies (why??) then Ben resurrects her (how??), they kiss (why??) and then he dies (vanishes), how&why??The RISE of Skywalker?? The 2 last remaining Skywalkers DIE!! There is NO Skywalker left.PLOT-BLACK-HOLESI remember downloading the storyline of all 9 chapters 16 years ago. The final trilogy was supposed to be about Leia & Han's kids, Luke's kids, a cloned version of Luke, a cloned version of Vader/Anakin and Luke eventually becoming the most powerful Jedi of all time after finally defeating the Sith in their ancient temple. The entire trilogy felt mystic, dark and after reading all 9 chapters the final 3 were undoubtedly going to be a ""save the best for last"" scenario. I am so disappointed. Star Wars is dead. Count me out."
Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,01-Jan-20,"Let us be frank with one another okay? This film is not needed, the whole trilogy was unneeded,there is no rule that says that Star Wars or any film needs to be a trilogy.Star Wars under Disney is a series looking for a reason to exist. Lucas, before he became a greedy sell-out, had a vision and an idea. he also had talent. The current crew are uniformly sad. There is no reason for the emo, masculine Mary Sue, fake clone or the impostor emperor to exist and they all require us to suspend disbelief anyway. The current gang has no story to tell.This film is stitched together to plug the holes JJ and Disney themselves created.
Do not watch it."
Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,04-Apr-20,"It is Battlefield earth!
Decades old aircraft rise from the depths and water and are staffed and ready to go!?!?!?There is a Strider style speech to a dying and dwindling force and because JJ is a rip off he has to steal from Star trek and has teleportation here too. BEAM ME AWAY FROM THIS CRAP"
Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,02-Jan-20,"This was a boring film. The Mary Sue is still there being a Mary Sue and defying the rules of the force. They also shoehorn a forced relationship.People are free to like it of course, but I do not understand all the reviews saying JJ Abrams rescued Star Wars (is it his employees??) because JJ (and Disney) are the ones who damaged Star Wars in the first place!! So he is the rescuer now?? What he rescued it from himself??Still a subpar film."
X-Men: Apocalypse,12-Feb-20,"Suffering from bizarre narrative choices and weak character development, X-Men: Apocalypse is an otherwise passable and occasionally great installment of the franchise, mainly due to the continued strong performances and glorious action set pieces."
X-Men: Apocalypse,06-Jun-16,"X-Men: Apocalypse is the sequel to Days of Future Past and takes place  about a decade later in the '80s. This movie entertained me from start  to finish and I can't say I was ever bored. But there are a lot of  things I was not satisfied with while watching. Starting off with the  good, Magneto and Professor X continue to be the best parts of these  movies. Michael Fassbender as Magneto is amazing and he has a really  emotional scene towards the beginning which got me locked into the  film. James McAvoy is also great as Xavier. The internal battles inside  Xavier's head were riveting. I really liked the new cast of the younger  X-Men, like Jean Grey, Storm, Nightcrawler, and Cyclops. Quicksilver  has another awesome scene just like the previous movie. The action is  handled very well for the most part. The first half of the movie is  terrific, but the second half brings it down.  Apocalypse as the villain was OK for me. Some scenes worked well and  others didn't. I was always skeptical of Oscar Isaac as Apocalypse and  I still don't think he was the best choice. He is just like Jesse  Eisenberg as Lex Luthor for me. Apocalypse is also a small mutant  compared to the others for some reason and he's just another villain  who is obsessed with destroying the world, and his motivations are  thin. Jennifer Lawrence was a boring Mystique. She just seems  uninspired throughout the run-time and becomes tedious since she uses  the personality over and over again to play the character. Some mutants  were completely wasted here with Psylocke and Angel. There's an entire  sequence in a secret lab and it seemed there for only one reason: the  cameo of a specific person. While it was fun to watch, it didn't do  much of anything for the story in the long run. The entire thing could  have been removed and the movie would have been the same. The final  battle felt underwhelming with the whole global extinction. The problem  is they don't show any civilians dying; it's just buildings coming  apart, making it hard to care about the situation.   Overall, X-Men: Apocalypse is a disappointing sequel to First Class and  Days of Future Past. But it is not at all a bad movie. Magneto and  Professor X are once again great, Apocalypse is a mixed bag, the pacing  for the movie is all over the place, and the dull second half just  brings the film down from the really good first half.  X-Men: Apocalypse gets a B-."
X-Men: Apocalypse,20-May-16,"I personally thought Days of the Future Past to be the best of the series. And as it turns out, Apocalypse is the worst one to date.The only bright spot in all the awfulness is Quicksilver, whose slo-mo scene is at least as good as in the previous movie, if not better. Other than that, everything else goes from mediocre to outright terrible.The main villain's motivation is bland and stupid. (Yeah, he just wants to kill everyone and rule the world.) The way he ""persuades"" other mutants to join him is absolutely unbelievable - he basically just offers to increase a mutant's power and in return demands help to kill billions of people. Sounds like a fair deal. What's offputting is that the extent to which he augments his followers' powers is not constant. Like, Magneto gains the power to control pretty much all the metal on the planet at once, while Psylocke gains another special effect on her CGI laser beams or whatever it is that she emits. Apocalypse's abilities in general are largely undefined - at times he is shown pulling matter from objects around him to construct something, and then in the next shot he just makes solid objects like armor out of thin air. Another ridiculous thing was that they tried to make Isaac more intimidating by giving him thick soles so that he'd look taller, which is noticeable. What is more, his lines are cringe-worthy, but the problem is, so are everyone else's. Same boring cliché dialogues like ""It's your home. We will help. Join us, Eric. I see good in you.""Yeah, forgiving Magneto like it's nothing after he helps to kill millions of people and destroy entire cities is included in the package. Also, he changes his mind about the whole ""destroy the world"" thing after Mystique tells him for the 100th time that he is her family and she still sees good in him.Some of the characters' looks are still beyond ugly. I can actually see why they chose to try to keep the Beast and Mystique in their human forms more, except for saving the actors from the extensive make-up procedures. The thing is, these characters look absolutely god-damn atrocious and are painful to watch. I mean, Lawrence is annoying and redundant when she is on screen anyway, but when she is also blue, it just becomes vomit-inducing.Recent 2016 comic-book blockbusters also did not enjoy good scripts, but at least they had high-quality gripping action scenes. This is not the case here, as fighting is mostly goofy and bland, and at times it is clearly visible by the actors' motions that they are being pulled by the strings. Or being drawn in cheap CGI.This is actually sad. Singer's previous movie, DotFP, was outstanding. The recent Deadpool, who ostensibly shares the universe with the X-men, was awesome. And now we get a horrible, outrageously stupid and pretentious CG-overdosed mess. Let's hope the next one will be better."
X-Men: Apocalypse,30-Jun-16,"There was very little that surprised me about the quality of this movie. I knew that it would be a step down from DOFP, but would likely still have a good story with a few problems. Some of the problems were not of the sort I expected. The heightened stakes proved to be less of an issue than I expected. It held back some of the emotional appeal, but not that much. The characters ended up being more of a problem than I had hoped, which was too bad because the other two requels did a really good job with character development.In this case, there were a few too many characters too give them proper depth, I suppose. The returning characters were good. Charles and Erik were very engaging, and you knew where their philosophies were at. Charles got to be kind of cool this time around rather than just wise. Erik's feeling of entitlement to his rage is brought to a new level. The other returning characters of Moira, Hank, Raven, and Peter were pretty good. It was great to see a little more Quicksilver action. I thought Hank felt more natural this time around. Raven was a little forced, but not as much as I'd feared from her prominence in the trailer. However, the new characters were a big problem. They weren't very well introduced, and didn't really make you want to root for them. The three lesser Horsemen were hardly given any attention, and even the new protagonists were very poorly developed. I suppose some of this can be accounted for by their being in the original three, but it still didn't turn out good. Of course, we can't forget our villain, Apocalypse, who is interesting in more ways than might be expected. I was afraid we might get a flat villain, but his motive is actually pretty good. I really liked how he abhorred tools, especially when he got rid of all the Cold War nukes. Robbing his enemy of weapons rather than using those weapons himself revealed so much about his value on natural power and ego.The story as a whole was decent, but some of the scenes were excellent. I loved the opening with the transference of Apocalypse. Magneto losing his family was also done really well, along with his subsequent recruitment by Apocalypse. The climax was also pretty good, and the fashion in which Apocalypse was defeated, while it felt a little clichéd, still felt plausible and thematic. However, the entire sequence in Col. Stryker's base with Wolverine and everything was totally unnecessary. It made sense that he would capture the mutants at that point, but that space could have been filled much better.The visuals were top-notch, which is to be expected. The Quicksilver scene was probably the best spfx scene overall. The script did a decent job with dialogue, but it didn't do very well with shifting focus between the different groups of characters at the right pace. The acting from the returning roles was good, but the new faces gave some flat performances. I was particularly unimpressed with Sophie Turner as Jean Grey.The theme of mutants fitting in with the rest of society was not touched upon very much here. It comes up a bit in Hank and Raven's conversation and the stage fight between Angel and Nightcrawler. There is more of a focus on controlling and unleashing abilities, mostly with Jean and Scott, but It's rarely addressed. However, the way Apocalypse amplifies his followers' powers is rather interesting. With the exception of Angel, he really just tells them ""You have so much undiscovered potential, let me show you how to tap into it.""So, as you've probably already heard, it's not the best of the X-Men movies, but that doesn't make it bad. If you think you'll want to see it at some point, go catch it now while it's still in theaters rather than waiting and watching it on your computer for free. It's definitely a movie you want to see on a big screen. You should see at least First Class and DOFP first because the events of both are referenced and there are a couple of flashbacks to them as well. There are only a couple of references to the original movies, pretty much just in the Wolverine cameo, so if allusions like ""would you prefer yellow spandex?"" annoy you, don't worry too much. If you hate save-the-world plots, this is better than most, but it still has most of the prototypical elements. Overall Rating: 8.4/10."
X-Men: Apocalypse,10-Jun-16,"I loved all the X-Men movies, including X-Men Origins: Wolverine. I was so hyped when I heard they were creating an X-Men movie with Apocalypse in it. I have always loved superhero movies about the end of days. I will say specific parts that I loved and thought about this film and how I would recommend it.How good is this movie? It may not top the previous X-Men movies but that doesn't mean the movie is terrible. It is all based on opinion. Don't be scared to see the movie all because critics are making this movie look bad, go see it for yourself for your own opinion. You decide whether the movie is good or not. In my opinion, it is actually good. Not great, but good.Are the younger versions of the X-Men in this film? Yes. We have a younger version of Cyclops, Jean, Nightcrawler and Storm. We also have many amazing recurring members from the previous movies such as the young Professor X who was amazing, a slight older Magneto, Mystique who is also a little older and Beast who is still young as ever. And yes, Quicksilver returns and tops his amazing scene from X-Men: Days of Future's Past. How is Apocalypse the character? Honestly, I feel that Apocalypse was a little weaker than his comic version. If he was CGI like Thanos from Guardians of the Galaxy, he would've looked more threatening and tyrannical. I could basically compare this Apocalypse to a wimp who cosplays as Apocalypse with really good make up. His role is almost similar to Ultron.Is Wolverine in this? Yes! He may have a small cameo but it is a damn excellent cameo! When Wolverine enters the screen, the film basically transforms into an R-Rated action scene. Now that is who Wolverine is. It is also based on the real weapon x origin of Wolverine. He acts like a wild animal and slashes anyone who gets in his way and even this guy who begged Wolverine for mercy got his face ripped off! How dark is this film? It is actually pretty dark. There is a lot of death and depressing moments you will feel. We also get more connected with Magneto and why he hates humanity so much. It almost felt as he was the main antagonist in this film. We see his past and his present and why he turned into a dark and yet powerful supervillain. Also, the way Apocalypse murders people is pretty brutal and frightening.Would you recommend it? Of course! Like I said, it may not top the previous X-Men films but that doesn't mean it is terrible. If you love X-Men, as well as apocalyptic superhero movies, then this is the film for you. Go see it!"
X-Men: Apocalypse,05-Jun-16,"X-Men: Apocalypse was very fun, but got quite messy at parts. X-Men fans will like this just like I did. it is a huge step down from Days of Future Past and has a pretty clichéd villain. I forgave the clichéd villain because of how cool and how frightening he was. Oscar Isaac did so good as Apocalypse. The characters are well developed, but some of them do not get enough screen time and some get to much. Angel, Psyloche and Storm have no motivation, there is no reason why they agreed to help Apocalypse destroy the world. What would they gain? Overall I thought the movie was good, I had a blast watching it and will be watching it again."
X-Men: Apocalypse,10-May-16,"Okay, this is already the fourth superhero film we have gotten so far this year. The fact that it's this good blows my mind, it's the sixth entry in the main X-Men series, and it might be the third best after X2 and Days of Future Past. Oscar Isaac gives an outstanding performance as the mutant menace: Apocalypse, he was the highlight of the film right next to Fassbender's Magneto (who never fails to deliver). In a year with pathetic and disappointing superhero film villains so far, Apocalypse gives us the layered and threatening performance we want from our villains. Evan Peters returns as Quicksilver once more to give us an amazing scene that tops the one from Days of Future Past. The newcomers are fantastic and exciting and we will certainly see them again in the future. They also finally got Cyclops right! Forget about Rotten Tomatoes and go see this film opening weekend, you won't regret!"
X-Men: Apocalypse,18-May-16,"As you can probably gather I thought this was another very good addition to the X-Men franchise. Whilst it doesn't hit the heady heights of Days of Future Past it still is a really good watch and I fail to see why it has had a mixed press.Firstly I found it to have a perfectly serviceable story, with Apocalypse and his followers recruiting the very vulnerable and angry Magneto as part of his plan to destroy civilisation and rebuild it in his image. Fassbender turns in another solid performance and you really feel his pain and confusion for the Erik/Magneto character. I also thought all the supporting cast were absolutely fine in their roles, and to me Evan Peters as Quicksilver really stole the scenes he was in and makes a fine addition to the cast. The same also goes to Tye Sheridan as Scott/Cyclops, whose back story is filled in better and with more depth than it was in the Wolverine origins film.I see the critics have been moaning about having too many characters in the film, yet I actually think it was handled better than it was in the Captain America: Civil War film. In Apocalypse the large cast do actually have something to do and contribute to the story, whereas the Captain America film felt like some were shoe horned in, which I felt made that film feel bloated and repetitive whereas this one at least get the storyline moving. I felt that Civil War felt way too long because of all the story padding yet Apocalypse, whilst also a long film, kept my interest to the end (and yes there is a post credits scene that I suspect is setting up Wolverine 3). I should also add that Apocalypse, despite it's bleak story, does have some moments of humour and wit that went down well with the audience.I also felt the surprise appearance of Wolverine fitted in nicely with the back story that we already know, particularly the one told in X Men 2 and the Origins film, nicely closing that particular characters story arc and fitting in perfectly with the circumstances surrounding his appearance in the very first X-Men film of 16 years ago. If this is to be Wolverines final appearance with the X-men then they have given him a lovely send off.I did find some minor flaws with the film though, particularly with the visual appearance of some of the characters and how their ages don't compute when the first X-men film of 2000 is taken into account. However, asides from that I thoroughly enjoyed X-Men Apocalypse and thought it was a solid & worthy addition to the other X-Men films. The films had spectacle, action, laughs and carried on with the journeys of the characters we have got to know and love over the past sixteen years."
X-Men: Apocalypse,15-Aug-16,"This is not going to be a long review, i want to summarize my thoughts on the film, now after i just saw it in the cinema.The movie is absolutely spectacular. The effects, the settings, the pacing, the acting, the music, the direction. It is all very well done, and if the story itself had kept up with the rest, this would be close to one of the best, if not the best, superhero film to date.But the story is a bit weak, it's hard to take in a few of the twists and turns in this film, but still everything else is so brilliantly crafted, the movie pulls it off anyways, and that makes me feel i got my moneys worth. This is very important to me when i go the cinema. I need to walk out feeling i was entertained.I'm usually the guy that puts story and script first when it comes to films. Way to often when the story is bad, the script and the acting and all the rest that follows almost always seem half done. This is not the case here.This movie is like when you bake a cake, and you end up putting in a small amount of salt instead of sugar. You notice you did, but you don't have time to fix your mistake, so you bake the cake to the best of your abilities anyways. At the end it's one hell of a spectacular looking cake you made, but people notice the taste is a bit off, but somehow the added salt contributed to the flavor in a good way, and the cake was very much edible.This is how i feel after seeing this film. It is really well crafted, and i do recommend people seeing it."
X-Men: Apocalypse,22-May-16,"This movie is astoundingly terrible. The first 45 minutes of the film feel like bad long exposition and yet nothing really happens, a mutant appears in some random scene and they are recruited by either Apocalypse or the X-Men. The writing is all over the place and we don't get to know the characters, they're simply put there.Because Bryan Singer is in love wit Stryker of course we get to see the Weapon X program (again!) and of course, Wolverine because why not.As for the characters: Magneto barely does anything in the whole movie, Apocalypse is a one note villain, Xavier phoned it in and Jennifer Lawrence was NOT Mystique at all, as expected she played Raven Everdeen.Finally, the big battle comes and nothing really happened, the world is being destroyed and the governments sit quiet. SPOILER ALERT! And the way they defeat Apocalypse is by combining all their powers, just like in FANTASTIC FOUR (2005) or even FANT4STIC (2015).This movie has NO SOUL whatsoever, boring, badly acted, awful written, the worst movie of the year so far."
X-Men: Apocalypse,04-Jun-16,"The word ""apocalypse"" brings to mind an end-of-the world event of biblical proportions. X- MEN APOCALYPSE brings to mind some Japanese anime and a yearning for the better X- men movies of the past. The third in this ""new trilogy"" that began with X-MEN FIRST CLASS, the franchise reached its high point in the epic X-MEN DAYS OF FUTURE PAST but now tips back down to a rather typical tale of good vs evil intertwined with the usual hero's journey. Thankfully the masterful execution of dialogue and acting chops saves this film from sinking into mediocrity.There are lot of plot threads to follow. Fortunately or unfortunately it does not require much inferring or complex thinking to follow the story. It is very simple and it is in its simplicity that it loses out on the richness of character than past xmen movies had. Our characters are all reduced to two dimensional archetypes each with familiar story arcs. So familiar in fact that the whole movie is a pastiche of plot points taken from past xmen movies. Eric is the grief stricken blood knight who goes evil with vengeance when tragedy strikes, again. Scott jean and Kurt are the inexperienced loners who have to work together to overcome their challenges, a little like pyro, Bobby drake (ice man) and kitty pryde (shadow cat) in X-men 2. Mystique replaces wolverine as the badass wanderer who is thrown into a leadership position to guide our young loners. Xavier is once again captured and the X-men's home base is compromised, again like X-MEN 2. Powerful mutant with delusions of godhood and a gang of loyal followers is Apocalypse this time replacing magneto's role in the first 3 xmen movies. Call it homage or call it cliché, I feel that this story manages to toe the line between familiar and fresh. The familiar elements gives us a sense of the revolving nature of conflict, that history repeats despite the best intentions. The fresh elements of course add new facets to a film which could have otherwise been a complete bore, thanks to the slow burn nature of the plot which mostly sees both good guys and bad guys gathering their key players for the final showdown. Those who can appreciate a slow build up would love this while those who need their immediate action fix would be left disappointed.Divisive might be the best word to describe this movie. When the action does come, it is a special effects spectacle of mutant powers on display where everyone.......pretty much stands around shooting things at each other. Oh look, the villain is getting the upper hand! Let's shoot more! Where physical stunts and fights come, they are a thrill to behold except the dated wire work which feels artificial. Interspersed between these divisive battles are particular scenes of movie magic. Quicksilver (last see in DAYS OF FUTURE PAST) returns and we get to see the full extent of his powers once again only on a larger scale. And at least this time he has a purpose in the story other than being a just a miraculous attempt. But as mentioned earlier his motivations are touched on but not explored. His character is simplified into yet another archetype.Beneath the visual spectacle, the movie under utilises its cast of characters. Ty Sheridan's Scott Summers could have been great as the new audience surrogate, going from meek bullied loser to taking his first steps as confident leader of the X-Men. Instead he is also shoved into the background after his introduction. Kodi-smith mcfee's more feline looking Nightcrawler is also another intriguing character sidelined. Instead we get more Charles Xavier and more Eric playing out their character drama like star crossed lovers. Don't get me wrong, they are fantastic actors, especially Michael Fassbender completely nailing the tragedy of Eric's character arc. But their story came to a decent close in the last movie and this one just feels like more of the same.Apocalypse himself is a villain that is as equally divisive as the movie itself. On one hand, it seemed that the creators were going for the ""all powerful but frail"" type of villain ala emperor Palpatine of Star Wars. The snake-like menace that Oscar Isaac exudes through his sinister delivery is betrayed by a design that borders on corny. Oversized platform boots, plastic looking Armour and an ill defined set of powers all downplay the threatening presence of the villain. His motivations could have been much deeper. A commentary on modern commercialism replacing the religions of old perhaps as the new ""cult following""? Or a criticism of humanity's arrogance and self glorifying nature? Maybe even a critique on how common folk are quick to idolise mortal ""false gods"" of the influential and powerful? No, no and no. None of that thematic depth here. Apocalypse is merely your Saturday morning cartoon variety villain who wants to destroy the world to rebuild in his image.It is not a bad movie per se. Visually stunning, an easy-to-follow plot and well cast characters set to a script filled with witty dialogue that does not overdo the comedy. The acting is professional and the music by John Ottman is a grand thematic continuation of But for a grand finale it pales in comparison to films like X-MEN 2 by glossing over its deeper themes of social commentary especially, in the treatment of mutants as an allegory to prejudice against social minorities. It lacks the urgency, high stakes tension and emotional depth of DAYS OF FUTURE PAST and the chemistry among the cast is no where near XMEN FIRST CLASS. I would place it as a middling entry into the X-men franchise that succeeds in opening the doors to a whole new generation of X-men movies."
X-Men: Apocalypse,03-Jun-16,I've got to be honest. This was the comic book movie I was least looking forward to this year but I went to see it anyway because the trailers made it look decent. I didn't go in expecting much but I was surprised when I really enjoyed this movie. It is no where near as good as First Class and Days of Future Past but it is still worth your time. Apocalypse was a great villain and Oscar Isaacs played him brilliantly. I also didn't mind the costume that much (It could have been better though). Most of the cast was really good in the film (My favourite being Evan Peters as Quicksilver). However unfortunately Jennifer Lawrence was not at her best in this film. She just didn't have the enthusiasm and looked bored for most of the film. I also didn't really like the actress that played Jean Grey. I'm not sure what her name is but to me she was just kind of wooden and boring to watch. I do wish that they could have developed the horseman though (Not counting Magneto) because it seemed like they didn't have much reason to suddenly be bad (Especially Psylocke). The things this film sets up also gets you quite exited for future instalments. I definitely think it is a good thing that they seem to be re-doing The Dark Phoenix Saga and possibly introducing one of my favourite X-Men villains: Mr Sinister. Overall this film is enjoyable and any comic book fan will most likely enjoy it because it is still better than Batman Vs Superman.
X-Men: Apocalypse,27-May-16,"I loved the Apocalypse storyline of the 90s animated series so I was pretty stoked about the idea of a movie centering around the Apocalypse character, it's a shame I have to live with it now.The new cast can't seem to hold up a movie on their own, McAvoy is a huge miscast 3 movies later, Fassbender struggles to hold up the movie. It seems like their veteran counterparts did most of the work these past couple of films.Apocalypse is terrible, I had reservations about him before, but you can tell they didn't know where to go with him or how to handle him so they kinda just piggybacked off of stargate. There's this strange pedo-like relationship he has with his younger horsemen. The wolverine cameo was so forced and out of place you'd think this were a superhero spoof movie.There's a random scene where the new gang of mutants goes to the movies and jean literally says ""At least we can agree on one thing: the third movie is always the worst"" and it cuts back to the movie. The scene literally has nothing to do with the rest of the story its just spliced in there for some reason.Which begs me to question whether the cast knew how terrible it was and just did not care."
X-Men: Apocalypse,11-Oct-16,Wait a minute.. just wait a minute...A bloke with superpowers does a lot of damage.. sees the light.. tries to be a good bloke in Poland.. tries to help someone.. gets found out.. wife and kid are efficiently skewered by a single arrow.. he gets all moody and turns into a bad bloke...Then.. this bad bloke with boiling blood.. murders millions of people .. MILLIONS .. as he redesigns planet Earth by uprooting thousand of buildings and crushing MILLIONS of poor saps stuck between the basement and the penthouse.Then he has a change of heart and becomes a good bloke again.. and the other good bloke says... 'See.. I knew you had a nice side'Then he walks away with a fetching Irish grin.The wailing of the MILLIONS of bereaved seem to go unheard.Rubbish.
X-Men: Apocalypse,05-Jun-16,"En Sabah Nur is Apocalypse, the first mutant who ruled ancient Egypt until he was entombed. It's the 80's. CIA agent Moira MacTaggert goes to Egypt and witnesses his emergence. He recruits his four horsemen Magneto, Storm, Psylocke, and Angel giving them greater power. Meanwhile, Raven recruits Kurt Wagner/Nightcrawler from an East Berlin fight club. Alex Summers brings his younger brother Scott to Professor Charles Xavier's school. Quicksilver arrives at the school just in time to rescue almost everybody from an explosion but Professor X is kidnapped by Apocalypse.I really like the first half. There are some good introduction of the new characters. It's working fine for the most part. It hits the pinnacle with Quicksilver's rescue which is funny and exciting. It is visually dynamic and a joy to behold. The rest of the movie feels like a long slow slide into mediocrity.The most troubling problem for the continuing franchise is the use of Mystique as the leading X-Men. That character has never been in that role. JLaw is struggling to put out the intensity to match the central part. She and her character is not up to the task so far. It's also funny that her powers is to not be JLaw. The other problem is Apocalypse. I hoped for better but his mega-destruction is underwhelming. It's a lot of bland and his powers are nebulous. I actually think it would have been better to allow Apocalypse to be a two-parter. As an one-and-done villain, he isn't allowed to be anything more than a monster of the moment. With a lower level of power from him, it could be more compelling to struggle for the soul of each horseman. As it stands, the character Apocalypse is nothing special."
X-Men: Apocalypse,21-May-16,"Another X-Men movie.. and again, not much of anything happens. There is a plot, yes, but it is poorly written and lacks substance/soul/meaning. The attitude of ""I don't care"" is what I came out with after seeing this movie. Instead of having a soul, it feels like a bunch of things put together in order to make money. You see characters, but aside from Quicksilver, which felt shoved in, no one really has an attempt at an arc.--- SPOILERS!!An hour into the movie, it SEEMS like something will happen. Two hours into the movie, they end the threat of Apocalypse. The end. Apocalypse wasted. I have several other issues with this movie, 1) Nightcrawler's teleportation is stopped by electricity? 2) Apocalypse access the internet by touching a TV. Yes yes, it is not the internet, but it is such a concept. Anyway, Apocalypse learns all the languages this way and sees the atrocities of humanity. What kind of powers did he have? He came from the beginning of mankind, and then jumps to the ""present"" where he magically has a mutant power that lets him access ""technology"". Anyway, awful! Reading minds would have been better. 3) The Angel transformation scene is simply stupid.. rock music, alcohol, a cool pose.. Apocalypse's way of ""convincing"" others into joining him is as bad. He says ""come with me"" and that's it. What does he want? To kill all! Sure, I'll join. 4) Apocalypsis takes Magneto to his conncentration camp (which is intact after who knows how many years) and somehow knows about Magneto's past for some reason. Knows his name, knows how he feels. 5) X-Men insults the Star Wars trilogy, calling the third (Return of the Jedi) as the worst one. Why? 6) Oh yes, Magneto lost everything, again. For some reason, he hasn't learned his lesson, and continues to hang out with women and have children. Then they get killed and he blames everyone! 7) Stan Lee's cameo is.. nothing. Him looking at the sky as a civilian. 8) Somehow, aside from being somewhat telepathic, or so I understood, Apocalypsis can also teleport for some reason. But then he states he needs Xavier's powers! So, which is it? Do you have all powers or don't? If you can do most of what it is shown you can do, why do you need 4 horsemen, or other mutants? 9) Quicksilver's scene, while awesome, is super coincidental. No reason why he should have saved everyone from an exploding mansion. He isn't in super speed 100% of the time! Nor he knows the place is exploding! Yet he walks right to the center of the mansion and sees and rescues everyone. Ugh. 10) So, a ""psychic event"" destroyed all the world's nukes, and Colonel Stryker tracked the source to Xavier's mansion.... suuuuure. 11) Wolverine shows up and kills people, retconing his origin. He then runs in the snow. Fine. There is no real ""Berserker Rage"". Anyway, sucks and unnecessary. 12) Psylocke uses a whip to fight, instead of her psyonich blades. 13) Magneto goes all-out-destructive with little reason.. but wait, he becomes good with even less. 14) Mystique turns into Psylocke and for some reason she has a blade. It was a ""twist"", if you can call it that. This scene, where she attempted to kill Apocalypse is the closes the writer could come close to a surprise situation. 15) Apocalypse turns big, yes, in a mind sequence. Looks bad by the way. Apocalypse does little to no shifting actions. He remains as seen in the pictures. 16) Quicksilver DOESN'T tell Magneto he is his father. The reason? There isn't one.They said Lawrence didn't do much in the movie, that it was the kids that did.. but ultimately, nobody really does anything. The fights are not even 2% of the movie, it's mostly talk (some bad lines, nothing mind bending). Mutants underused, which is the biggest let down. The movie is a lot of nothing! Oh, and the X-men have Sentinels now, for some reason.. Lots of stuff, lots of nothing. Not even a good waste of time."
X-Men: Apocalypse,12-May-16,"I am horrified by the people on the message boards here on this movie's threads. They're fighting each other like a bunch of hungry animals. Since when does everyone started listening to the critics? I mean, yes, to have an idea before watching a movie is good, but that's not the case these days. Critics are taking movies way too seriously these days. It's just a source of entertainment. Your life does not depend on it. Stop bad mouthing this movie for others. Okay, sorry for my rant but this has gotten out of control. Now getting back to the movie, let's just say it delivered what it promised. This movie was amazing. It really felt like you were watching something Apocalyptic. Although I don't have had a problem with Bryan Singer's X Men movies, unlike a bunch of whiny babies, this one actually felt like it was an X Men movie. A sheer resemblance of what we saw in X Men cartoons, both evolution and the 1990 ones. We actually saw the main characters of this movie in their mutant form. I have loved how Bryan always preferred acting over action in his other movies, but this one, it consists of both. I have also seen critics saying that this movie is complete CGI. Well it's not like you can do actual Apocalyptic level scenes without having any CGI effects. That's just crazy. And the CGI in this movie is beyond awesome. I already smell an Oscar for CGI for this movie. Oscar Isaac was so impressive in this movie. Even though he was buried under make up and what not, you could actually feel his performance. Michael and James once again give awesome performances. Expected nothing less from Jennifer Lawrence. At least these movies actually give spotlight to the female actresses *cough* *Marvel* *cough*. The new actors were great. So talented. Tye, Sophie, Alexandra, Kodi and of course Evan Peters were all good in their respective roles. This movie might feel a different because of it's whole world at stake thing. This is the first time X Men has done this, and they succeed really good at it. It had a perfect balance of action, humor, emotion and mutants. It was like watching a live action version of those X Men cartoons we grew up watching. Once again, please dear my friends, who would love to see these guys in MCU, it's not happening anytime soon. Let's just get over it, okay? The producer of these movies has already announced a bunch of new movies under Fox. There are X Men TV shows coming out soon, so let us enjoy these while you guys enjoy yours okay?"
X-Men: Apocalypse,10-May-16,"Overall movie was great Although movie starts a bit slow and i was a little confused and bored but after that the movie finally starts catching up to the expectation.For me this was the best x-men movie because this movie has the best action sequences as compared to any other x-men movie with a great story and emotion(not as good as days of future past but who cares its a superhero movie) .and QUICKSILVER WASSS AWESOMEEEEE .I can literally watch the movie again just because of quicksilver.I never thought they could top the X-Men: Days of Future Past action(or comedy) scene but they did.Acting of all the cast members were awesome and James McAvoy,Michael Fassbender & Jennifer Lawrence knocked it out the park.I don't understand the critics , I never did.(sound's similar to superman's mom in BvS that was in the trailer :P)Movie the great and I can't wait to watch it again."
X-Men: Apocalypse,08-Jun-16,"The first X-Men trilogy was weirdly obsessed with Wolverine, and by extension Rouge. I never understood why... This new trilogy is obsessed with Mystique just because America's sweetheart Jennifer Lawrence is portraying her. I don't mind it, but Mystique is no hero, she is a devious villain! And Beast should be well a Beast, but a handsome Nicholas Hoult is better to look at I presume. Storm is not a villain, she is a beloved X-Men character that has never been done justice. These are things that enrage fans over and over again.It is not about being a purist, but about honoring the original. In an age where superheros are invading our cinemas, one could do worse if one watches a film about hope and freedom, about homophobia, racism, bigotry, immigration and all sort of other social issues. And somehow none of the X-men films so far have successfully brought these themes to the screen.This film suffers from having to focus on thousands of characters and locations. Some characters like Mystique and Magneto are given substantial screen time, while others such as Psylocke are given only a few scenes. The film also tries to fit into the overall X-Men continuity, while trying to stand up on its own.A great film for a pop-corn viewing with your friends, but a sub-par X-Men film in general... It is sad that the most substantial superheroes of our age, that really have something to say about the world we live in, are treated as badly as this...Mutant and proud? Unfortunately there is nothing to be proud of except the money the film is about to make."
X-Men: Apocalypse,07-Jun-16,"Apocalypse who was the first mutant ever, is from the Egyptian days. Awakens in 1983, he is more powerful than ever, and puts together his own band of mutants in hopes of world domination. It's up too Charles Xavier(James McAvoy) and his band of young mutants in hopes of stopping him.The well known characters like Cyclops and Havok and not to mention Beast don't really stand out as much they should. McAvoy is okay as Professor X, but it's Michael Fassbender as Magneto, that really takes the film, showing more Lars to the character, I was really liking his story arch. Jennifer Lawrence is alright here as Mystique. But Oscar Isaac has Apocalypse is creepy but no so much menacing, the animated Apocalypse was way more menacing. The effects are pretty descent, battle scenes enjoyable. I wonder there gonna be any more X-Men films, for me it ends with me not wanting anymore."
X-Men: Apocalypse,17-May-16,"The movie gave everything I expected from it, and more.Action? Check.Drama? Check.Funny moments and scenes? HUGE check. (still laughing when replying in my mind! :))Unlike many who watched the pre-premiere, I'm not a groupie of the X-men series, but still enjoyed each and every minute.Reading other reviews, looks like it's a good thing I'm not a groupie, because that means I don't have to stop and think about every action in the movie. I could just sit back, watch with clear mind, and enjoy.All in all, just fun to watch. 140 minutes that end with a desire for 140 more."
X-Men: Apocalypse,21-May-16,"They ruined all x-men movies you ever seen I saw all X-Men movies, i am fan of X-men, BUT this one was really awful. I can't even know how to describe this crap. Can't believe this movie was 2.5 hours film that was actually got into production. Its an insult of xmen movies. Its a Power Rangers movie not X-Men.First of all, Script is just awful. ""Oh good to see you"" - ""long time, where you'v been"" - and lets hug for 15 minutes and say how good to see each and one of them, like you are watching some kind of TV series like Friends or somethin'.Second: If you want to go and watch x-men crazy fight scene movie, you will end up with super power guys use there super power to mimic the fight at the end of the movie. All fights are 20 minutes + - of almost 3 hour film. Magneto do nothing in this movie, even in final fight scene, he is up in the Air and thats really it. Everything looks cheap plastic, there is a moment that they are on hill and guess what, its like someone make a polish on this hill, its looks so cheap you can't believe it. You fill the Studio...Third: all this movie was like made up for a sake of movie. You wont see a Mystique for a long in this movie, She decide tolook a like a girl (Jennifer Lawrence)... Or The budget for CGI was not enough.Fourth: Logan / Wolverine - Hey ))) he is there for 1 minute. yep that what you will got. 1 awful minute that he is running. He is in this film just for saying that he was there. Nothing added to the film from his appearance. Fifth: i can understand that they want a new crew and remake all this thing, but guys, from good x-men movie, it becomes some superhero mess.It was just unnecessary movie. They ruined all x-men movies you ever seen Storyline is just for kids Channel. Anyway, i just felt so disappointed they just ruined it. thats it."
X-Men: Apocalypse,17-May-16,"X-Men: Apocalypse is absolutely amazing! The early reviewers don't seem to understand these characters and they don't understand this film. It sets a new precedent for comic book films in a world over-saturated with adaptations.The film hits every nostalgic and aesthetic beat it's supposed to without devolving into pure fan service. The writing is great. The allegory the mutant plight is for civil rights is given its due screen time. The characterization of the superheroes goes beyond their powers and outfits and at least touches the heart of who they are as people. Its main fault is juggling so many characters and so some of the acting comes off as stilted at times. In a way this is also its strength, because it manages to tell a coherent and compelling narrative with a large ensemble cast of characters, emulating the source material faithfully. It is a comic book fan's film.The action scenes are epic in scope, with stakes so high you'll be on the edge of your seat with you eyes transfixed on the action, yet never does the pacing sacrifice plot or character development for obligatory spectacle. Everything is purposefully sensational.As someone who was born in the 80s and experienced these characters' evolution through popular culture onto the big screen, I can say that X-Men: Apocalypse brings the flavor of the comics and the 90s TV show to the big screen in a way that children of the 80s and 90s love."
X-Men: Apocalypse,23-May-16,"What the hell is going on..! Let's just be honest..First we were so excited to see the movie then we realized that we just waste our money and time!The Plot is just not well written!The first 20 mints of the movie were good and would raise your hope.. But then you will lose you internist and attention as the events pass by separably and boringly.. Sophie Turner just screw it up with her unauthentic act..Conclusion: Over dramatic,cheesy,very over rated and the plot is very disappointing!"
X-Men: Apocalypse,27-May-16,"Movie was so boring I wanted to walk out of the movie cinema. Usual lets bring bad guy back, find some other bad guys, destroy the world with mind numbing blah. No twists. No nothing. Predictable trash. The first hour was the concept of ""Hi"" ""Hello"" and we are bringing the band back together.Jean Grey(Stark) was miscast. Why was she in this movie? The acting was poor. And of course Ms. Jennifer Lawrence giving me a Hunger games weak speech at the end. Jennifer Lawrence is not even that talented of an actress but Hollywood is trying so hard with her. She hardly does anything in this movie and just says, ""fight"" over and over. Raven didn't even do anything.""Magneto, you're not bad, you're good"" from Prof. X. I'm thinking, ""Yes, I have the point"". I wish Magneto woulda zapped a coin threw my head at this point. The final scene had him floating for a half hour wondering if he should fight. WTF He did nothing. Or and the fantastic four combine their powers to defeat this stargate joke. I do not recommend. Anyone that said they liked it doesn't know anything about quality. I did like the other two xmen before this. Mostly, ""Days of future Past"". This is as disappointing as ""Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull"". If you do decide to see this movie, I already feel sorry for you. Just give me your 10$ and I just saved almost 3 hours of your life. It was bad..."
The Green Mile,02-Dec-09,"i expected this movie to be a normal and i just want to see it for Tom Hanks but as movie goes through i cry,i laugh and there comes a feeling which can't be described in words. i rate this movie as the best i have ever seen. some moments in the movie makes me hold my bed pillow in the tightest ever grip. i can guarantee that this movie will leave an impression in your mind for a long time. i even say that this movie is better than shawshank redemption.fantastic story, brilliant acting,mind boggling feelings and overall an unforgettable drama. if you have watched 1000 movies and not this then your movie watching journey is incomplete.i will also make sure that even my next generation should watch this one."
The Green Mile,15-Dec-99,"""The Green Mile"" is one of my favorite Stephen King books and I have read it several times.  I was anxiously anticipating the film version, but was concerned that the emotional impact of the book could not be replicated on screen.  Fortunately this wonderful story was adapted by Frank Darabont, who did such a magnificent job bringing King's ""Shawshank Redemption"" to the screen.  He does the same high quality work with ""The Green Mile"".  The story is faithful to the book, only losing details that were not important to the story anyway.  The casting is superb - every actor is perfectly suited for his role and does an excellent job, although I would like to single out Doug Hutchison.  His portrayal of the detestable Percy is right on the mark and suggests complexities in this character I had not discovered in the book.  The length is about three hours and it seems that critics are complaining about that.  I can't understand the complaints.  The film never drags and is never dull, and it certainly didn't feel three hours long.  The length is needed to tell this story the way it should be told, and the story is so very engrossing.  Best of all, Darabont and the actors bring so much emotion ot the screen, that I cried like a baby through several scenes. ""The Green Mile"" will haunt you."
The Green Mile,09-Jan-00,"The Green Mile is a masterwork. This is film as art, at it's very best. The depth of the cast is extraordinary, with all of the players delivering excellent performances. There is a clear sense here that all involved in the production knew that this was something special, and gave it their all. See this film if you truly enjoy actors giving everything to their craft. Watch for the countless subtleties of expression, and the great power that the cast creates with silence. This is evident in the opening sequence and remains throughout. Above all, Michael Duncan as John Coffey is exceptional. He brings gripping emotion to a unique, fascinating character.The Green Mile should bring you joy, laughter, and if you are like most in the theater this night, tears.BRAVO!"
The Green Mile,15-Dec-99,"Having seen the movie, The Green Mile, and read the novel of the same  name by Stephen King, I am glad to say that the movie stays true to the  book, which in itself is a great read.  I read the book in one setting about a year ago, and after seeing the  movie, I didn't see one scene from the book, or one plot point, left  out. There were a few minor changes from the book but which in no way  detract from either work.  As far as performances, I can imagine many people pointing to Michael  Duncan as John Coffey or Tom Hanks as Paul Edgecomb as the best  performances of the movie, and they are good, but I would hope that  Michael Jeter would receive recognition for portraying Eduard  Delacroix. He plays Delacroix exactly as I pictured him when I read the  book.  I can very well see why King himself said this is his favorite of the  movies adapted from his novels. It is the only one played out as he had  written it.  I wouldn't compare this movie or the book to (Rita Hayworth and) The  Shawshank Redemption because that would be unfair to both. They are  both great, but are both different. The Green Mile isn't a movie about  hope and friendship, as The Shawshank Redemption was, it is a movie  about a miracle of a man, and the people he affects.  But like The Shawshank Redemption, I give The Green Mile 4 out of 4  stars. Great story, great cast, great look."
The Green Mile,10-Feb-00,"Frank Darabont returns to the directors chair with another adaptation of Stephen Kings novel. The events take place at a death row, the guards call the green mile. The story is a layered, rather character-driven fantasy tale of the events that transpire at ""the mile"" after the arrival of a giant man, John Coffey (Michael Duncan), convicted of the murder of two small girls. Actually this is not one single story, but several tied together seamlessly.A character-driven movie requires a lot from the cast, and fortunately when it comes to cast, The Green Mile delivers. As the poster of the movie tells, this movie stars Tom Hanks as Paul Edgecomb, senior prison guard of the mile, and as always he performs very well indeed. Yet the cast around him is even more spectacular, perhaps partially due to them being relatively unknown. With a face you know, one inevitably remembers previous performances, and the new role is coloured by this.  Doug Hutchison as Percy Wetmore, a mean spirited prison guard was particularly impressive, yet his character could have been given more depth. The most captivating was the performance of Michael Duncan.It is hard to find a flaw in this movie. The camerawork is superb, cast wonderful and direction flawless. The movie's considerable length, a bit over three hours, is something that had me worried. Yet the marvellous cast and the peaceful yet firm pace of the movie held my attention progressively through the three hours right to the touching culmination. Many will find this movie to be too long, but I for one was delighted of the style, combination of simplicity of events and depth of characters and conversation.All in all the The Green Mile is a very touching drama, with the joys and sorrows of the life pictured with great skill, if not the best movie of the year. Five out of five."
The Green Mile,05-Sep-12,"There's a reason why this Oscar winning tour de force is #67 ranked of all films on IMDb, despite the fact that it's 3 hours long and has some truly grisly scenes (not for the squeamish, children, or a first date.)It's chock full of outstanding performances, not only from Hanks, but also from the many supporting characters, all who are rich and full. It will seem slow to the impatient, but will be richly rewarding for those with the stamina to make it to the end. It will certainly get you thinking about capital punishment and perhaps different shades/degrees of evil. It is either a deeply moving spiritual tale or a wonderfully creepy journey down the rabbit hole of Stephen King's mind; take your pick. Either way, I put it right up there on my desert island list with the likes of Shawshank Redemption. It is definitely required watching."
The Green Mile,24-Feb-20,"Some of the supporting characters are a little two-dimensional, but 'The Green Mile' is an incredibly effective prison drama with terrific performances and a script that deals with grief in an innovative and emotionally resonant way."
The Green Mile,25-Jan-00,"THE GREEN MILE (1999) ****Starring: Tom Hanks, David Morse, Michael Clarke Duncan, Bonnie Hunt, James Cromwell, Michael Jeter, Doug Hutchison, and Gary Sinise Written and directed by Frank Darabont. Running Time: 180 minutes. Rated R (for scenes of strong disturbing violence, language, and some sexuality)
By Blake French:	It's not everyday that a movie is able to change an audiences opinion on something. ""The Green Mile"" is a movie that made me think long and hard about supporting the death penalty. The film, based on a novel by  Stephen King, contains such a variety of emotional events that it repels its audience away from its subject rather than glamorizing it. Only a handful of recent productions have been capable of such power. ""The Green Mile"" is truly one of the best films this year and is Oscar Worthy in many categories. It is a unique, three hour experience that must be seen to believe.  The story is more of a personal narrative than an actual plot. The film offers an interesting perspective of the events that take place. It is seen through the eyes of a man who is over one hundred years of age, Paul Edgecomb, who is currently living in an old folks home with his friend, Elaine. During a very emotional day for Paul, he tells Elaine of a historical year in his experiences. She listens closely to his story.He tells of a particular year in the 1930's. The setting is a beautifully crafted prison hall. Paul explains he used to be a kind prison guard on death row in charge of overseeing the executions. In this year, several significant activities occurred in his life: he had a terribly painful urinary infection, and met a prisoner named John Coffey. This man has been sentenced to the electric chair for the rape and murder of two innocent little girls. This man isn't like anyone else Paul has seen, however. Aside from being massive in size, he is humble, mild mannered, and caring. After several miraculous events take place that may point to the thought that John Coffey might have magical powers from God, Paul begins to doubt the crimes this so called criminal has been convicted of. 	Throughout the story we witness three executions that in an electric chair. These capital punishment sequences have much power and significance. The electrocutions, one in particular, contain some of the most unsettling, disturbing material in film history. The movie is anti death penalty; we see the sometimes sadistic world from the prisoner guards point of view. It will put you in their shoes--and perhaps, change your opinion on the death penalty. I certainly had to think about my stand on this issue.
I did have questions that were not really answered by the filmmakers. I wanted more on John Coffey's magical powers; the miracles aren't investigated enough to suit our pleas. I think the movie could have also stood on a firmer platform of religion. We assume that Coffey's abilities are a gift from God from the character's dialogue, but religion itself is more of a theme in the film than a message or plot point. I can perfectly see why the writers decided to leave these elements to the audiences imagination, to provoke participation. So I suppose my objections are not really flaws, just personal aspirations.""The Green Mile"" contains so many vivid performances, I will not be able to honor everyone who deserves credit in my review. Michael Jeter, Gary Sinise, Doug Hutchison, James Cromwell, Bonnie Hunt, and David Morse are all superior in strength of their characters. Each contributes Oscar worthy performances, and if the Academy leaves these individuals out at Award time, they need to recheck their databases. Michael Clarke Duncan recently received a Golden Globe nomination for his supporting role, and he deserves it. Tom Hanks is just unspeakably brilliant in the leading role. He is right behind Kevin Spacey from ""American Beauty"" in the best performance of 1999. 
The message to ""The Green Mile"" is clear and understandable: justice isn't always just and the miracles can happen in the most unexpected of places. This film is one of the most penetrating dramas of the past several years. It will induce your mind to think about its subjects, and gradually build on you. ""The Green Mile"" is a movie that will stick with you long after the ending credits role by. Brought to you by Warner Bros."
The Green Mile,31-Jan-00,"The length of the movie was perfect. It kept to the story to an amazing degree. The few changes didn't hurt the feeling nor the telling. The story itself is stirring and captivating. The casting of the parts and their portrayal were right on. This is one of the best movie versions of a Steven King novel I've ever seen, and I think I've seen them all. If you're prone to tears at a film, take extra tissues, you'll need them. The theater I was in was a mass of sniffles through the end credits. If you like fantasy/drama the film cannot be missed. There are some graphic scenes that may upset some, but this is Steven King. This is a movie I plan to add to my video collection as soon as the Letter Box version hits the shelves."
The Green Mile,17-Jun-01,"This movie is a real gem.  It is hard to find fault with it.  Hanks is excellent in a role that clearly calls for him to suppress his natural slant toward humor.  He is Paul Edgecomb; Tom Hanks is nowhere to be found.  Yet he gives Edgecomb just the right flavor.  One cannot find a single weak cast member!  Michael Jeter should have got an Oscar.  Michael Clark Duncan put just the right shading on his huge character to make him vulnerable and sympathetic.Flawlessly shot on perfect period sets, the whole production binds together to bring the extraordinary story into the realm of a believable and compelling study of human injustice and charity."
The Green Mile,17-Jan-00,"Without using all the old cliches, I would recommend this movie to anyone interested in a creative, intriguing, and life enhancing experience. Everything about this movie was delightful. I recommend seeing this movie with someone especially close to you. After the movie my Fiancée and I spent two hours talking and expanding on the films ideas and concepts. This was truly a electrifying experience. I would venture to call this movie one of the best movies of all time.  Sure, there are things that I would have liked to see done differently, but that is what makes a movie more enjoyable. The discussions following this film were wonderful."
The Green Mile,11-Dec-99,"I went looking for an experience. Something that would take me to the limits of my own existence and remind me that even in the darkest corner of my own life, there was hope. I was reminded, instead that along with the triumph there must also be sacrifice. A part of me died in that theater, but I walked out feeling renewed, refreshed...and a little cursed.I think Paul Edgecomb feels the same way.Tom Hanks has to be the epitome of a Hollywood living legend...and the guy's only in his 40s. He went from scraping his way through sophomoric slap like The 'Burbs, Turner & Hooch, and Bachelor Party to rise up in the 90s as our towering ""everyman.""  Anyone who marvels in his ""simple guy in complicated circumstances"" roles such as Forrest Gump and Saving Private Ryan knows that he can deliver the goods...and an Oscar nomination (or win...or two...in aROW!!!)  But Tom does something very interesting in The Green Mile.  He lays back.The breakout performance in this film goes to Michael Clark Duncan (right now tied with Sixth Sense's Haley Joel Osment for my Best Supporting Actor vote).  Crippled by his size, Mr. Duncan has a limit of the roles he can play. However, given the role of a child-like behemoth with Christ-like powers of healing, Duncan brings to the screen a performance that will transcend the Denzels and the Poitiers of the world.The Green Mile is Cell Block E in a Louisiana State Prison, death row. Paul Edgecomb run this wing with compassion, a startlingly different approach considering the legendary cruelty of southern prisons.  He is surrounded by men in him employ who all share his philosophy that these men ultimately await the most devastating punishment.  Why make their stay any more troubling.All save one: Percy Wetmore (Doug Hutchinson), relative of the Governor and always ready to remind anyone who disagrees his HIS methods just who got him his job. Percy hates everything about The Green Mile; the prisoners, other guards, even a tiny, brave mouse who befriends one of the inmates (Michael Jeter).  It isn't until another new inmate is processed, a man they call ""Wild Bill"", that Percy will meet his equal.So where is the common thread? What is a messianic character doing on death row? What role will Tom Hanks play in his redemption? And what's this ""curse"" thing I brought up in the beginning of this review?If I could tell you, you wouldn't slap the money down on the box office and find it for yourself.  Let me just tell you that the final blessings bestowed by John Coffey (Duncan) could make optimists and pessimists alike find a common ground. How you perceive the final moments will be up to how you impart on yourself...and the world.If John Coffey guilty of his crime?  Are the fates of the characters in this film deserved?  Half and half.  Evil is punished, bu t goodness must bare witness...and that has a price as well.  Will Tom Hanks win another Academy Award?  He shouldn't.  Is this a good film?  No.  It's an incredible film.I still weep for Paul Edgecomb."
The Green Mile,08-Jan-12,"GREATEST FILM I HAVE EVER SEEN. i remember seeing it when it first came out when i was 12 years old. now i just finished watching it and have gone through practically a whole box of tissues...that pure, love and honesty was portrayed so exquisitely well by Michael Clarke Duncan... it made me want to tear my hair out. If there is anything in this world which reminds me of true human love and compassion, it is this film. If you ever give up hope on humanity and the destruction which our disgusting race has brought to this world, watch ""The Green Mile"" Hopefully it will change your outlook a little bit like it just has mine.11/10 SHOULD HAVE WON ALL THE AWARDS AVAILABLE THE YEAR OF IT'S RELEASE."
The Green Mile,14-Nov-10,"This movie goes beyond others into an elite group with movies like Facing The Giants, Good Will Hunting, Men Of Honor and others; in which the story is so brilliant and takes you to a climax higher than the usual, that it baffles you to think that there exist possibility in the human mind to create such a story. Kind of like songs, in which there are songs so brilliantly written that you can't imagine a human being writing it.I love drama, they're my favorites and I don't get bored with them especially when it's interesting; so the length, which is something complained about by a lot of people with this movie, doesn't bother me at all it just adds more interest.One of the best movies of all time and a must see! 10/10 without a doubt."
The Green Mile,11-Jul-13,"The Shawshank Redemption is possibly my favorite movie ever. I had seen many movies before it, and I've certainly seen a lot after, but not many of them made me feel what that one did. Now, I have that feeling again. And once again, it comes from watching a Frank Darabont movie. I couldn't possibly explain the overload of emotions I experienced in the 3 hours it lasts. I have laughed. I have felt the emotions of every character. And most of all, I have cried. Very few movies have touched me like this one. Is there something to say about the acting that hasn't been said before? No, it isn't. You may have heard it is flawless, incredible, whatever. You did hear right, it absolutely is. I can't think of anyone in the whole movie that wasn't convincing in the least. The script has its funny moments, but it's incredibly deep, poignant and heartfelt. The characters are so ""human"" and unpretentious you can't help but adore them. But, well, there will be some you'd like to strangle. There has to be a villain everywhere, right? The Green Mile is a movie I will hardly forget. You can't possibly forget such an emotive story.What, you want to watch it? Great! But don't forget to have grab some tissues first."
The Green Mile,10-Oct-01,"Having doubts about seeing this movie because of the length (3 hours can be death to a film).I was so surprised that I didn't look at my watch once throughout the whole movie. Tom Hanks, in my opinion, gave the performance of his career by bringing emotion and depth to his part. The only actor that bettered him was Michael Clarke Duncan. How he made this giant like character into a vulnerable pussycat was a marvel. On whole, the cast came together and gave the best performance I have seen in a movie for a long time. Not one of them let the side down by being weak. David Morse who is more known for his supporting roles was also excellent and hopefully not long till he's carrying his own movie. If you haven't seen this get it out now,forget about the running time and connections to 'The Shawshank Redemption' and enjoy it for what it is, a little miracle. 4 out of 5"
The Green Mile,29-Oct-09,"The world is teeming with wretched prisons wherein all manner of men are housed. Because these men are said to have committed a crime, the places are manifest and most men serving there, have earned their stay. However, as history has shown, there are innocent men incarcerated as well. Occasionally, one of these innocents are not only imprisoned, but are further remembered because their life becomes legend. In this case, the realization is nothing short of incredible as the new prisoner is a natural empath. Steven King the prolific American horror writer, chronicles this unusual story in a Louisanna prison where one Joe Coffee, (Michael Clarke Duncan) a huge, nay, enormous Black man, having been convicted of murder, is sentenced to be executed, by electrocution. Tom Hanks( And Dabbs Greer) plays Paul Edgecomb, an aging Prison Guard, who recalls his years in the state prison. Working on 'Death Row' or "" The Green Mile "", Mr. Edgecomb recalls Mr. Coffee's arrival and the strange events during his stay. With sympathetic Guards, like Brutus Howell (David Morse), Dean Stanton (Barry Pepper), Harry Terwilliger (Jeffery Demunn and one particular sadistic guard called Percy Wetmore (Doug Hutchison), Edgecomb recollects his discovery of the man's unusual healing powers and the surprising revelations concerning his innocence. The story is crafted by Steven King and it's application to the silver screen is perhaps one of the finest adaptation ever done. Duncan is magnificent and has a superb ability to allow the audience to learn his true purpose. Were it not for the sadistic behavior of Hutchison, who earned his ultimate reward, the story would not have carried it's genuine sympathetic awe which gave this movie it's Classic status. A great film and a must for true movie fans. ****"
The Green Mile,16-Jun-00,"This movie was spectacular!!  I was watching it intently from beginning to end and did not even notice the time.  This movie is a true masterpiece. Tom Hanks and Michael Clarke Duncan were wonderful and the supporting cast was fantastic.Based on a serial novel by Stephen King, the Green Mile is about Paul Edgecomb, a officer in charge of prisoners on death row and everything was the same as usual until the day that John Coffey (Clarke Duncan) was brought to the mile.  Coffey is an extraordinary person and Paul Edgecomb never believed in miracles until the day he met one.  This movie is one of the best adaptations of a Stephen King novel that I have ever seen.  I think that I would recommend this movie to everyone, and even if you don't like King's work I am certain that you will love this flick.  This movie was robbed at the Academy Awards, but never the less, it is still one of the most memorable movies I have ever seen.  A small warning though, if you are a bit squeemish then you may need to hide your eyes for a few scenes, but don't miss out on this movie because of it.  I give this movie a 9.5 out of 10!!!"
The Green Mile,14-Jun-11,"In every way, this is a wonderful film and IMO deserves a rare 10/10 because it's hard personally for me to see how it could have been made any better. Hugely touching, emotive on every human level, a brilliant storyline, by all accounts a faithful screenplay and wonderfully cast. It's long, but the time flies.Hanks is superb here as is the inspired choice of Michael Clarke Duncan and in fact all of the cast. Even the mouse was brilliant!SPOILERS:It's the story of a simple man wrongly convicted of the worst type of crime. Set in a time where there is no real recourse to justice for such men and with a subplot that becomes the main focus of the film. Is John Coffey a gift from God and if so why are we allowing him to be legally murdered? That he ultimately doesn't mind, doesn't ease Paul's pain or the viewers pain at what we are watchingBoth Bitterbuck and Delacroix will make you question the death penaltyPercy's grossly offensive behaviour will make you question your humanity Paul Edgecomb will make you realise what a fantastically emotive actor Tom Hanks is and Duncan's John Coffey will make you weepHats off to you Mr Darabont once again and thank you for a truly beautiful film."
The Green Mile,04-Jan-19,One of the best movies I've ever seen. 3 hours that keep you attached to the screen. It's one of those movies that whenever I see it will not bother me
The Green Mile,09-Nov-18,"Personaly iam that kind of guy who doesn't tear on atouching scene or anything like that,but in this movie i cryied like a baby ,it was a masterpiece,you will never see somthing like this in your life again"
The Green Mile,10-Feb-00,"What an excellent movie this picture was. When I first saw the trailers in October, I thought it might be pretty good.The Green Mile exceeded my expectations. Tom Hanks leads a wonderful cast in this movie which stands out by far from most others. If you liked Shawshank Redemption, you'll love this one.  I've realized just how good Stephen King can write, now that I've seen this and Shawshank.  It's three hours long, and worth every minute of it.  It touched me in many ways.  I was fortunate enough to see it twice. And I will buy it on dvd as soon as it is available. The Green Mile will certainly become a classic. Go see it, you won't be disappointed."
The Green Mile,06-May-11,This is easily one of my favourite movies of all time. do not be put off of watching this movie because of its run time(3 hours) because those 3 hours will just fly by as this movie is so interesting and such a huge success. tom hanks is the main character but i think that Micheal Clarke Duncan really does steal the spotlight away from him. Stephen kings novel (with the same title) is not as good as the movie but it still stands tall i would recommend viewing this little gem if you're a fan of tom hanks or Stephen king.i have never watched a movie that has made me cry but i have to say i was very close to tears after the undeniable ending.the script is just outstanding and the acting is spot on.the storyline is very original as i have never seen anything like this before and i don't think anyone will ever try to copy it.if you're thinking about viewing this title and you haven't seen it already i suggest you get the tissues ready.
The Green Mile,22-Oct-18,"This movie was so well done, always enjoy watching it."
The Green Mile,16-Feb-13,"Until I saw 'the Green Mile', I always thought that the 'Shawshank Redemption' and 'Forrest Gump' were the two saddest movies that I ever saw, but this movie actually blew me away for good.'The Green Mile' tells the tale of a few prison officers whose life changes when a supposed rapist/murderer gets sent to the prison they are in. During this time, they come to realize that he has a mysterious power that can be used for good and that the man may truly be innocent of all accused crimes.I love every single thing about 'the Green Mile', the same way I loved everything about 'The Shawshank Redemption' and 'Forrest Gump'. The acting in the movie was just perfected on all corners. Tom Hanks brilliantly portrays the complex character of Paul Edgecomb and the late Michael Clarke Duncan absolutely steals the show in an Oscar robbed performance as John Coffey. May he ever rest in peace. It wasn't, however, just those two who gave strong performances. The actors playing Brutus, Hal, Del, Percy, Wharton all did an unbelievable job at portraying how realistic prison life may truly be.The story is so emotionally moving that it is impossible to not like and connect with. The characters presented in the movie are some of the finest movie characters that I've ever seen. This film truly mastered characters and what they undergo during prison life.The directing and writing by Frank Darabont, the man behind 'The Shawshank Redemption' absolutely masters everything a film needs to get right once more and adds such layers to each character that we come to truly love by the end of the film.The tone to the movie is so dark that we are immediately thrown into the world presented in this movie. The movie is so sad on many occasions that I was truly left bawling my eyes out.**Spoilers*** The scene where Del is horribly executed to death was just too sad to look at. This movie made me sympathize with criminals more than any other movie.The last half hour made me truly cry all the way through it. The film doesn't attempt to out do itself and just masters it all. The ending to the movie just continued to make me cry.John Coffey's death is perhaps, the saddest death I've ever seen in movie history. It was such a moving scene that truly made me think twice about life.***Spoilers ended*** 'The Green Mile' is a superbly acted, directed, written movie with fascinating characters and a moving story that is sure to make everyone cry and be totally glad that they saw this movie. I however, do not think I will ever sit through this 3 hour movie, as I cannot bear to be emotionally connected to these characters. Watching 'The Green Mile' again and again is not easy, but that's a good thing about the movie."
Avengers: Infinity War,23-Feb-20,"This movie portrays a villain that by far has been the best out of all the other Marvel antagonists. It shows his personal conflicts, his purpose, as well as his cruelty. The heroes of this film are overshadowed by this, but the ending really makes a mark on the audience."
Avengers: Infinity War,02-Sep-19,"This film is way better than endgame!
The actions better
The writings better
The dialogues better
The cgi is better
More shocks and more emotional.
Watching both in the cinema , the reactions to this in cinema was unbelievable compared to endgame. Dont get me wrong endgame is good but to say its the best marvel film is jus marvel fan boys being stupid.
I just dont see how people are saying endgame is the best marvel film when theres clearly other marvel films better than it!
But trust me this is the film that changed the mcu , lol maybe it because i wanted them to lose because thanos is badass!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Avengers: Infinity War,14-Aug-18,"This movie is the beginning of the culmination of Marvel's masterfully woven cinematic universe. Beginning back in 2008 with iron man, we are finally seeing the results of all the movies have been pointing to; and it did not disappoint. Thanos is a complex villain, with deeper and more interesting desires than just ""world domination."" The dilemmas all the characters face in this movie (both the heroes and the villains) are truly thought provoking and leave you on the edge of your seat. No other set of movies has beeen so involved, so expanded, and encompassed so many story lines/characters and previous movies. The sheer amount of star power alone in this film is insane; and they do a masterful job of weaving all these unique and various characters into a common storyline."
Avengers: Infinity War,26-Apr-18,"I consider myself a big comic book marvel fan. My favorite films from the franchise so far, are Cap. American: Winter Soldier and Thor: Ragnarok. As this movie was directed by the same guys as Winter Soldier and Civil War, I went into this movie with sky-high expectations. I am gonna keep this brief: Avengers: Infinity War blew me away! If I should mention just one thing that really amazed me was the character of Thanos. He is so well developed and makes for a super interesting and complex villain. As an audience, we are actually capable of sympathizing with a guy, who wants to kill off half of the universe. It's not about power or dominance. It's about preserving life in a Universe with finite resources - a goal with leads him (and the avengers) into several interesting moral dilemmas. I agree with the other reviews here. This movie is such a beautiful calamity of 10 years of the best superhero entertainment there is. Thinking about it, I can't really grasp how the director pulled this off. So many well developed characters from different story lines are working together in a true cinematic symphony. I give this movie my highest recommendations. It's a must-see for anyone with just a remote interest in the franchise."
Avengers: Infinity War,25-Apr-18,"Over the past decade, Marvel has earned itself the benefit of the doubt. The studio has consistently delivered smart, funny, brave films that both embrace and transcend their comic-book origins. The 18 blockbuster movies produced since Iron Man first blasted off into the stratosphere in 2008 have not only reinvented superhero films as a genre - they've helped to legitimise it. Indeed, Marvel's two most recent films - Thor: Ragnarok and Black Panther - have received the kind of accolades usually reserved for edgy arthouse flicks. And yet, it's perfectly reasonable to be apprehensive about Avengers: Infinity War. This is a blockbuster film that's been ten years in the making, its plot hinted at and scattered throughout 18 other movies. It features 30 or so characters, each with their own complex backstories and motivations. And all of them are coming together in a bid to stop a giant purple alien dude from destroying the universe. It sounds ridiculous, and feels impossible. But that's precisely what makes the final product such a monumental achievement. Masterfully directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, Infinity War is bold, brainy filmmaking at its very best: the kind that will lift your spirits, blow your mind and shatter your soul - occasionally in the same scene. It demonstrates on an epic scale what Marvel has known all along: that special effects and tightly choreographed action are there to serve the story. For all its blockbuster spectacle (and there's almost too much of that), the film works because it's anchored by the heart, humour and humanity of its characters.The film's basic plot is simple: Thanos (played via motion-capture by Josh Brolin), intergalactic purveyor of death and destruction, has long been on the hunt for the six Infinity Stones that will give him complete control over the elemental building blocks of the universe. He dispatches his acolytes to Earth to retrieve the Time Stone, currently in the possession of Dr. Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), and carve the Mind Stone out of the forehead of Vision (Paul Bettany). It's a literal existential threat so terrifying that all the heroes we've come to know and love - from the Avengers to the Guardians of the Galaxy - must put aside their differences and unite against a common foe. From the outset, it's immediately clear that neither the film's directors nor screenwriters (Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely) are interested in playing it safe. Most other superhero films are bled of high stakes - the hero in the title might suffer untold trauma, but it's a super-safe bet that he or she will make it to the end alive. There's no such guarantee here. Within the first ten minutes, we are confronted with the dark, twisted depths to which Thanos and his acolytes in the Black Order will sink in order to achieve their goals. Death, as well as genuine loss and sacrifice, is intrinsic to the narrative drumbeat that drives Infinity War ever forward, and the film is all the better for it. That's not to say the movie is a morbid and depressing experience. What's so impressive about Infinity War is how it expertly juggles its constantly shifting tones and moods. When it's funny (and it very often is), it's deeply, truly funny. The film finds maximum joy in flinging characters together with merry abandon, mixing and matching ones you'd never have expected to share scenes or trade banter. Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) is floored by Thor's (Chris Hemsworth) godly muscles. Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) is charmed by the wit and intelligence of Shuri (Letitia Wright). And it'd be impossible to not be utterly delighted by Peter Dinklage's inspired cameo. It's a blithely tongue-in-cheek sensibility shared by Marvel's best comic books, which understand that humour can make you care when it really counts.And, boy, does Infinity War make it count. There are many heartbreakingly human moments threaded throughout the film: from the charming surrogate father-son dynamic shared by Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) and Peter Parker (Tom Holland), to the undeniable love that ties Vision and Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) together. In many ways, the film stands as a testament to the human capacity not just to love, but to love fiercely and beyond all logic. It's right there when the unfailingly noble Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) declares, ""We don't trade lives"", even when giving up one could save billions. There's even a chilling echo of it in Thanos himself. A lesser film would have turned Thanos into a one-dimensional villain, much the way he's all monster and maniac in the comic books. In Infinity War, however, Thanos' end goal is surprisingly relevant when it comes to thinking and talking about the staggeringly overpopulated world in which we live today. There is, as it turns out, method to Thanos' madness. It makes the tragic twists and turns in his relationships with his estranged adopted daughters, Gamora (Zoe Saldana) and Nebula (Karen Gillan), all the more unsettling. For the most part, Infinity War does justice, too, to the many heroes who have been assembled for the film. The Russo brothers displayed great skill at interweaving multiple perspectives and character trajectories in Captain America: Civil War, and they do so again here, with twice as many characters. Even the most minor of supporting players, like Don Cheadle's James Rhodes/War Machine, are given story beats that land. It helps that Marvel has always taken care to cast genuinely good actors in roles that might otherwise come off as silly and slight. Even so, there are a few standouts amongst this enormous and enormously talented cast. Emotionally speaking, this is Downey's film. He plays every note of Tony's reluctant courage and bone-deep trauma, as he embarks on what he's convinced is a suicide mission. He's ably matched by Cumberbatch, who finds vulnerability even in his character's most cunning and calculative move. Hemsworth, meanwhile, is given free rein to import the big-hearted comedic swagger of Thor: Ragnarok into this film - while also layering it with a deeply-felt, jagged grief for the losses he has suffered at the hands of Thanos and the universe.In a film with so many moving parts, some elements don't work quite as well. A couple of characters that you might have expected to be right at the forefront - including an original Avenger or two - fade into the background. The film tumbles from dizzying fight scene to dizzying fight scene, and while most of them are fantastically choreographed, there are some purely dumb moments that literally revolve around attempts to prevent Thanos from clenching his fist. In effect, this is a superhero mêlée that's part over-the-top and part overkill, and might prove too much for those who don't already care for this franchise and the characters in it.Minor quibbles aside, though, Infinity War is yet another step in the right direction for Marvel. It continues the studio's tradition of placing a premium on rich, complex storytelling that respects both its characters and its audiences. But it also refuses to make things easy for itself. The film ends even more bravely than it began, with a final ten minutes that will haunt and horrify you in equal measure. It's a stroke of bold, brilliant genius - a narrative risk so audacious that you'll want to follow Marvel wherever it goes next."
Avengers: Infinity War,24-Apr-18,"Summer movies often hype themselves as spectacular events not to be missed and their ad campaigns use words like ""epic"", ""spectacle"", and ""smash"" as ways to build the hype to increase advanced box office sales.
The summer 2018 film season kicks off in a big way with ""Avengers: Infinity War"" and it is the rare summer film that exceeds is lofty expectations and delivers a crowning achievement for the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
When Thanos (Josh Brolin), embarks on a deadly campaign to find and possess the Infinity Stones, he leaves a path of death and destruction in his path. When his pursuit leading him to Earth, Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo), and Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), who enlist a reluctant Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), to the cause just as the minions of Thanos arrive.
With The Avengers fractured and scattered following the events of ""Captain America: Civil War"" the teams find themselves dealing with the threat in various groups as fate steps in to divide many key members of the team. This allows for a great entry by the Guardians of the Galaxy and allows the film to take a very enjoyable path. Essentially the movie weaves separate storylines into one cohesive and very satisfying epic. You have a story with the Guardians as well as one with many of the key Avengers, as well as others with characters old and new. As such it is like a Guardians, Avengers, and Marvel film all rolled into one and each one supports the other very well yet has the charm and identity you would expect. While the tone is very dark as you would expect with literally half of the known universe facing destruction, there is also some solid humor in the film that never once undermines the story or pacing.
Naturally the effects are stunning as you would expect as Marvel has put a significant amount of money into the film and it shows in every eye-popping action sequence.
What really impressed me the most was that the Russo Brothers never let the FX of the film overshadow the characters and with a very large cast, it was nice to see everyone got their moment and you did not see members of the cast trying to one up each other.
There are some real surprise moments along the way and the action is easily the best of any Marvel film to date. Many fans had expressed disappointment with ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" for me this film is significantly better than the prior film and is everything that a Marvel fan would want in a film.
I was also surprised by how well Thanos was portrayed as while you hopefully will not agree with his deductions and methods; you could actually understand his motivations and it help him transcend from the usual megalomaniacs which are so common in films of his type. I am really looking forward to seeing what comes next and make sure you stay through the credits for a bonus scene.
Believe the hype, ""Avengers: Infinity War"" is an epic not to be missed and is an example of what a summer event film should be.
5 stars out of 5"
Avengers: Infinity War,19-Jun-18,"I was amazed to see so many negative reviews; so many people are impossible to please. This movie was 2 1/2 hours long, but I could have sat there another 2 1/2 hours and not noticed. Thoroughly entertaining, and I love how the directors weren't afraid to take chances. I've read a lot of other user reviews that claim that there's no plot. Unless you're mentally handicapped or not paying attention because you're on your phone the entire movie, the plot is pretty clear, and decent in my opinion."
Avengers: Infinity War,12-Jun-18,"Infinity War does a brilliant job by seamlessly combining the last few films together. It picks up where Ragnarok left off on the space shuttle with Thor, Loki, Hulk and all the remaining Asgardians. It opens with a distress call as Thanos and his Dark Order have slaughtered most of passengers including some of the remaining Asgardians. He interrogates Thor and beats Hulk so bad he is too scared to ever turn green again. A defeated Hulk/Bruce Banner is then transported to Doctor Strange's Sanctum Sanctorum so he can warn him of Thanos' arrival. It is down to Doctor Strange, Wong, Tony Stark and Spider Man to prevent Thanos' evil minions from destroying New York and taking the time stone. It's a thrilling action sequence that introduces Starks cool new nano-bot armour that creates its own swords and shields. Thanos has been teased since 2012 and the wait has paid off here as he is by far one of the best villains. The story is more about him achieving his goals which is refreshing to see as the villains are normally sidelined in these films. He is so determined to get all six gems, each gem making him stronger. The Avengers and Guardians have to race against time to stop him from finding all six. One sequence on his home planet 'Titan' is worth mentioning and like most of the film, it is breathtaking and tense. His crew (Dark Order) also seem unbeatable as they battle the rest of the Avengers in Wakanda with their alien army which also proves difficult. Thanos gets some interesting backstory, it would have been even better if the menacing Dark Order got some backstory themselves as we never really understand them or their motivations.Even though it enters familiar ground, it is often done differently and most of the time it's unpredictable. It's full of surprises and twists which will leave you exhausted by the end. Although Infinity War feels over stuffed with characters and storylines, the Russo Brothers do an exceptional job by giving each character enough to do. Its great to see some focus on characters like Gamora and Thor as previous films have kept it prominently on characters Iron Man, Hulk and Captain America. That's not to say they don't get anything to do because they do, it's just not as much as usual. This entry really does require you to see all of the ones before it as it can become confusing. They often call back to previous events and storylines, so it's a better experience if you are familiar with all of them. There are also so many fun references like Rocket Racoon's need for artificial limbs, Thor's new haircut and Drax's constant quips. There are too many visual effects shots which could have been avoided using practical effects. The CGI shots don't look bad, but sometimes they can be distracting. However it's a technique that is quicker than any other, and with studio films of this scale that's just a small price to pay. The action scenes are so well directed accompanied by a music score by Alan Silvestri who always adds that extra level of excitement to them. It is a relief to say Infinity War runs well over 2 hours 30 minutes which is the longest Marvel film. There is no point saying its ""baggy"" or ""overlong"" as fans of the franchise will greatly appreciate this and with so much going on the runtime is justified."
Avengers: Infinity War,27-Apr-18,"All the reviews that say this movie has no plot are either trolls, idiots, or didn't are to take the time to watch previous marvel movies. Every single one of those ratings and reviews should be taken down and not added to the rating for Infinity War because of their fundamental lack of understanding. It's like coming in and watching the last 2 minutes of an hour long drama show and saying this episode sucks because it has no plot. It's utterly ridiculous!There have been 31 marvel movies leading up to this point. All 31 has have some plot that leads to infinity war. Infinity War IS the end game movie. There is nothing left to explain, nothing left to discuss, it is all-out fight for control of the most powerful items in existence, the infinity stones. There have been 31 movies to explain in someway the power of these stones and/or the heroes that come together to fight Thanos in this movie. It's like a long game of chess where Thanos finally makes his move, and it's a huge one.So I beg of any of you who reads this. Don't listen to anyone who says this movie has no plot, has no reason and is only fighting. They aren't worth listening to, Infinity Wars has roughly 60 hours of plot from 31 precious movies leading up to this monumental fight for life or death, and the movie is done to near perfection. The movie is glorious, the CGI is fantastic, the battles are awe-inspiring, and Thanos is made worth of your fear from the very beginning. He is truly the Mad Titan that captures your heart and crushes it right in front of your eyes. Anyone who doesn't think this clearly didn't see the same movie."
Avengers: Infinity War,20-May-18,"With the beggining of the movie it was full of surpises. 
What I really liked in the movie was the serious tone and the real threat hanging over the Avengers. Yes...this is THANOS ! He is an amazing villain ! 
MARVEL Studious show us once again that their production are spectacular visual!"
Avengers: Infinity War,23-May-18,"I absolutely loved this movie. It was intense, action-packed and emotional. Also delivering comedy when needed, but it was a relatively dark film. All of the actors delivered great performances and the characters continue to be fleshed out and be made human despite the fact that they're superheroes. This is easily the best superhero movie ever made. Thanos is one of the best villains of the MCU, as well as one of the best of Cinematic history in general. Upon first viewing, I hated him, but found his character intriguing. Similar to Emperor Palpatine in the Original and Prequel trilogies of Star Wars. The more times I rewatch it though, I start to understand Thanos' point of view more and more. The blurred lines with his motivations make the movie more compelling. Even driving some people to say that Thanos was right in all this. I wouldn't go that far, but I would say his character is misunderstood. Definitely a compelling villain in Thanos. The ending of the movie was insanely emotional, but I love how they (mainly) set aside the original Avengers team to take on Thanos in the fourth Avengers movie. I, for one, cannot wait.That eerie ""Thanos will return"" at the end of the film sent a chill down my spine. It truly is the end game now, and I can't wait to see the Avengers rise up and likely defeat Thanos in the next movie.+Every Hero has their moment to shine (Much like the villain wants, the movie achieves balance in this way)
+Good Comedic moments to balance (again pun intended) the dark tone of the film
+Emotional and Heavy ending (Seeing Earths Mightiest fail is something devastating to watch)
+Complete hype moments that reward you for being a fan of this franchise for 10 years
+Incredible performances
+Phenomenal original score 
Etc. Not much you can find that's wrong with this movie. It's literally the perfect movie Marvel has been building up to for 10 years. And those that claim it didn't have an ending as a negative, I beg to differ. Just because the villain won doesn't mean it didn't have an ending. My Rating: 10/10"
Avengers: Infinity War,26-Apr-18,"Engrossing, Epic, Emotional. Those are the three E's that define this movie. The latest instalment of the Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise is at its very best, culminating ten years of marvel adventure and spectacle with the biggest and most boldest movie in the superhero genre. 
So let's start with Anthony and Joe Russo, the geniuses that made this beast of a movie. After announcing that they will be directing the next two Avengers movies, Marvel fans knew at once that this will be the darkest Avengers movie yet. Yes, it was very dark with more of a serious tone. More than Winter Soldier and Civil War (previous marvel movies directed by the Russo Bothers) combined but they also had what the other Avengers movies had as well, the humour and it was not at all tasteless. Nobody really cared if it was necessary or not because the humour worked along with the edgy parts of the movie. This is by far the Russo brothers best work among the Marvel movies completely raising the bar of superhero movies to it's highest. Praise to Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely for writing the amazing script (they also wrote the scripts of Captain America, The Avengers, Winter Soldier, Age of Ultron and Civil War also known to be the best marvel movies). 
Now, the characters and story. Practically everyone that you've seen in the previous marvel movies that aren't dead, are in this movie. Everyone had the chance to shine even if it's the smallest way possible. There were so many character arcs in this movie and none of them were cut short or boring. Every scene is in the movie was worth digesting and deciphering, along with the surprises and the twists and turns that will get audiences on the edge of their seat. Everything from character development to the pacing of the storyline, makes you jump, scream, gasp or cry. 
And of course, the one and only, Thanos. The villain that has been teased one too many times is finally here and he delivers. Josh Brolin officially portrays the best villain in the MCU, completely pissing on Marvel's villain problem. He brings all out on the table with everything he's got. Not only will you hate Thanos by the end of the movie, but you will understand him and maybe even feel sorry for him for a few seconds. They brought layers into him that no one has seen in a movie portrayal of a Marvel villain. They made him scary and strong at the same time vulnerable and understandable. The motivation of his doing and his character development made him the best character in the movie, making the movie all about him. 
I cannot tell you anymore about this movie because then I would be spoiling. All I have to say is that whether you're a marvel fan or not, and if you at least know what has been going on in the previous marvel movies, GO AND WATCH IT. It will not be a waste of your time or money. Digest this to prepare for what's to come. I may be bias once again but I just have to. I have to rate this movie 10/10. If I don't, I would be betraying myself."
Avengers: Infinity War,03-Jun-18,"I went and looked, and I want to express my thoughts.I went to this film with very high expectations, with a sense of something. I went to him twice, the first time, myself, and the second with the family, and I was even surprised that my mother, sister and dad (who do not understand this movie at all) brought unreal pleasure and an ocean of emotions.Each frame, each scene does not let you get bored, from the Marvel logo, and to the stage after the credits. Favorite heroes once again experienced side by side and you feel it, you are completely absorbed in a hurricane of events and you are watching it in one breath. In comparison with the War of Infinity, even the Confrontation looks like an ordinary fight in the sandbox.Uuuu, and the villain, the best as for me the best in this kirovoveselennoy, he is not just a bot at once, without motivation, no, it's just the opposite. I liked Thanos so much that you do not want to, and he began to impress me, in terms of his convictions (I had it only once, with Joker Heath Ledger). He has feelings, he makes choices, he's alive.Tense scenes are beautiful, in one moment I still let off a meager male tear (and this happens to me very, very rarely). What about the humor, the jokes are correct for me, and they do not bother you like Thor: Ragnarok, although in the beginning they look a little tight. Well, the action, it is very high-quality, and in comparison with the Black Panther is generally ideal.And of course the film can not be without punctures. The lack of predictability of some story lines, and a couple of moments that were very predictable, but they are fade against the background of all this scale.Yes, you will not find anything in this film about something, something, but, what, what, what, steep humor. Thanks to Marvel and of course the Rousseau brothers, the beautiful actors and the wonderful movie that I've been waiting for for 3 years.Out of 10, I give the War of Infinity 9."
Avengers: Infinity War,04-May-18,"Let me be clear Infinity War is not flawless, it has its faults but thankfully they are overshadowed by two hours of awesomeness.Every movie in the Marvel universe for the last decade has ultimately been building up to this therefore expectations were through the roof and for the most part it delivers.Almost every character from the MCU teams up to face its most dangerous foe yet, the mad titan himself Thanos and if you know anything about the comics then going in you'd know to brace yourself for heartache.With all the hype as to who wouldn't survive the film I'm left wondering just how many deaths are permanent, this is a superhero universe after all so never say never.Though the story and Thanos's motivations differ from the comic this can be forgiven as the new story is wafer thin but competent.As you can imagine one of the most exciting things about Infinity War was uniting heroes we've never seen side by side and that certainly delivers on all fronts. The action is thick and fast, despite the dark overtone we have plenty of comedy and teenage Groot didn't ruin the film like I feared he would.Obviously this is not a big finale and merely a high profile chapter in a much larger story but the movie is highly climatic regardless.I am saddened that this wasn't a two parter, alike Civil War (2016) this was a huge story and perhaps should have been broken up across movies.Infinity War is a contender for the best Marvel movie and instead of feeling burnt out after the never ending stream of films this has wet my appetite for more and I can't wait for the next film.Excellent stuff, though where in the blue hell was Ant Man?The Good:Children of ThanosThanosAll out action as expectedTies everything together nicelyThe Bad:Peter Dinklage (Never thought I'd say that)So many characters were spread too thinThings I Learnt From This Movie:If Thanos and Cable ever meet its going to be super weirdDishonest footage/photos are commonplace now (Look up the footage of Hulk in Wakanda running with the rest of the team) Seriously, never happened.Somewhere out there right now are DC fans claiming this is a bad film"
Avengers: Infinity War,25-Apr-18,"Well, Well, Well....I was so ready to tear this down - 19th MCU film, too many stars, bloated CGI, first of a two parter, and so on and so on...Yet, this is so much fun. Pure popcorn...now in the dictionary under ""popcorn film"" is just the poster for this film. Somehow, the Russo Brothers have juggled all the parts to give everyone some time in the sun. They are helped immensely by two things: the premise is so pure Mcguffin that you just watch Thanos look for Infinity Stones which gives a primal momentum and that the film's stars/characters are looking to move on - that means, actual stakes for once as people could really die and not just comic book dying either.The DC people must be kicking themselves. The lightness and comedic touches are brilliant. You are laughing out loud, comedy level, but at totally organic character humour. It means you are so entertained throughout its rather long running time.The other big surprise is Thanos himself. Normally, I hate CGI characters but somehow they have made Thanos and Josh Brolin work enough to give the character an actual arc. This is one of the better MCU villains and I never thought I would write that.The stakes are real, the charisma levels are amazing, it is like ""Oceans 28"" and I can't wait for the sequel...that says an enormous amount considering the challenges this film faced."
Avengers: Infinity War,25-Apr-18,"Oh. My. God. What an incredible film! I've never done a review of a movie before, I've only done TV shows. So bare with me, I'm gonna discuss the major points and chuck in a theory or two. But to start off...Wow. This film could be the best Marvel movie ever! But I will give it a few days to digest and probably a second viewing before deciding on that. It absolutely lived up to the 10 year build up since Iron Man 1, how far we've come in a quick 10 years is remarkable. The Thanos character absolutely hit the mark. He was menacing, intimidating, vicious and so much more. Props to the actor who played him. Thanos' plan succeeds (for the time being) and we get a whole lot of ""death"" because of it. In this movie there was death, and ""death"". The former refers to characters such as Loki, Vision and Gamora. We saw these characters die and there bodies be left behind. For this movie not to lose credibility, these characters, in my opinion, must remain dead. Now ""death"" refers to what we saw at the end, Thanos, with all infinity stones, clicked his fingers and half of humanity, including half of the avengers (important to note that all the original avengers are still alive) dissolved into dust giving the impression of death. I expect these characters to come back at some point during the next Avengers film, most likely due to the originals saving them. My final theory regards Doctor Strange. On the ship with Stark and Spidey, Strange said that if it came to it he would save his stone over Stark and Spidey's lives. However, in the end we see Strange give up the stone to Thanos on the condition Stark stay alive. My prediction is that when Strange saw all the possible futures, the only future in which they win must heavily rely on Tony Stark. Which makes sense, Tony started it all so he should finish it. Incredible film, can't wait for the next one to see how it all resolves. 9.8/10"
Avengers: Infinity War,25-Apr-18,"This movie has made me feel things that I haven't about a movie in a very long time. If you are anything like me you will definitely feel a sense of ""everything is gonna be alright"" because of the generous sprinkling of light humour that makes the situation feel less serious than it actually is. The emotional roller coaster that begins right at the beginning of the movie to the very end has you feeling more and more frustrated and on edge as it goes on. Don't get me wrong this movie is absolutely stunning and amazing and a cliffhanger at the end has you wanting more and more. I'm definitely very excited to see how this storyline will carry out in the next Avengers movie."
Avengers: Infinity War,12-May-18,"I don't mean to be negative here, but Avengers: Infinity War's 8.9 on IMDb is entirely undeserved. Marvel superfan or not, this movie has nothing on films like The Dark Night, La La Land, Pulp Fiction, or Inception, all films which it either outranks based on it's 8.9 rating or comes close to. I get that there was an insane amount of hype around this film, and it's awesome to see our favorite Marvel characters come together (The Guardians of the Galaxy, Thor, Spiderman, Captain America, Black Panther, etc.), but we shouldn't let our excitement over all of our favorite characters coming together cloud the fact that ""Avengers: Infinity War"" is an overly long movie that relies on cheap, unbelievable deaths to generate excitement and that isn't particularly well written or edited. I commend the directors and writers on being able to successfully interweave so many stories, but the movie just felt too long. It's fight scene after fight scene, and while the performances are good and the script is pretty funny, the film isn't really original and its only redeeming factor is that it's full of characters we all know and love. It's funny to see Thor poke fun at the Guardians of the Galaxy and to see Iron Man and Spiderman interact with Doctor Strange, but when we look at the film objectively, it's really just a standard superhero film (with more superheroes than normal) that relies on cheap plot twists to generate excitement and emotion. No matter how much we love Marvel, we all know that there's no way any of the characters who ""died"" are actually going to die. The filmmakers expect us to believe that Black Panther (who just made Marvel over one billion dollars), Spiderman, and the Guardians of the Galaxy have all met the end of their respective stories, even when there are publicly announced sequels for all three franchises. I hate to say it, but all the character deaths at the end are just there for shock value, and it's cheap. From a technical perspective, the fight scenes are directed well, but that's about it. The editing isn't particularly great and the film feels too long at 2 hours and 40 minutes. I feel like half of the time spent hopping from planet to planet could have been cut and the movie would have been about as good if not better. OVERALL: ""Avengers: Infinity War"" could have been amazing, but it's too long and relies on cheap deaths to generate hype. This film is not deserving of it's 8.9 rating on IMDb. I think that Captain America: Civil War was a *much* better movie.6.5 out of 10."
Avengers: Infinity War,03-May-18,"This movie was an underwhelming, chaotic blend of several different movies. I'm going to break down several of the different elements of the movie and why they either worked or really did not work. I'll start with the villain:Thanos, as a whole, is a pretty good villain. He is intimidating and the movie gave him a good script. The problem is that his powers are so freakin inconsistent. Guardians of the Galaxy already established just how powerful infinity stones are, but Infinity War seems to forget that. In the battle on Titan, Iron Man and about five others are able to hold Thanos down and nearly get his gauntlet off. At this point, Thanos has four infinity stones. Sorry, but there is no way they could restrain him at that point.  Infinity War also includes four other villains which the directors apparently felt had no need for an introduction. Collectively, they are called the Black Order (or dark order) and their names are never said so, I'll give them nicknames. There is Noseless the Terrible(who is terrible), Avatar Lady with Horns (also terrible), Rock Dude (basically Korg but bigger with a goatee), and Guy with Pointy Axe. The only people who understand who the heck these characters are, are Marvel comic fans. The biggest problem with Infinity War is the character developments and inconsistencies. I'll describe the worst cases:Star-Lord: When the first Guardians of the Galaxy came out, Star-Lord was a great character. Infinity War completely ruins him. He turns into a jealous jerk and an actual idiot. There are brief flashes of the old Star-Lord but mostly he is just a character that you despise. At one point during the battle on Titan (Thanos's home planet), Iron Man, Doctor Strange, and the Guardians of the Galaxy have Thanos held down and they nearly remove his gauntlet (which makes no sense in the first place because at this point Thanos has four feakin infinity stones). As they are removing the glove from Thanos's hand, Star-Lord finds out that Thanos killed Gamora earlier in the movie. 
Star-Lord then starts punching him and this wakes him up from Mantis's mind powers and this time he demolishes them before going on to destroy half the galaxy. Vision: The development of Vision is also really, really bad. In Age of Ultron he is strong enough to wield Thor's hammer but in Infinity War, he has developed and updated to the point that he never wins a single fight against anyone because it fits the plot. Thor: So in Thor: Ragnarok it was established that Thor is the god of thunder and doesn't need a hammer to be powerful. Then in Infinity War they completely forget this and make him get tossed around like a ragdoll. In fact, he never even uses his lightning abilities until he forges his new weapon. Did the directors forget about what got established in Ragnarok or did they just make Thor weak because once again it fits the plot and Marvel can get away with whatever the heck they want?Scarlet Witch: Wow! Her character was inconsistent. One minute she is getting demolished by some dark order member and the next she is holding off Thanos (who has five infinity stones at this point) for an extended period of time. Once again her powers are only as powerful as the directors need them to be for any given scene. Hulk: So apparently the Hulk is now scared to come out? Ahh, poor little guy. This is a terrible plot twist and really doesn't make much sense. Another thing that did not work about this movie was the sheer amount of characters. I was worried that it might be too many and it was. As a result, there were too many different subplots going on and they couldn't even have one final battle. They had to have two climactic battles going on at one time and the result was a bloated mass of CGI filled action for the last forty-five minutes of the movie. Now, I'll discuss the action in the movie by rating each of the major battles with a brief description:New York battle: 2/10 This battle was absolutely terrible. Noseless the Terrible comes in with the Rock Dude and tears up the city to take Doctor Strange away and nothing about the action is even slightly thrilling. The action in Alicia Vikander's Tomb Raider was better than the action in this battle.Wakanda battle: 8/10 This battle was actually pretty thrilling with great background music and some really cool action. The first half of this battle is a lot better than the second though. It also gets annoying because it's only fed to you in short segments while flashing back to the battle on Titan or Thor forging his hammer-axe-thingy. Overall though, this battle was good and part of the reason that I give Infinity War a 6 and not something much lower.Battle on Titan: 6/10 While, there is some good action in this battle, there are also a ton of inconsistencies revolving around Thanos and how powerful he is. Overall, I wasn't super impressed.I also need to discuss Thanos's plan for a second. He wants to wipe out half of the universe's population because the universe is overcrowded. Then he can finally rest. Did he think of the fact that the universe will repopulate again and all his hard work will be for nothing? I definitely prefer a storyline that involves the threat of total destruction of earth. Finally, I am going to discuss the characters that are killed in the movie and why it makes Avengers 4 really predictable. So at the end of the movie, Thanos snaps his fingers with all the infinity stones and half of the universe is killed. Somehow by random selection, all the original avengers survive. The odds of that happening are 1 in 64 assuming Hawkeye survived the dreaded finger snap of Thanos or 1 in 32 if he died while having his epic gaming session with friends (guess he got bored of the whole avengers thing). The characters that die are almost all new characters like Black Panther, Spiderman, Doctor Strange, etc. Several of these characters already have planned sequels so we know they are going to come back when the original Avengers find a way to time travel and reverse everything. It's just too predictable.Overall, Infinity War was not a very good movie. I do not understand the hype. It was choppy, inconsistent, overcrowded and overall just not the great movie it's cracked up to be. I would not recommend going to the theater for this one. I left feeling exhausted and tired of the MCU."
Avengers: Infinity War,25-Apr-18,"The most anticipated movie of 2018 has now been released and my word, I have to say that Infinity War was brilliant on each scale, whether be its story, Visual Effects and the ensemble cast consisting all the Marvel characters. Every Marvel Fan needs to watch the movie as words cannot describe the magnificience of the movie."
Avengers: Infinity War,26-Apr-18,"Just WOW , The Russo nailed it, hand down from me they did it again. Part by part is interesting to watch , some of scene make me shock some scene make me wanna punch people so bad. Thanos is the best villain I've ever seen. He not just normal villain to kill bunch of people because he love but his motivation so clear why he wanna do that and most people know he is collecting all the infinity stones. One of the best part of it the team up Guardian & Avengers just amazing, full of humor cannot stop laughing watching their scene together. For 1st time my brain cannot process what going to happen in Avengers 4 really hype about it.Really worth watching it , if u non Marvel fans or superheroes fan this movie is worth to watch , really enjoy it . Of course every good movie always have some issue with it but just MINOR issue can close eye and let it go. Going to watch it again soon . Love from Malaysia."
Avengers: Infinity War,22-May-18,Just neglect the so called reviews.Its personal views and differs from person to person.Make your own review and keep it to yourself.
Avengers: Infinity War,01-May-18,"Foreword: I was dragged to watch this film. Disney are trying to hard. Trying to hard to cram superficial pop culture references into every 5 minutes of ""dialogue"". Trying too hard to take a tongue-in-cheek, meta approach to tired superhero movie cliches, like that makes them any better. Now they're giving us an predictably unpredictable ending to a mediocre procession of cliche, angsty superheroes.Disney have utterly destroyed modern mainstream cinema."
Avengers: Infinity War,23-May-18,"I really liked the first Guardians of the Galaxy. Likewise Iron Man & The Avengers. But these never-ending franchise add-ons are pretty boring unless you're 12 or a CGI junkie. There's very little evidence of a story behind all of the mind-boggling action, over acted drama, and special effects. It drives me nuts anymore, when fighting takes a 5 minute 'time out' for a lame, ""poignant"" dialog scene. I guess that I've seen too many of these to enjoy them anymore."
Avengers: Infinity War,30-Apr-18,"I'm not a huge fan of the superhero genre, but I'm able to appreciate these movies and have a good time when I watch them, however I can't say the same for Infinity War. Overall it was just a huge mess. A basic cliché formula which consisted entirely of several over-the-top action sequences with snarky one-liners from the ""characters"" every now and then. The plot barely made any sense, in fact most of the time I barely knew what was going on and the villain's motives were unoriginal and cliché There was apparently supposed to be a lot of emotional weight to this film but it just wasn't there for me. The balance between all the humor and high stakes was just completely off so I didn't know which scenes to take seriously or not.I think the weirdest part of this movie for me was that the Avengers felt oddly out of place for most of it. The Guardians Of The Galaxy are featured far more prominently so the rest of the characters just feel like random background soldiers who show up every few minutes to kick some ass."
The Very Excellent Mr. Dundee,18-Jul-20,"After seeing so many scathing reviews I decided to watch it anyway.
In covid times this movie provides light relief and a chuckle here and there.
I do forgive the short comings of the film.
Paul Hogan portrays a sense of sadness which revolves around the aging process and that gives the film some merit and a few bitter sweet humorous moments.
Like the weaker of the Marx Brothers movies the world is a better place that they exist rather than not."
The Very Excellent Mr. Dundee,17-Jul-20,"Didn't really know what to expect when i started my account and first selected this movie, what i can say i'm more that pleasantly surprised on how much i enjoyed it. The cameos are fantastic, the movie and locations look superb and it's a lot fun.Look at it as one long roast of Paul Hogan. The gags are funny, the movie sets a good pace and the musical number is a true highlight.It's a comedy and suitable for the whole family. If this just happens to be the last movie Paul Hogan ever does, well i can say he's gone out on a high note and for what he's done for Australia. Then good on you mate!!!"
The Very Excellent Mr. Dundee,19-Jul-20,"Paul Hogan is an Aussie icon and I have loved him since The Paul Hogan Show! This, however is absolute rubbish and I feel embarrassed for Paul. I can't understand why he, and the other well known Aussie actors would lower their standards by participating in this poorly thought out train wreck. I turned it off half way through not wanting to taint my opinion of such an Aussie legend. Retire gracefully Paul, you don't need to do crap like this! Disappointed"
The Very Excellent Mr. Dundee,27-Jul-20,"I loved the trailer for the movie, and it is what hooked me into watching it. I anticipated it wold be good, and I wasn't disappointed. I thought it was a fun lighthearted movie with several giggles. It has some great messages, especially the last scene. I thought Paul too looked awesome for 79. It was nice seeing so many cameos.I would love Paul to make another movie. He still has ""it"" !!"
The Very Excellent Mr. Dundee,26-Jul-20,"Lots of humor at Paul's expense, cool cameos and many of the jokes are well-written and effective. I liked it. John Cleese is especially hilarious."
The Very Excellent Mr. Dundee,18-Jul-20,"Being a long time Paul Hogan fan it was great to see him back in top form. The pokes and jabs at the Hollywood system are fun and playful when watching someone in his 80s roll his eyes at a community that is self obsessed, materialistic and clutching to keep itself alive and relevent. However for all the moments where Hoges shines, it's the woeful co-stars, particularly that of his manager, that make it so cringe worthy. Some terrible acting, terrible green screen work and strange editing make this go from a possible 8 to a so-so six.Thank you Hoges - this one isnt your fault."
The Very Excellent Mr. Dundee,21-Jul-20,This is great film if you read what message it says. On one side the world worships you and then wants to destroy you if you don't fit in. This is a film I would highly recommend to those who want to see good fun and some honesty about how the older generations get tried and tribulated by the media they once served money to.
The Very Excellent Mr. Dundee,18-Jul-20,What a wonderful light hearted comedy. I nice swan song for Hogan. Not taking life to seriously this is a great family movie.
The Very Excellent Mr. Dundee,19-Jul-20,"Okay, Hoges is 80 now so those expecting him to be as funny in his heyday is expecting too much.
That being said, this movie is still very funny because he plays the situations he's placed in well and, frankly, he's still got it in my opinion.
Whoever wrote and directed this deserve praise too.
Some probably don't like that the current politics is played for laughs but its hardly something that hasn't been done before, the random person the goofball stuffing up and being falsely accused, and becoming a social pariah.
I laughed a lot so that's the main thing."
The Very Excellent Mr. Dundee,26-Jul-20,"This is not academy award material, but it was a lot of laughs. mr dundee was like a deer in the headlights kind of role. bad things kept happening to him despite the fact he kept trying to do the right thing. meanwhile the reporters kept coming down on him hard in one wild scene after another. watch it for the laughs and don't get to serious."
The Very Excellent Mr. Dundee,18-Jul-20,"Paul Hogan stars in this slapdash comedy where the beloved Australian icon is being awarded a knighthood for services to comedy, nominations must have closed prior to the release date. The standout performance in this 90 minute 'masterpiece' is definitely the jar of Vegemite, it's smooth ability and onscreen presence is unrivalled by it's costars. Hoges was of course in fine form and is still the loveable larrikin we know him to be."
The Very Excellent Mr. Dundee,17-Jul-20,"I didn't have high hopes for this and at the time, there were no ratings or reviews on IMDB, so I though I'd check it out.Paul Hogan plays Paul Hogan trying to resurrect his acting career. I love Hoges, but nothing even remotely amusing had happened a third of the way through this 90 minute film. Don't let the impressive cameos fool you. This is atrocious. I can't even see who this is aimed at. Kids? Adults looking for a dose of 80s nostalgia?Please don't even bother with this."
The Very Excellent Mr. Dundee,18-Jul-20,This movie didn't need to happen and should be avoided.
The Very Excellent Mr. Dundee,17-Jul-20,"At the end of this film I was left with the feeling that there was no apparent story or plot to drive this film along. There was some funny bits and pieces from other actors. Sadly it was a drudge to watch, perhaps Paul needs to cheer up a bit and join in."
The Very Excellent Mr. Dundee,18-Jul-20,Comedian turned filmmaker Paul Hogan earned his 1987 Best original screenplay Oscar nomination for Crocodile Dundee and this film shows that he still has the goods. My mate Brent thinks I'm just being nostalgic or making up a good review for a laugh but he is wrong wrong wrong.
The Very Excellent Mr. Dundee,20-Jul-20,"A tribute to Hogans original work! Little course and a bit edge, but never apologizing for what it is, which is a dose of humour that whether we like to admit it or not, makes us laugh.It does an exceptional job at holding a mirror to the hypocrisy that is modern day television and stardom, especially in Hollywood and it provides a ironically save platform for big names to put their signature on a clear and deserved critique of a culture that would easily castrate them doing so in any other venue.Smart writing that will rattle a few cages that deserve to be rattled."
The Very Excellent Mr. Dundee,18-Jul-20,"I have been a long time Hoges fan, but this movie is mediocre at best. Depressing, the only good bits are in the last 5 minutes. Definitely no Crocodile Dundee!"
The Very Excellent Mr. Dundee,19-Jul-20,The worst movie I have ever seen. I couldn't even finish it.
The Very Excellent Mr. Dundee,23-Jul-20,"Honestly don't understand what's up with all the great reviews. Are they paid?
The film starts of bad and only gets worse.
Who made this garbage?
This is the worst movie of all time !
Acting terrible. Story terrible. Amusement factor Zero.
It has one solitary redeeming feature, it ends.
Sadly it takes around 90 minutes to do that.
This was just awful. The writer deserves a d...ck.of the year award for writing this POS."
The Very Excellent Mr. Dundee,22-Jul-20,"Pushed myself to watch 30 mins, cringe, why would anyone agree to do this, worse than a late night 70's telethon, truly a shocker!"
The Very Excellent Mr. Dundee,22-Jul-20,"Looking at the list of reviews, i expected this to be complete waste of time. However i thoroughly enjoyed this film. There are enough glimpses of the absurdities that are thrust upon celebrities by the media, and this film pokes fun at them, while giving us a few real glimpses into what celebs have to put up with. This film was made to be fun and i feel that it shows through. It was great to see the many cameos of some great comedians/actors/entertainers. All in all, I am left with a pleasant experience from this film."
The Very Excellent Mr. Dundee,17-Jul-20,"Terrible movie. Not one laugh at all.
Nothing else needs to be said about this sad, pathetic waste of 90 mins"
The Very Excellent Mr. Dundee,20-Jul-20,"Why why why?
Full credit to Hoags for giving it a shot.
But don't waste your time."
The Very Excellent Mr. Dundee,20-Jul-20,"I like Paul Hogan.
This is really not a great film.
I will say the audio and video quality are outstanding, I just wish the script and acting was.
The whole production looks like a vehicle to trundle out some ageing actors for one last time and that is a little disturbing."
The Very Excellent Mr. Dundee,18-Jul-20,"This movie is by far Paul Hogan's worst. The movie had no plot whatsoever, big A-list actors that were not relevant, terrible production quality they try to make it look like LA where you can clearly see its all green screen in Australia, annoying music score, lot of Aussie actors doing terrible American impersonations, horrible dialogue and not funny at all the only time I laughed was when Chevy Chase did his cameo. It was just a completely stupid movie that Im glad got pulled from it's cinema release and straight to Amazon prime cause if I had paid to see it I would demand my money back."
Guns Akimbo,03-Mar-20,"People complaining about plot and and style clearly don't understand that there are different genres of movies. Obviously this isn't an Oscar contender but it's a great ride. Daniel Radcliffe continues to show his range as an actor by taking on roles that most A-listers wouldn't go near. His success as the boy who lived has given him the freedom to chose the roles he wants and to actually have fun making movies. Something that is very refreshing to see. Samara Weaving is brilliant and it's a joy to see her as the character Nix. She's gonna be huge in the next few years.If you enjoy action movies, with outrageous violence, well choreographed fight scenes and over the top characters then you'll enjoy this film. It moves fast and doesn't take itself too serious. It's an easy watch, and slightly predictable. Although that's what you sign up for, and the movie makes you well aware of that."
Guns Akimbo,01-Mar-20,"This is the kind of film you have to just put your mind on autopilot for and enjoy. The action and shootout scenes are very well done, with some sharp direction and editing. The story is a little too absurd and not based in reality whatsoever, but that's the point. It reminds me a bit of the movie Shoot 'Em Up, which was another tongue-in-cheek gun extravaganza, but fortunately Guns Akimbo is a lot funnier and more stylish, making it a pretty cool watch if you're not looking for anything mind-expanding."
Guns Akimbo,29-Feb-20,The negative reviews for this movie are hilarious. Are you expecting Shakespearean grade storytelling from a movie whose main character has guns bolted to his hands? This is meant to be pure entertainment and it delivers balls to the wall action mixed with over the top humour. I was genuinely entertained while watching this and I'm glad I decided to ignore the negativity surrounding it. It's best to just suspend belief and enjoy this film for what it is.
Guns Akimbo,29-Feb-20,"Guns Akimbo can best be described as a film that had ingredients for a cult classic but its lack of adequate direction and pacing hold it back from reaching its full potential. This film is a bit too full of itself to capture a wide audience because of its overbearing gamer culture references which easily could have been dumbed-down or removed completely. Another big problem of Guns Akimbo is the borderline amateurish dialogue which made almost every exchange between any character seem either unintentionally funny or uncomfortably dull.It goes without saying that Guns Akimbo is not a horrible movie as it does have its moments featuring charismatic performances from Daniel Radcliffe and Samara Weaving, some gory violence and a simple enough plot, making it at a fun ride throughout. It doesn't particularly deliver on anything; there are some mid-budget shootouts and chase scenes which are fun as can be expected but nothing that you haven't seen already. This project just should have spent more time in the furnace and been decorated with more colourful toppings.In all of its splattery glory, Guns Akimbo is very fun to watch if you can get behind the pacing, the needless gaming references and its self-assertive plot.Final Rating - 4/10"
Guns Akimbo,29-Feb-20,"This is film is in line with Deadpool, Kingsman, Kick-Ass. Plenty of gore, absolutely crazy and funny. The action scenes are well done (keeping in mind the budget is minimum). Daniel Radcliffe is likeable lead, Samara is becoming one of the reliable upcoming star. Do watch if you're a fan of those aforementioned films."
Guns Akimbo,10-Jun-20,Non-stop action that is so unbelievable that you will ask yourself who thought this crap up. But it works well. Daniel Radcliffe play the innocent character to a tee and makes all the wrong choices perfectly. Worth the watch.
Guns Akimbo,17-Feb-20,"Daniel Radcliffe is no longer just the guy who starred in Harry Potter. To prove that he is a real actor and not a creature of one character, Radcliffe has continued to risk it all in a wide variety of his artistic experiments. He is ready to appear naked on stage in a potentially perilous performance, he then went with a movie crew to film in an actual jungle and he now plays in a movie where the plot goes non-stop and there can be no respite from action at all.The main character of the movie is an unfortunate reclusive video game developer who never parts with a cup of coffee and tends to spend his weekends at home wearing a dirty robe. However, one day, everything changes when Miles is pulled out and forced to become a member of a dangerous game called ""SKIZM"". The purpose of the event seems simple, but that is a dangerous misconception. Homicidal lunatics are running the streets and firing at each other. Viewers pay money to watch this event, its sadistic organizers are pleased by its chaos. It is only the participants who can never feel safe.This is really crazy but a totally enthralling experience. The movie is really interesting and holds viewers in complete suspense. You just sit and keep an eye on Radcliffe, who had transformed for this role and does not even look like himself. His hero, Miles, is a typical nonstarter, but at the same time he has the kind of luck most people can only dream of in real life. All this may be fantastic, but it is fun and smashing from beginning to end.The verdict: You have to go and watch this movie; because it is not often that you will feel this much adrenaline! I definitely want to view Guns Akimbo one more time!"
Guns Akimbo,20-Apr-20,"If you loved the classic, Crank, give this a go.
Damn, now I've over-hyped it.Guns Akimbo is a cheap-looking, cheesy, pop-culture-quoting, ridiculously over-the-top relentless assault in the senses and that's what makes it so fun (or not, if you're one of the viewers who gave the film 2 stars)."
Guns Akimbo,29-Feb-20,"Its really a quest these days to find anything worth watching. Trashy, cyber punk, anime mash up mess ""Guns Akimbo"", underlines this point.It tries far, far too hard. Its characterisations are encrusted with unfunny cliches, as is its all too predictable story line. The inclination to lecture whilst offering scraps of entertainment is ever present too. This time its the evils of the internet, which seems to be populated by hordes of trolls, perverts and pyscho killers. ""Yawn"".Seriously uninspiring. 3/10."
Guns Akimbo,28-Feb-20,"""Guns Akimbo"" or, in other words, Jason Lei Howden's millennial, culturally relevant in 2019 spiritual relative of ""Crank"". Jokes (and Howden's twitter mess) aside, ""Guns Akimbo"" provides some real fun, mostly in terms of action and other visual treats, with Radcliffe and Weaving adding bonus points. Other than that, it's flawed enough.""Guns Akimbo"" introduces us to a world much like ours plus ""Schism"", which we, thankfully, don't have as of yet. The hero, or, in simple terms, a loser (un)intentionally steps on Schism's admin's toes and now has been pitted against the champion Nix with revolvers bolted to his hands. What follows is nearly 90 minutes of action - chases, gunfights, racing, explosions and so on and so forth. It's undeniably entertaining visually and is supported by creative and dynamic camerawork, vivid and explosive color grading and crafty editing that's reaching over the line of overkill at times. Rest assured that violence gets provided in satisfactory amounts. There's so much action that compensates for the lack of some other elements & eventually ""Guns Akimbo"" can turn out mind-numbing for some. Radcliffe and Weaving are definitely having fun, offer up playful performances and some hit&miss one-liners. The comedy in ""Guns Akimbo"" is indeed of the hit&miss nature, perhaps maybe even more on the miss side. Jason Lei Howden has tried to insert social commentary, talk about our generation's thirst for blood and utter necessity to feel better at all times, the awful mess that internet is, but that all finishes its run in like the first 1/3 of the movie. Point being, ""Guns Akimbo"" essence and point is mostly just high entertainment value. And it's good in those terms. Besides our two shining leads, Ned Dennehy also adds some fun, being maybe a little too comicky, but eccentric and pleasantly insane villain.""Guns Akimbo"" is a top tier action flick, top notch indie eye candy & an absolute blast for the hero of the day, Daniel Radcliffe. Past all that, it's just an okay movie. If you need some fast-paced, no-brakes, easy-on-the-brain fun, this goes out as recommendation especially for You. My rating: 7/10."
Guns Akimbo,29-Feb-20,Really. This film is a editing nightmare. Maybe mindless but not even fun. Dialogue is one-liners and not funny. They are all trying but is is just one big mess
Guns Akimbo,29-Feb-20,"This is VFX pro Jason Lei Howden's 2nd full length feature film as newb writer and director, and he delivered. Think Gamer meets Suicide Squad and you end up with mindless fun entertainment with stunning visuals, and I do mean stunning. The story was fun and the directing on point with excellent cinematography and VFX. I was pleasantly surprised that Daniel Radcliffe pulled off his character extremely well. For that matter, all cast performances were great. The score was very fitting and the 95 min runtime and pacing were just right. Sad to see the undeserving low ratings, this film has great qualities - especially considering it's from a new filmmaker, and it was really fun and funny! A well deserving 9/10 from me"
Guns Akimbo,02-Mar-20,"This is not Upgrade.
This is not Crank.This is garbage.I went into watching this with an open mind, wanting to get a bit of laughs and thrills, given the fact that this sort of movie type has been done before, I was hoping for this to be sort of good.
But boy was I wrong!This film does not have a clue what it wants to be.. be it comedy, action, drama, quasi-comic adaptation. It's none of the above.
It's boring, repetitive, badly acted, the CGI is laughable and the action scenes pull you out of the movie.Please, don't watch this.
It is NOT good. It's not even ""sso bad it's good"" bad.It's just a waste of time."
Guns Akimbo,04-Mar-20,"The movie is full on entertainer with action, blood and yes the rocking music🤘. The story is simple and pacy . Really enjoyable and samara rocks so does danny. Full on popcorn movie."
Guns Akimbo,29-Feb-20,Attempts at comedy are feeble tries at being relatable and the action sequences are awkward and stupid like a 4 year olds with adhd's trying to paint.
Guns Akimbo,01-Mar-20,"Movie is awful. No likeable characters, epileptic action sequences, dumb writing, dumber directing and preachy liberal jibes throughout. They literally have second amendment supporters named things like ""h8 is gr8"" in the internet chatrooms where our brave liberal hero is arguing at the start of the film. What a way to get people on-side. Then there is the Chinese, rainbow haired love interest.. it's great how they manage to combine pandering to China and pandering to LGBT in one character. No 2020 movie would be complete without a super cool, super tough, super stunning and brave superhero woman and this movie is no exception. She kills dozens of men like she's John Wick, but as soon as she goes after the main character she becomes a Star Wars storm trooper. Miss it."
Guns Akimbo,29-Feb-20,"It sucks. It looks like a Russian blockbuster.
A drunken epileptic is running around with a camera. The screenwriter and director are trying to catch this epileptic and take their drugs."
Guns Akimbo,02-Mar-20,"This movie couldn't decide if it wanted to be Gamer or Scott Pilgrim with a little Player One thrown in there for spice. The one thing all those movies had, at least, was a story. There's no background information to really get you into the world or really any character development. I feel just thrown into a try hard comedic action movie. Nothing felt like it flowed or felt ""real"". This would pass as an entertaining YouTuber made project movie. Like old school SMOSH or Film Riot. Actors and Actresses involved must have done it for fun. I guess it's fun for a mindless entertainment type mood. No thought required. Felt like an R rated Nickelodeon or Cartoon Network movie."
Guns Akimbo,29-Feb-20,"I can't believe how stupid this film is. The story is totally predictable. If a male does it, they're stupid and incompetent. If a female does it, they're a ninja warrior. This is WOKE on steroids. If I could give this steaming piece of trash a 0, I would.Daniel Radcliffe is either a neutered sack or taking himself too seriously as an actor. Samara Weaving as Nix was awful, one dimensional. It's a sign of her acting chops when she didn't push back on her trash role.The jokes miss the mark. The film is either by incompetent writers, or, it's meant to be so bad that it's funny. In reality, it's neither.Save your time. This is the WORST film I have seen in a long time. Just say no to this trash."
Guns Akimbo,02-Mar-20,"Its one of those high octane thrill ride type of films but it feels like it was made by high schoolers, for high schoolersThe way the film is marketed it made me think of Crank.
The Co-Director of Crank said regarding a potential third film:
""The one thing that I won't do is sort of like a cheap, boring, tame version of the Crank movie,"" Taylor proclaimed.Which is exactly what this is,
this film is so poorly writen,
It proposes a world somewhat like ours and a protagonist thrown into a situation he is way out of his depth in, but unfortunately he's an idiot.I love films like Crank and Upgrade which have this crazy premise and you just have to sit back and enjoy without taking anything to seriously, however they are written so damn well they define the genre
which thrives on the unexpected and how you never know whats coming next,With this film the main character makes such mind numbingly stupid decisions at the start of the film and those decisions later obviously make rather predictable consequences its just hard to find him worth giving a damn about,characters talk forever or stand stupidly until they get shot regardless of having numbers or the upper hand.It's predictable, god is it predictable. the special effects and indoor gunfights never quite feel like anythings real, it just seems off, its a great fun idea but only if done well, unfortunately watching this feet like a chore. other films have done similar things but far better."
Guns Akimbo,02-Mar-20,"Absolute waste of screen time. It was dumb, it was not funny, it was pure cringe and action scenes sucked big time."
Guns Akimbo,28-Feb-20,"Holy CRAP! This was AMAZING!
The action was absolutely epic, reminded me of the insanity of Crank, mixed with the action of John Wick, the dark humor of Deadpool, and the plot from the TV Series Chosen
I went into it expecting nothing at all... and oh my gosh. This was the best movie Ive seen in quite some time. Highly, highly entertaining.
My one & only complaint was the tattooed guy; he was a bit much.
Other than that, I loved it.
10/10 stars"
Guns Akimbo,01-Mar-20,"Fun ride, good shootem up movie, with a great soundtrack."
Guns Akimbo,29-Feb-20,"No sense, so many errors, no connection, the story has not a message or doesn't make sense, just sell it for the actors?! come on guys"
Guns Akimbo,29-Feb-20,"1 Star for getting people together and creating a film. Another for all the actors and crew members that showed up on time to make it (that take a work ethic).After that, this is a film made by a couple of nine year olds who somehow got their hands on Millions of production dollars!This film is trite and boring, showing the same tired scheme of that seems to be on our collective; mental and real-life merry-go-round for who knows how long?It's terrible, that's the bottom line. Just throw some 80's or 90's tracks over shooting soulless, empty characters - like a video game, and you'll have a hit! Give me a break."
Twilight,20-Feb-20,I think this movie suffered from lack of a good script and bad acting.
Twilight,26-Nov-08,"That was my interpretation of this weekend that I had to endure working at my movie theater, all these little hormone crazed brace wearing under developed young girls who I think would've just about died with the anticipation of seeing Twilight, I'm not kidding, I personally witnessed a twelve year old say that she wanted to have Robert Pattinson's baby. OK, so how I saw the movie, my sister, ironically my older sister has been just raving about the Twilight series with her friends and told me that I have to read these books, after weeks of bugging me with it, I finally broke down and read them. Actually it's kind of a fun series, it reminded me of the same love that I had for the TV series Buffy the vampire Slayer when I was a young teen. But of course she has to take me to the midnight premiere with 100,000 crazed fans who were knocking each other down and crawling all over each other just to see a movie.Bella Swan has always been a little bit different, never caring about fitting in with the trendy girls at her Phoenix high school. When her mother remarries and sends Bella to live with her father in the rainy little town of Forks, Washington, she doesn't expect much of anything to change. Then she meets the mysterious and beautiful Edward Cullen. Intelligent and witty, he sees straight into her soul. Soon, Bella and Edward are swept up in a passionate and decidedly unorthodox romance. Edward can run faster than a mountain lion, he can stop a moving car with his bare hands - and he hasn't aged since 1918. Like all vampires, he's immortal. But he doesn't have fangs, and he doesn't drink human blood.So, my opinion about Twilight the movie... honestly, it's average, it's my junior high romance with a vampire. I hate, beyond hate to say this, I'm a hypocrite for saying this, but because I read the book before I saw the movie, I had this completely different interpretation of what the characters look like and how they say certain lines. Twilight the movie made me laugh more than anything simply because of the actors, Robert and Kristen are not bad actors, but the way they talked, I just couldn't take their ""love"" seriously. Peter Facinelli who played Carlisle Cullen, Edward's father, was exactly how I pictured and pulled in the best performance of the film. Is it worth the watch, absolutely if you're a fan of the books, otherwise, I would say if you just wanna see this movie, I recommend the matinée price because honestly, I think I may have lost my hearing after this weekend of the none stop screams from crazed teens.5/10"
Twilight,01-Dec-08,"This review may contain spoilers. You've been warned. Twilight was a terrible film adaption of a, let's face it, mediocre novel. I went into the theater with an open mind, not expecting brilliance, but expecting to be entertained. Well, I guess I was technically entertained since I laughed throughout most of the movie. Sadly, I wasn't laughing at purposely funny moments. I was laughing at the awkward ""acting"" of the actors and the terrible dialogue.Now this is where it gets tricky: Do we blame the screenwriter or the author? The movie made me realize just how corny the book's dialogue was. I found myself rolling my eyes, when I wasn't laughing, at every word out of the actor's mouth. Especially the dialogue between Edward and Bella. Now, the dialogue could have been over looked if the actors were able to deliver them. Alas, whoever decided to do casting for this film decided to cast every ""actor"" with the acting ability of a toaster. Now, a toaster is a inanimate object and therefore cannot act. Get the hint? What made me laugh the hardest was at the end of the movie when Bella's mother decides to inform Phil VIA TEXT MESSAGE that Bella is alright. I was so shocked that she was really texting him that I turned to my friend and whispered ""Bella's okay, L-O-L"". Really, though. Text messages? I would think that informing your potential spouse of your child's well being would warrant a phone call at least.Now, I have to point out the scene where Edward decides to flash Bella the goods. He want's to educate her in the ways of the vampire. He cannot go out into sunlight NOT because he'll burn or turn to dust, but because he turns into a failed children's art project. Reading the scene in the book I already knew whoever turned the book into a film was going to have issues with the scene. However, I really thought they'd aim for something above spraying Robert Pattinson with water then dumping craft store glitter on him. I didn't even notice the ""sparkles"" at first. My friend turned to me and commented ""The sun hits him and he gets gross and sweaty?"" because, let's face it, that's what he looked like. Damp and dirty. Oh baby, I can hardly contain myself! I could go on and nit pick at everything, but I'm just going to wrap it up and say this movie was awful and I'm disappointed in the screenwriter as well as the director. I feel like Hardwicke was too focused on making the mise-en-scene beautiful and aesthetically pleasing, which is all well and good, but in doing so she over looked her cast of actors who would probably get over looked at a high school play audition with the way they displayed their acting abilities in this movie. Though, maybe I take back the part of being disappointed in the screenwriter since you can only do so much with the source material you're handed.BRING ON THE TWILIGHT FANS! I CAN TAKE THEM! *Shields at maximum power!*"
Twilight,19-Nov-08,"This is just one person's opinion. No need to get angry, in fact I'd like you to convince me I'm wrong.The movie is missing the magic. Edward appeared on screen and I swooned. He opened his mouth and I cringed. Edward is strong and confident. He wasn't a whiney, smitten child. In love yes, but brooding and in pain. Bella was delicate, not just dry and indifferent. This Bella lacked emotion maybe even a soul-who is she? She didn't feel like the yearning, thoughtful Bella I had imagined. I wished she needed to be protected. This version can take care of her own business--and I'm not sure how bad she wants to be with Edward, or why for that matter. Maybe if she narrated her emotions would have been more pronounced. Don't get me wrong, the actors' chemistry is very evident, they should get married and have melodramatic children. But was the film from Bella's perspective or not? The changing pov was off-putting. This film proves that Meyer's pages and pages are what bring this story and Edward and Bella's love to life.The TONE was completely lost in the book to script to screen translation. The story is supposed to be a song that takes you to another world, one where vampires and werewolves exist. The story is an intoxicating melody. Here we're presented with a boy-band pop song sung by kids who think of themselves as classically trained Opera singers. PICK ONE. Be a chart-topping, America's Top 40 or be the haunting, dangerous lullaby I think a lot of fans were looking for.Speaking of boy band...the screen version of Jacob Black is one ""Bye Bye Bye"" from being the lead singer in Over-Produced-Axe-Wearing-Guy-Group 2008. Jacob, in my mind, is earthy. He's a guy's guy and gets his hands dirty fixing cars and building stuff. Jacob always left me feeling like he was wise beyond his years, a smitten kitten of course, but I always felt that he was more dynamic than this cute little wig-wearing version. I always felt this sense of history and quiet power. This version wears Abercrombie (and randomly appears from behind trees apparently...you'll see).The cast was quite OK for me. I did feel bad watching them try to deliver the lines they were given. I get that this is a vampire-romance movie, but honestly. The script is dripping in gooey, sticky, melted, mixed cheeses. OK, so it's fantastical, but to slap me in the face with Gouda and Brie every other frame is just insulting. Cheese aside, Charlie was great. His timing was spot on. Carlisle played the part, but the caked-on white makeup so completely distracting. Esme-- I wanted to crawl up onto her lap and have her tell me bedtime stories. Love it. Alice... that's her on that screen. A little bouncier and she's perfect. Jasper-- freakishly creepy and pained, loved it. When he comes out of his shell and plays more than the wide-eyed silent sidekick, I'm all over it. Those who doubted Reed need to reconsider. Rosalie is freaking hot and one sassy vamp. Emmett...holy crap, on the money (call me). Jessica is the best casting job in life...Mike, however...really?I know that this is just a movie. Film is a different medium than books. We get to create the world from a book but people get to interpret for us on screen, I know. I just wish it wasn't so far off base for me. I wanted nothing more than to enjoy it. I think I'm going to remember the series the way I imagined it and set this version aside. My oil canvas painting to their Polaroid. Who's melodramatic now? This girl.Here's hopping they make a choice for the next one: teen scene or dark love story so audiences know what they're getting into. Teenie Boppers are quite loyal, perhaps bubblegum will beef up their box office."
Twilight,21-Nov-08,"To preface this review, I read all four Twilight books in one weekend (last weekend, actually) when I picked the first one up at the airport, and could not put it down. I zipped through the other three and went to the midnight screening on opening day. To say the least, I was captivated by Twilight (and I'm in my 20s...).I was anxious to see the movie because, like so many other people, I felt really invested in Bella and Edward's story. Not only that, but I love the vampire premise - it just never gets old, especially when you put a new spin on it, as Meyer did in her books. The events of each book really ran together for me, so in a way, I felt like a non-Twilighter coming into this film. I really didn't care if the movie deviated from the book - in fact, I was kind of hoping it would, since you can't expect a book to translate directly to the screen. I heard a lot of serious Twilight teens complaining about ""major things"" missing when I left the theater, but I honestly didn't notice any major omissions.Overall, the film was better than I expected (based on previews, I expected it to be extremely cheesy, low-budget, and awkwardly filmed). It definitely grew on me as it went on, especially Pattinson's performance. His introduction was extremely awkward - not sure if that was Hardwicke's fault or Pattinson's acting. In any case, as soon as he settled into his character, he was absolutely captivating. Stewart plays a great brooder, and she certainly did that here. I loved the scenes with her father; in my opinion, these were some of the gems of the movie.The romance between Edward and Bella, which was obviously the crux of the film, was fueled by their chemistry, but not much else. Where was the development?! I really wish Hardwicke or the screenwriter or somebody had taken more time to delve into the roots of their relationship. It all just happened way too fast. I feel like this happened because of the James story, which to me was almost completely unnecessary (yeah, I know, it's a big part of the book and obviously needs to be here). But even so, the film would have been a more moving romance, and probably a more poignant, emotional film, if that cheesy, goofy subplot hadn't existed.Hardwicke dealt exceptionally well with teen angst, which was evident in the high school shots. Unfortunately, she really struggled with the vampire side of things. I have to put most of the blame on the director because the characters were all spot-on, very well-acted and well-cast. I also think a higher budget would have done wonders for this movie, and I'm hoping that becomes a reality for the sequel. The special effects were embarrassingly bad, and nearly ruined the movie.Overall, I enjoyed ""Twilight"" for what it was - a romance that probed the timeless dilemma of wanting what you can't have (and despite Meyer's Mormon beliefs, this whole series is basically a metaphor for sex). It makes for an interesting, compelling story, and I expect more from the sequels, because the potential is certainly there."
Twilight,21-Nov-08,"NOTE: This review is the fair and unbiased opinion of someone with extremely little knowledge of the Twilight series. I watched the movie with a few die hard fans who I talked to after the movie, and I will work some of their thoughts into the review.Another much loved book series has been brought to life in the form of Twilight, which despite having nothing in common with the Harry Potter series, will undoubtedly draw comparisons because of the furor and craze surrounding it. The main difference between the two, however, is that the Harry Potter films are generally good and solid films. Twilight, despite having done a couple things right, is not.As a story, I will admit, Twilight is very catchy and interesting. Now I see what all the hype is about. If I was a young girl, I would go nuts over this stuff too. It's not just a vampire and a human falling in love with each other, but because of the two leads, it's one of the best on screen romances of the decade. This, however, is severely hurt by the fact that Twilight boasts easily some of the worst writing and editing I've ever seen. Let's not forget about the horrid VFX and pasty makeup, either. It's one of the cheesiest films of the year, and can definitely be put in the category of ""so bad it's ALMOST good"". Yes, I just invented that category.The 'allure' of the film appears to be the character played by Robert Pattinson, who ironically was previously known for his role in the Harry Potter series. Pattinson succeeded there and he more than succeeds again, as he more than fit the bill for what he needed to do with the character. Most actors would believe the only requirement of the character is to be good looking, but Pattinson takes it a step further and makes Edward Cullen very likable, trustworthy, and in the end, a good hero for the audience. Kristen Stewart is sort of the queen of not showing facial expressions, so she's perfect for the role of the awkward teen Bella Swann. However, there were sometimes where her lack of emotion bothered me.Our supporting players...Well, none of them are noteworthy like Pattinson is. The villain of the film is lame, cheesy, and played by an actor I can't take seriously. Nikki Reed is probably the best as Rosalie, Edward's 'sister', and the antagonistic vibe felt from her adds a different side to the movie.Okay, I don't really know what possessed the writer of this screenplay to make it so horrible (was it the source material?), because the dialog is just so bad that I laughed at serious moments. There's a lot of intentional humor, mostly in the beginning when Bella and Edward feel like awkward teens in love. I guess the movie moved along okay, because I wasn't bored at all. I was either laughing at how stupid the dialog was, laughing at some of the mildly funny jokes, or getting pulled in by the electric chemistry between Stewart and Pattinson.That, folks, is the reason most people will be able to sit through this movie. The chemistry between the two leads, romantically and sexually, is amazing. In this respect, Pattinson and Stewart are perfectly cast and it makes me wonder if they could end up together in real life some day. I was very surprised by how much I liked seeing their one on one scenes, as cheesy and bad as the VFX and editing are.As far as these visual effects go, I've seen a few vampire movies in my day. I'm going to assume director Catherine Hardwicke has seen a few. Well, she needs to watch a few more. Her fight scenes are horribly choreographed, terribly shot, and lack the intensity required to successfully rouse her audience. I could almost notice the wires the actors flew across on. I noticed a ton of errors with the editing as well, such as basic stuff like mouths moving and no words coming out, and words coming out when no mouths were moving. The fight scene at the end has wicked bad editing too, as the sound mixing also suffers as well.All in all, with Twilight, as bad a movie as it may be, I couldn't help but stay interested in it because of the electric chemistry between the leads. That alone kept me in the seat the whole time. It is technically one of the worst films of the year, but the entertainment factor in the above respect keeps it out of the company of movies like Disaster Movie and College. I was actually lucky to see it with some of the fans of the book, and all of them (5) described the movie as a 'disappointment' and that the film went 'half way' with some subplots, either starting and dropping them, or randomly starting them halfway through an individual subplot. They were not happy at all with this movie, but agreed on one thing: Robert Pattinson was the perfect Edward Cullen. I'll agree with them on all those points and say that Twilight is exactly what I thought it would be: so bad it's ALMOST good."
Twilight,21-Nov-08,"I have read the books, and the first thing I noticed was that the story wasn't about a plot line at all. It's about the characters and what's going on with them. Stephenie Meyer focuses on interaction, not on dialog, plot, or setting, which is fine. But it makes for a bad movie.Surprisingly, Twilight wasn't that bad of a film. I expected it to be much worse. As I said, there's very little plot or dialog in the book, so it's hard to make a convincing film. They had to over act looks to try and communicate without many words. I could probably count on one hand the lines in the movie.Other than the over acting, it wasn't bad. There were some very good moments and some very ""eh"" moments. But overall I would recommend it to Twilight fans. I probably won't ever want to see it again, but it's okay at midnight with some school friends who like it or something."
Twilight,05-Mar-20,"Not completely sure if this should be considered a parody for the vampire sub-genre or an adaptation of a couple of teens meet in public school one of them Edward who belongs to a vampire clan and the other is a human Bella who stays with her dad, they both develop an attraction towards each other.Least to say about Twilight is this, it was excruciating!...a bad joke from the beginning to the end. The story is too lame and too shallow, which can be described as a clichéd teen romance that plays out in a complete opposite manner of any folklore or even a decent vampire adaption. The casting choices are weird, like they decided to combine all the ugly actors/actress in 1 movie! In my opinion, most people miss good looks with fame and propaganda, Kristen Stewart, Robert Pattinson and Taylor Lautner are facially ugly! remove the fame and publicity then put them to work in any convenience store and people won't even look at them twice.The acting was over all bad, the actors facial expression and eye movement so weird and bad as if they are smelling onions while shooting the whole movie! the makeup is a laughable disaster as if you are watching movies acted by clowns...clearly the director and the makeup department don't know the difference between having a pale skin and applying a clown makeup, not to mention the ugly wig of Taylor Lautner. The VFX is laughable with all the fake flying around, goes without mentioning the joke effect of vampires under sunlight, no fangs and human like bite marks! It's an over all disastrous movie and the fact that Twilight had some kind of success it can only prove how shallow the average audience mentality has become."
Twilight,29-Aug-09,"This movie was terrible. If you read the books and watched the movie and liked it, you didn't pay attention to detail. Bella is supposed to be some klutzy, pale, sarcastic girl from Arizona. She is supposed to be a very giving person and puts others before her. She ALSO is supposed to be more on the emotional side of things, thats her awkward trait. Edward is supposed to be very protective of her and very suave. He looks even more awkward than she did!! He is a vampire, they are (supposedly) these charming, witty people. He is also very sarcastic with her.The movie messed up some one the things. Dates and time. In the book Bella says she went to Forks every summer until she finally told her dad that she didn't like it there so they vacationed in California instead... In the movie they messed that up. Jacob is supposed to tell her all about Edward and his family, she flirts with him to get the information. Where the heck did Lauren go?! Jessica (in the movie) was supposed to be a combination of both. Book Jessica was phony. She pretended to be nice and friendly with Bella because she noticed that EVERYBODY liked the new girl. Lauren just hated Bella.Kristen Stewert is apparently the greatest actress of our time... HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?!?!?! She doesn't show emotion, her scared voice and her happy voice sound the same. The only good scene in the movie was when she went to find James. And she blinked, looked around way too much. SHe bit her lip (which is a quality of Bella, she took it way too far.) and breathed heavily. Bella goes through random bursts of excitement in the movie, especially when she finds that Edward stayed the night as promised.. The first kiss happens after the Meadow, not in her room. Victoria doesn't talk until the third book. Rosalie only talks once or maybe twice in the first book.Alice and Jasper have a more emotional Connection. Emmet and Rosalie have a more physical romance. Jasper comforts Bella a heck of a lot more in the book. ""I know what your thinking. And your wrong. You are worth it."" (He said that to Bella after the whole thing with James.)THE ONLY GOOD THING IS THE MUSIC. I would recommend the soundtrack, it is awesome."
Twilight,07-Dec-09,"There's no doubting that I'm not a member of the intended market for this film (a good thirty years too old, alas) and it's equally true that I'm also of the wrong gender, but the phenomenal success of this film is puzzling to me. It's quite difficult to make an uninteresting film about vampires – although quite a few have succeeded – but this, the first of a franchise, set amongst a high school milieu recognisable to its target demographic, is as dull as the palette director Catherine Hardwicke chooses to paint her picture with.While I like vampire flicks, I don't really like films that play too much with accepted vampire lore. Twilight doesn't so much play with its conventions as totally re-invent them for its own somewhat cynical purposes. Twilight's vampires have no fear of daylight – they just turn a pretty silver colour when exposed to direct sunlight – which means they can interact with humans, go to school, hold down a job – as a doctor, no less; they have no fangs, no fear of water or holy symbols, and they don't feed on the blood of humans, choosing instead to chow down on wild animals. In fact, in many ways they're a typical all-American family: prick your thumb and suck the blood and you'd be as much of a vampire as these guys. (Perhaps I should amend that last sentence to typical dysfunctional All-American family).Of course, this makes the prospect of becoming a vampire a not unappealing one; after all, you get to live forever and, if like the lead vampire here, you get turned in your teens, you get to spend eternity appealing to pretty girls of a similar age. This being aimed at teens, there's a strong identification with the trials of an outsider. The young heroine is the new girl in town whose father is the local cop, and the vampires are outsiders because of who they are. All of which makes them appealing to teenagers who feel the world doesn't understand them and who are subsequently unsure of their place in it.To be fair to the author, it's at least a fairly unique idea, and the Twilight books have clearly struck a chord with young teenagers. The film is reasonably well made, and while it won't make a particularly enjoyable experience for most adults, it at least doesn't cut corners in the belief that it doesn't have to try as hard simply because it's aimed at a less demanding than average target audience."
Twilight,14-Apr-09,first i was expecting something good from this movie...as this movie was on top... for more than two weeks...when i watched this movie..the worst movie experience i ever had..i was expecting some action as they were strong..and...powerful... but...not even one fight scene...oh man....i watched the whole movie just to look at Kristen Stewart that s it....the movie was made for girls with weird fantasy in their mind.... i bet u can put Robert Pattinson in a porn movie...it would collect him plenty of money...than this stupid movie.....and the story sounds like it was copied from a book with some pages missing...and lets talk bout the actors....did they hire them from eBay...????
Twilight,22-Nov-08,"I would give this movie no stars.. This movie is pathetic. I mean so pathetic. The acting was awful! The movie starts well, but once they introduce the Cullens its pretty much downhill. Ashley Greene looks good as Alice, Jackson Rathbone looks constipated as Jasper, a wooden plank would have been a more convincing Edward. Robert Pattinson deserves the Razzie, second thought, his acting is so horrible that a razzie is like honoring him. Vampires are supposed to be scary, when Edward scales trees he acts like a monkey, move over Kong! The baseball match looks like Super Mario Sluggers on steroids! Horrible..The scene where Edward glitters is pathetic. It looks someone dumped some glitter on him.. On the other hand Charlie Swan and Jacob were spot on.Over all the director tried too hard and lost it all. I strongly believe someone with more experience should direct a high profile film like this. This movie doesn't appeal as a Vampire movie or as a Romantic movie. Its pathetic.. Jury"
Twilight,26-Feb-09,"Now do not be offended by any of this, this is just my opinion.No I am not a rabid Twilight hater. I read the books, yes all of them. I thought they were interesting. Not very original, well thought out, or well written, but decent enough to read. I had several problems with this movie. It's not just the cast. Though I think Cam Gigandet did an excellent job as James. Okay my main problem with the cast was not really who they picked. I guess it boils down to the fact that Bella and Edward really are not that interesting. Is it so much to ask for a heroine who isn't so whiney and can take care of herself. Or maybe a vampire who isn't broody and boring and doesn't SPRAKLE! ((sorry that just bugs the **** out of me)) I think if they had stuck more to the actually book it would have been better. Granted, not by much, but it would have at least gotten 5 stars from me.I do like the cinematography. The movie is gorgeous visually, and as i stated before the acting was not terrible. I would have picked different people for most of the cast, but thats me. I do have one more thing to say before i end this.RABID TWIlIGHT FANS NEED TO CALM DOWN!!! ITS JUST A BOOK AND MOVIE SERIES!! don't take the fact that people don't like it to heart. if you like it, thats great."
Twilight,19-Nov-08,"I'm an avid Twilight reader and stalker (yes I went to Hot Topic tour.) I can't remember a time when I was SO anxious and excited to see a movie. I just saw Twilight at a screening in San Francisco on 11/17. I left the theatre feeling..indifferent.First of all, I knew the movie was not going to be based exactly to the books but at the same time it kind of hurts me to say that it just wasn't good. ~sigh I felt that the director Catherine tried to bring her indie elements into the Hollywood style movie that just didn't work. The opening scene with the deer was alright, but I was just about to laugh out loud when the movie got to Edward and Bella finally acknowledging what Edward truly was. This was the biggest issue I had. I didn't think viewers were able to experience the intensity of Bella and Edward relationship. I wouldn't believe that Bella was ready to place her undying pledge to go vamp at the end. The scene was so choppy, where it felt like the scene was full of greatest hits of one liners all cram into this one scene. It wasn't the turning point as where it should have been. The movie was clearly not based on romance, which is the ultimate theme of the book. The movie hastily breezed through the courtship development to finally get to the lingering action sequence.I like Robert but he just couldn't pull off a convincing Edward. His reaction to Bella in Biology class was just laughable. Again Catherine trying to pull the artsy camera cuts--- silly, silly. Jasper's reaction was humorous also.Edward's showing Bella who he was in the sun was not remarkable. His body hardly glisten. Couldn't they get Britney's Swarovski body suit from her ""Toxic"" video? The movie nicely brought out Rosalie's dislike for Bella. Alice was very convincing and good. Carlise was attractive and fitting.I was surprised by the diverse student body of Forks. I liked Jessica a lot. It was hard to see her as the small minded character as how she was written in the book.All in all, this movie wasn't made for fans of the book, but to lure moviegoers into (hopefully) the film franchise.Little things that could have been included in the movie to make the readers happy wasn't included. Such as why couldn't Bella wear the blue V neck sweater when meeting the Cullens for the first time? Why couldn't Bella attack Edward on the onset of their first kiss? Why couldn't Edward's couch be black? Why did James bite Bella on her forearm and not her hand? As a Twilighter, I think I may go see it again just to see if my reactions change, but I wouldn't recommend this film to any non-Twilighters."
Twilight,19-Nov-08,"Don't spend your time comparing it to the book. If you just sit there comparing the book and the movie, you'll take the fun out of the movie itself. If you are a book reader, reading Midnight Sun really helps understand Edward's reactions and such. This is the best movie I've seen that has stayed the closest to the book as much as it could. I do understand why they made a few changes to please some of the moviegoers who haven't read the book. It ties things in a different but acceptable way. I loved how they interpreted the book. I understand that it was a teen movie so of course there was a little cheesiness at times. But hey, the book is geared towards a teen audiences regardless of the wide age range that actually reads it. I think Summit did a good job and should make New Moon."
Twilight,06-Jan-09,"""How Old Are You?"" ""17"" ""How long?"" ""A While"" ""What are you?"" ""A vampire... are you afraid?"" ""...No""This is the perfect example of how the script is layed out in Twilight. If a script's IQ is judged by how many words are in a sentence, this movie would be mentally unfit to be in public. This movie is truly poorly written. I wouldn't mind the movie as much if it didn't have such poor dialog. Since this is a dialog driven movie, I expect a good script, but it was god-awful. This movie hardly had any good vampire action. Hell, the vampires didn't even have any fangs.I realize that the books are well written and popular, but the company who produced Twilight better get a better writer. Otherwise the franchise will fall extremely flat, and all the teenagers watching the movies will wake up... very soon."
Twilight,31-Mar-09,"First of all I'd like to say that not many movies ever accomplish the difficult task of doing their books justice, but this movie basically made the books look ridiculously lame and cheesy. Anyone who watched the movie first hoping for some insight to the books will NOT want to read the books afterwards because the love story seems so unrealistic..while the reason the books are so popular is because they SEEM like the love between Edward and Bella could actually happen in real life! Until the baseball scene, there was really no action, and the movie just kind of dragged along. Once the ""bad"" vampires came into play, things finally started to get interesting. I think they should've included more action like this throughout the entire movie to keep viewers attention."
Twilight,21-Nov-08,"Okay, just got out of theatre and let me begin by saying I am a high school girl who went in a big group of friends. I have read all the books and was just interested in seeing how they adapted the story to film (1), and also how well the film by itself as just a movie (2).1) Adaptation: almost spot on. In essence, the movie stuck close to the book and probably pleased the series fanatics as far as storyline. The part of the adaptation that I felt was off was the casting, as many people have commented on. The movie didn't feel: intimate, romantic, fairytale-like, whirlwind, passionate, etc. Aka all the adjectives that describe the books and make them so popular. The characters for the most part ""looked"" the role, but not all of them carried it out. Robert was dashingly handsome (although, not what I pictured in my mind), and it seemed like he had a good chance of taking the role to the next level. Unfortunately, I think I would like him better if he just froze with his Ray-Bans on in his suit...because that would be more entertaining than the way he delivered his lines. Bella was another big problem. Kristen perfectly looked the role but she came out being cold instead of passionate, unemotional instead of head-over-heels lusting after this guy.2)As a movie I can say this honestly stunk. :( It moved along choppily, the film editing was all wrong, the soundtrack was wack, and the acting was just not there. Apart from knowing and loving these characters, if you have not read the book you will be asking yourself why there is a 90 minute movie focused on these characters. The build-up, turning point, climax, and resolution were all weak. It is never a good sign when the sold out theatre is laughing at all the wrong times. One to point out would have to be Edward's ""constipation"" reaction when he first sees Bella. I know that the reaction is hard to convey on film but..come on.So there it is. Love the books. From page to film this was a wasted opportunity. The intention was there but the vision was not."
Twilight,23-Mar-09,"'Twilight' was one of the most hilarious movies I've seen in awhile; at least that's how it started. Reminding me a lot of 'The Happening,' I found myself laughing out loud during the first half and then simply hating life during the last half. I have heard this was meant for teenage girls. Fine, I get it and I'm not one. However, how I wish more for them. They deserve so much more. It's absolutely no wonder why this movie dropped its audience 62% on weekend 2. There are so many points to cover for this two-hour tragedy, I'll at least attempt to cover the incredibly bad aspects: awful, laugh-out-loud acting and dialogue/narration, horrible soundtrack, special effects were downright amusing, the bad (""Johnny Suede"") hairdos and the desperate attempts at a franchise  let's just set up every scene to set the stage for the inevitable part II, III, etc. I'm just going to assume the people playing the parts (it's too nice to call them actors) read the original material. Well, the ""I can't live without you"" wooden dialogue seems like they are seriously reading from the book rather than playing the parts. And one of the worst aspects of this film was the fact that after all the lovey-dovey stares, (oh, God, the constant stares Bella and Edward give each other. STOP, please, God, STOP!) they seemed to forget one of the most basic elements in any plot  the adversary. OK. Well, let's introduce one 3/4s into the film in the shape of Brad Pitt. Why does he want Bella? To get back to the family? Why? Oh, I guess I'll have to wait for Part II. And yes, I plan on waiting in line for that film. I'm always in the mood for a good laugh or dozen."
Twilight,28-Mar-11,"(this might contain some spoilers) If there is one thing that I hate the most, Its twilight. seriously, who had ever heard of vampires that sparkles in the sunlight? I would rather watch Dracula then this. this film and Edward Cullan are a disgrace to vampires everywhere. How dare he call himself a Nosferatu(Romanian for vampire). Dracula will easily kick Edwards scrawny butt. Stephenie Meyer has ruined vampires for us all. No thanks to her, there are obsessed fangirls all around. honestly, vampires aren't what they use to be anymore. If you are a fan of vampires, don't watch this movie. It is not worth watching, because Stephenie Meyers has desecrated the legacy of vampires."
Twilight,11-Apr-09,"To be honest to you, this isn't a movie at all. I must admit that this movie is dedicated to girls only. I don't know why it's become so popular among girls. But to be honest this is really awful me and even worst movie I've ever seen. Acting was awful, Script was written terribly. What is this. I waste my money even my valuable time watching this awful movie. I'm suggestion don't buy the DVD, just rent it. I was really disappointed with the movie and not looking to watch the sequel. I really recommended you to rent the DVD not to buy. Save your valuable money to buy another good movies. So overall due to some effort they've putted. I'm only be able to rate this movie 1/10."
Twilight,17-Mar-09,"Are they for real? All I saw was some lipstick-wearing-Volvo-driving mama's boy make ridiculous statements about how DANGEROUS he was. The whole moronic high-school romance destroyed my vampire fantasy and the mythical creatures' good name for that matter. And the dialogue? ""I love you..."" ""No, I love you more..."" Please! It's not entirely the director's fault, the actors helped a lot and there's only so much you can do with a book like that. Peter Facinelli must be really getting desperate. Maybe I'm just cynical, but this soap opera drove me insane. Hollywood had such great relationship with vampires. What the hell happened?"
Twilight,27-Dec-08,"*** YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED< POSSIBLE SPOILERS**** You know how when they figure out a bad shipment of food has been sent out they do a national recall? Well they should nationally recall this film because it is horrible. The only good thing that came out of it was the fact it peaked my interest to read the books. I figured there was no way the books could be as bad as the movie with the huge amount of fan base they had. Where was the love, the fire, or for better lack of appropriate term, the bite. Stewart as Bella was just pathetic, Pattinson as Edward was demeaning and why wasn't Alice given more screen time? It is a shame these actors were forced to endorse a horrible film. When I read the books I wanted to be Bella. I believed I could be because she was shy, average and had no pretense at all. The movie Bella? I wouldn't be her in a million years. Could she not put two full sentences together? I mean good god I won't care if I never hear um again as long as I live. She was not convincing in this role. Even the fight scene with her was awful. All the screaming gave me a headache and when she was ""dying"" the way her eyes crossed was laughable. I mean come on, who ""dies"" with their eyes crossed? Edward was just awful. I fell in love with the Book Edward. He makes you wish and dream of finding someone to love you as much as he loves Bella. The movie Edward? AWFUL!!!In the book Edwards voice is magical in the movie it gives you a headache. Next time pick someone who can speak English fluently. In an interview Pattinson says that he did not practice his English accent for this movie. Well guess what it really shows and you could have used some practice. I hope they hire him a voice coach for New Moon and Stewart some acting lessons. On a positive note, I love Charlie. He is so sweet and I loved the actor that played James. He would def. scare me. If you love the books, skip the movie. It barely follows the story line and the books are a better investment. Time and money wise."
Twilight,29-Nov-08,"The only reason I never read Twilight when it first came out, long before it was popular, was because I read a book review stating that it was a clichéd and traditionaltwo things that I hate more than anything. The only reason I watched the movie was so I could actually understand what the vast majority of America was talking about when they raved about it. I came with low expectations and an open mind. I reassured myself, after all, I do enjoy love stories when they're original and memorable, so this couldn't be too bad, right? Three hours later, I left the theater feeling as if I was just released from a torture device and struggled desperately to my car on weak legs that just walked through hell on earth. Is my last sentence melodramatic? Maybe, but compared to the cheesy melodrama that IS the plot of Twilight, me sitting through that atrocious movie looks downright life-or-death.From the first scene to the last, at least 1/3 of every scene in the movie is filled with nothing but characters staring at each other or at various things. I've never thought I would have to sit here and actually type up a complete paragraph complaining about the amount of staring in a movie, but, folks, the day has come. Bella meets Edward: they don't talk, they literally just stare. The vampire plot point is reveled: they stare. Bella is in a life-or-death situation: she stares at whatever is about to kill her. At one point, a car is ready to crush her, and what does she oh-so-realistically do? Stare at it.The acting is that hilariously bad. During the majority of the movie Bella has a look on her face that is a mix between being high and having an orgasmwhile staring. Edward, despite what the horny pre-teen girls (and middle-aged women) want to believe, is a walking self-parody. Cheesy lines (that he repeats over and over again), unintentionally cheesy lines (""I'm so hot, and that makes me a perfect killer!""), and did I mention he's supposedly hundreds of years old yet he still acts like an angsty-creepy-weird-virgin-guy? So, how was the story? It's based on a novel, so it has to have a plot, right? Wrong. Put simply, vampire romance is the most unoriginal idea ever to hit literature. Not to mention movies like Near Dark and Let the Right One In already beat the overused plot bloody on the big screen. Essentially, Twilight in one line is: boy and girl fall in love, boy must sacrifice everything for girl as she sits there like a pretty Barbie doll (and Kristen Stewart isn't even much to look at here), then they both commit. And while you're watching it, it seems even less interesting than that. There is zero entertainment value unless you're a hopelessly horny female who humps her pillow with images of Edward in her head, or you're a hopelessly pathetic male who just wants to impress his girlfriend because he can relate to a ""emotional love story"". I can't comment on the former, but, seriously, I'm a guy who likes love stories and this is NOT a love story. It's a traditionalist middle school English essay with flat characters and no plot other than: put two horny kids together, but appeal to the ""dark"" crowd by making it a vampire story . . . without even showing fangs.Other dishonorable mentions: 1) Twilight = Napoleon Dynamite - the humor + stupid subplots 2) The ""Restrain yourself, Edward, don't suck her blood!"" scene brings unintentional cheese to a new level 3) The movie never ends; two hours seems like eternity (in hell) 4) Baseball doesn't make edge-of-your-seat action 5) There is no action 6) There are no real vampires unless you count pretty-boys 7) Stephanie Myers completely screws up the vampire myths I almost feel sorry for Catherine Hardwicke. She's an amazing director, and she singlehandedly turned this stupid crap-fest into a well-done movie on a technical level, and everything else was out of her hands. But who would honestly turn down the money this movie would bring in? I don't blame her, I blame Stephanie Myers.I also feel sorry for the countless people who watch this and think it's a quality love story, thus never being exposed to the true love stories out there. What is Twilight? A horny, unoriginal, childish fantasies put into a movie. That, like always, wins mass reader, and now viewer, acclaim. I just wish one day popular fiction wasn't a synonym for retard fiction.0/10"
Twilight,21-Apr-11,"Keeping all cynicism about the popularity of the series aside, this film is honestly an extremely stupid movie. The production values are horrible (you would think that they would make the flying realistic) and the acting is nothing more than looking into each others eyes. The script is but a few throw-away love words that are meaningless and corny that, had it not been based on a bestselling book, no producer or director would have ever made.I tried, truly, to keep an open mind, but it was hard when the script and acting were so weak. Twilight was a very, very bad movie. The only reason I gave it two stars is because the director at least tries."
Amulet,27-Jul-20,"The title says it all. The acting was good, I think the story could have been more interesting, but the low-energy, life-support pace of this movie had me half asleep by the end.I appreciate some art-house, slow-burn movies, but this one fell short.[4/10]"
Amulet,25-Jul-20,"It's for fans of auteur horror like Hereditary and The Lighthouse. If you like these movies, like I do, you'll probably like this too. It definitely gets very weird, so if you like horror weirdness then this is for you. It's a 7 or 8 out of ten for these folks.If you mostly like only standard trope horror such as slasher movies and zombie movies this is unlikely to be your thing. You'll probably think it terrible and believe it to be 1 or 2 out of ten film."
Amulet,29-Jul-20,"I had heard great things about this film and last night settled down to watch it.
What a disaster, I don't know what it is with horror film directors but why do they have to make their films 'arty.'
What has happened to a straight scary horror movie?
This could have been such a good film if it was done as a scary film and not like some student trying to impress their tutor.
All in all it wasn't scary at all, the a ting was good but just good, there was a good story with it but that was it.
Just over an hour and a half of my life I won't get back.
Don't believe the hype, if you are going to watch it keep an open mind and don't read any reviews first."
Amulet,24-Jul-20,"Extremely unengaging. The plot seems to have no thrust to it. You're just watching at best passable actors wander about, occasionally witnessing generic horror tropes.I'd guess that's a side effect of stretching a 20 minute idea to a 100 minutes but I'm honestly not sure what the 20 minute idea is. I finished the movie, I understand all the events that took place, and I'm still left with a feeling that I didn't get something. It's like they chose to tell a fairly basic story in the most convoluted way possible. I have so many questions about the motivations and inconsistencies of characters and actions.At one point a plot twist happens. There are flashbacks to previous events and all that jazz. I admit to being confused, but only because I don't understand why that's a plot twist. It could have been presented as it really is and would have changed absolutely nothing. In fact it would make more sense that way!Imelda Staunton is great in her very short role and for the 3 minutes that the movie goes completely bananas it is entertaining, but for every good thing in this movie there is a scene that makes you laugh unintentionally for either coming out of nowhere or being done poorly. It's not so bad it's good, it's not entertaining."
Amulet,24-Jul-20,"A refugee soldier from an unnamed war, Tomaz (Secareanu) washes up in London, with no money and crippling PTSD, where a kindly nun (Staunton) sets him up as a live-in handyman for Magda (Juri), who is in turn caring for her decrepit mother. Everyone, inevitably, has grisly secrets that circle and threaten to consume them all, as Tomaz becomes increasingly convinced there are demonic forces at play.Of course, there are: grisly, suppurating horrors that are older than Tomaz's dented faith or his memories of standing guard at a forest check point when a terrified woman, Miriam (Papoulia), stumbles into his sanctuary. He's processing the sinister events that followed there while Magda teases him and pushes him away, leaving the question of sympathy unanswered.There's tension and sadness in the dance between Tomaz and Miriam, both fractured souls who seem to know no way to express even a fragment of happiness. Secareanu is less showy than Juri, who is given wilder limits as the frazzled and trapped nursemaid/daughter, even if he's never quite given the narrative framework to connect his younger and older selves. Yet together Mirian and Tomaz combine in their shared understanding of pain, and that's what's most meaningful here; at the same time, the slow-burn pagan gruesomeness and metaphysical horror never feels fully realized, like a highfalutin remake of The Lords of Salem without the B-movie verve. First-time writer/director Garai undoubtedly strikes a consistent mood of dread, amplified by Laura Bellingham's luxuriously squalid cinematography. Unfortunately, there's a lack of thematic coherence to her tale of dark magic, and a resolution that is neither as neat or satisfying as she seems to believe.It's the hints of a bigger world that never coalesce, a cosmology that never feels like world-building, and a smattering of well-executed creature effects that feel at odds with the brooding mood. Garai relies on a couple of tropes that feel culturally incomplete, like having the plot depend on a Catholic nun in contemporary Britain feels like a misplaced cliche (plus Staunton carries too much menace and malice to ever seem benevolent). Moreover, the abstraction of Tomaz - from somewhere Eastern European, potentially the Balkans, with all that implies about bloody history - feels too metaphorical to have the heft needed for the story. Worst of all, the fact that the key characters are all migrants fleeing conflict is used as set dressing, rather than cardinal motivation. It's like Garai can never work out whether she wants this to be a modern Gothic fantasy, or a contemporary horror with deeper social meaning, then falls afoul of excessive coincidence. The parts of the spell are all there, but the conjuring is incomplete."
Amulet,26-Jul-20,"This movie deserves a much higher score but I think it is a movie that people have trouble enjoying for at least 3 reasons.Firstly, it takes time and focus to actually follow the plot. It's not spoon feeding you. You have to pay attention and remember events and comments from earlier in the movie. It all ties together beautifully at the end but you have to be able to see it.Second, it takes a huge twist close to the end. If you don't get the plot, you won't like or understand the twist. I like this movie because it's one of those WTF movies that really leaves you thinking about it long after the movie. These are my favorite type of movies so I get why not everyone likes that.Third, I love horror. This is one of the freakiest horror films I have ever seen and I have seen hundreds. This is up there with Event Horizon in terms of spooky/revolting and unsettling horror. But it only comes in small bits. Most of the movie is psychological but here and there it has really great horror moments. Both ""shock/surprised"" horror and also that sort of OMG realization horror where you realize how horrific something is slowly and your eyes go wide.I hope more of you can watch this and enjoy it as much as I did."
Amulet,25-Jul-20,An abstract horror mostly. Little more context relating the two story lines would be good but it's visually stunning and gets more messed up right to the end. Some of the imagery will be stuck in my head for a while and it's been a long time since a film has done that. Disturbing stuff.
Amulet,25-Jul-20,"This is not a horror movie. Its a boring movie. Nothing happens, and its very confusing to watch. The fact that it is so confusing and so boring, just takes out the enjoyment of watching this crap. Dont waste your time with this. Its a complete waste of time."
Amulet,24-Jul-20,"Is it possible for someone to truly earn forgiveness if they refuse to forgive themselves? That's the question that looms over Amulet, the feature directorial debut of the actor Romola Garai, best known perhaps for her role in Atonement. Were that title not already taken, it would perfectly fit Amulet: ""Before your God, the ancients... They didn't believe that you could forgive yourself,"" confides the film's main character, Tomaz, in a tense moment of spiritual reflection and grief. ""It wasn't yours to give."" He wants absolution without the conviction to confront his wrongdoing-a struggle that drives at the very heart of this unsettling supernatural thriller.Tomaz, played by Alec of God's Own Country, is an itinerant day laborer living in a squatter's den on the outskirts of London. He's also a former soldier, and is plagued by guilt-stricken nightmares about his time as the lone sentry of a checkpoint in the center of an enormous, foggy forest. At night, he binds his hands with duct tape, as if afraid of what he might do in his sleep. After a fire forces this destitute man onto the street, he's taken in by the warm, generous Sister Claire (Vera Drake's Imelda Staunton), who offers him a solution: In exchange for free room and board, he'll work as a repairman and companion for Magda (Carla Juri), who's caring for her dying mother.Things are not as they seem, of course. Magda's mother is either possessed by something evil or is that evil herself-the distinction is never made clear. What is clear is that Tomaz's efforts to free Madga from her curse are an attempt to make up for past transgressions. Garai has described Amulet as ""feminist horror,"" and that makes more sense as the film goes on, slowly transforming from an eerie cerebral horror fantasy into a full-blown rape-revenge parable of cowardice and sin. It's never quite said aloud what Tomaz did during the war to cause him so much guilt and pain, but there's plenty of implication in his ascetic aloofness and furtive glances at Magda, before Garai reveals her hand to the audience in the final act. Sexually charged imagery and yonic symbolism abound: With every shot of a chaste white dress, blood-soiled bed sheet, or hand peeling apart the slit-opened innards of a dead fish, the film foreshadows the mounting physical tension between Tomaz and Magda.Given the film's feminist aspirations, it would be a mistake not to cite the immeasurable talents of its principally female cast. Given a much roomier role than the one she occupied in Denis Villeneuve's Blade Runner 2049, Juri makes Magda deeply compelling in her emotional inscrutability; her arc is just as complicated, if not more so, than Tomaz's-and it's further complicated by how Amulet inverts and plays with the dynamic of a supposed protector and his charge. Staunton, meanwhile, masterfully pulls back a veil of care-worn magnanimity to reveal the contempt and disdain seething beneath."
Amulet,26-Jul-20,"If you are looking for a gore feast or have the attention span of a flea this movie is not for you.With suburb acting, story, and production this movies is engaging from start to finish.This film does require you to actually watch it to get the most out of the subtleties through out that give you a sense of the characters conflicts and personalities.All in all a superb film"
Amulet,26-Jul-20,Itd boring makes me sleepy and its confusing. The whole plot doesnt make any sense
Amulet,25-Jul-20,Another man-hating film dressed up to look like a horror flick.
Amulet,24-Jul-20,"For the horror fans this movie Very bad and boring you'll waste your time , no story and nothing horror"
Amulet,29-Jul-20,"Guys...stop. Having a bunch of well-shot footage of forests and obnoxious experimental music doesn't make something a high quality horror film on par with things like Hereditary and The Lighthouse. If that surface level stuff is all you think it takes to make a movie intelligent and masterfully crafted, sorry, but you're not as clever as you're trying to make yourselves sound.There are many things that directors like Aster and Eggers do that make their movies rise far above ones like this, but let me just pick one, and arguably the most important one, THE PERFORMANCES OF THE CHARACTERS. You have to be absolutely kidding me if you're going to sit there trying to tell me that the actors in Amulet were anywhere close to well-directed, maximum effort performances from people like Willem Dafoe and Toni Collette. They aren't just on different floors, they're not even in the same building.I've seen much, much worse than Amulet, and I wouldn't even go as far as to call it a bad film, but I can't think of a single moment where Tomas or Magda made me think ""wow, what a great performance"". Hell, I can't even think of one that made me care about either of them. They're dreary characters in a dreary setting acting out dreary motions to fill up time until the entire effects budget is blown in the last 10 minutes, and yes, the director is obviously TRYING to convey something poignant with this unconventional story, but they just aren't selling it.""Weird + good cinematography"" does not automatically equal a great film.""Having an artistic vision + good intentions"" does not automatically equal a great film.It's a great effort, but it's not a great film. Wait five years to see if anyone's still talking about it, or even remembers that it existed, if you're still unsure about that."
Amulet,29-Jul-20,No thread of a story. Bits borrowed from The Sentinal and nothing more. Not sure what the objective was; failed miserably.
Amulet,26-Jul-20,"Extremely slow getting anywhere. Once it does get where it is going, you wish it hadn't. A boring journey. Nonsense made up ideology that goes unexplained completely. Terrible story telling (Direction and writing). Pass on this. You can't say you were not warned."
Amulet,24-Jul-20,The acting is fine but the film in general is unadulterated tosh.
Amulet,25-Jul-20,"Not so bad but borring and slow,,if you have free time and like to take nap while watching movie -why not :)"
Amulet,26-Jul-20,"I must admit that I had hoped for a bit more than what writer and director Romola Garai managed to deliver with this 2020 horror movie titled ""Amulet"". Seems that proper horror movies are starting to be a rare occurrence these days.It was the abysmal storyline that made this movie into a stinking pile of... well, you get my drift here. The storyline was just so unfathomably slow paced, and with virtually nothing of anything of noteworthy interest happening, it just felt extraordinarily prolonged. And it felt more like it was a sentence to sit down and watch ""Amulet"" than it was a movie for entertainment.I will say that the acting in the movie was adequate, especially taking into consideration that writer Romola Garai had virtually given the actors and actresses nothing to work with. Nothing. And the movie had a relatively small cast ensemble, so they had to up their game and really deliver to carry the movie. This failed to be the case, because they just didn't have the material to work with.For a horror movie, then ""Amulet"" was just dreadfully mundane and boring. There was nothing scary in the movie at all. Not even a single, cheaply and easily acquired jump scare. Yeah, so go figure...I will say that the prosthetics were good, and I did like the design of the bat. And the whole birthing thing was actually interesting enough. But these could just do nothing to salvage the train wreck that is ""Amulet"".My rating of ""Amulet"" is a generous three out of ten stars, mostly because there was a good production value to the movie. I managed to suffer through the entire course of the movie, so you don't have to. And as for the ending of the movie, well while it was just so obvious and you saw it coming a mile away, something could be said for that being a classic way of ending a horror movie.""Amulet"" really isn't worth the time, money or effort, and there are far better choices in the horror genre."
Amulet,25-Jul-20,"The best part of the movie was the spooky sound effects in the first half.
The movie spends way too much time pausing and drawing out simple concepts for dramatic effect. I kept screaming ""Get there!"" in my head.
I made it to 1h17m where I ended up bumfuzzled in the woods and couldn't take it anymore. Didn't even forward to the end to see what happened because I just didn't care."
Amulet,25-Jul-20,"The people behind this movie got many things right, an interesting story, outstanding cinematography, excellent acting from the entire cast, great atmosphere , and some sickening horror effects. Problem is, the interesting story is slow to develop, and overall much of the movie drags. Too many shots of corrosion and decay, spooky statues and slime, but not enough action. The movie needed to move along and because it didn't , it felt overly long. Secrets and demons, this could have been a cut above your usual horror movie, it's certainly well made, but in 2020 the average audience is going to ask more from a horror film then what this delivers. Worth a one time watch if you stick with it."
Amulet,27-Jul-20,"I love Hereditary and Midsommar and Lighthouse, but this is clearly not on same level. It has very bad rhythm, storytelling is way off, cast is completely uninvolving and their accents annoying. Music and sound were great, ending was somewhat rewarding, but it's done completely anticlimactically, and first hour or so were a true bore.
Even if you are horror fan, you can safely skip this, unless you are completitionist."
Amulet,27-Jul-20,"What a horrible mess of a film. It's trying far too hard to be clever and just fails, basically.
I've sat through just over an hour of this thing, up to the point he tries to kill the 'demon' and i can't watch any further. I like clever films, i like films which make you think and ponder. This thing is just a mess. Horrible film."
Amulet,23-Jul-20,"Greetings again from the darkness. Horror films tend to serve up relatively simple plot points so that viewers are controlled by emotions rather than deep thinking. The exceptions typically use multiple story lines and atmosphere to build up suspense that often ends with a twist or surprise ending. You might recognize Ramola Garai as an actress from SUFFRAGETTE (2015) or the TV series ""The Hour"", and this is her first feature film as writer-director. She definitely chose the latter plot path, and the result is likely a film that will be divisive amongst the horror crowd.Tomaz (Alec Secereanu, GOD'S OWN COUNTRY) is a former soldier with such a horrid case of PTSD that he must bind his own hands when he sleeps. He's now homeless and adrift, merely surviving day-to-day. We see flashbacks to his time as a soldier working a checkpoint deep in the forest. The war is never identified, but one day he decides to help a frantic woman (Angelika Papoulia) rather than shoot her (as we assume his orders dictate). This story and their time together pop up periodically through the movie to the point where we start to believe we have an understanding of Tomaz's background.While squatting with other homeless folks, the building where they sleep catches fire, and soon after Tomaz is taken in by Sister Claire (Imelda Staunton), a caring nun who gives him a purpose - helping out a woman who is dealing with a sick, elderly mother. Magda (Carla Juri) seems withdrawn and initially not particularly happy that Tomaz is living in her house. And, oh my, that house. Dilapidated is too kind as a description. So in addition to a bed, and Magda's cooking, Tomaz begins repairing the house. And while you may have your own renovation stories to tell, did you ever pull an albino bat out of the toilet? Tomaz has.Magda does not allow Tomaz to see her mother. He (and we) only hear the confrontations and see the bite marks on Magda's arms. Clearly something is amiss. The flashbacks to Tomaz as a soldier with Miriam make for a stark contrast between the forest and Magda's creepy house. It's in the forest where Tomaz finds the titular amulet buried. If you've always thought of an amulet as a good luck charm, your definition will likely change.It's interesting to watch the shifts in the relationship between Tomaz and Magda, culminating with a night out dancing, where she reminds us a bit of Elaine Benis at the company party ... although Magda's is a pure emotional release, rather than a comedic effect. As you might expect, the film is at its best when Imelda Staunton is on screen. Unfortunately, these moments are too rare. The ""old school"" gothic graphics for the opening credits do make for a terrific stage-setter. While Magda's locked-away mother provides some mystery, the tension of the story never really matches the creepy atmosphere of the house. Ms. Garai includes some excellent moments of horror images, but the deliberately slow pace doesn't deliver a satisfying payoff."
Amulet,31-Jul-20,"Amulet was a great sleeper for me, and not the sleeper hit type, but the fell asleep 2 nights in a row watching it. I almost fell like giving up on it, because it has a weird start, it tries to blend 2 stories together and the pacing is simply put, too slow for my tastes.As the movie progresses some stuff finally begin to happen, which trust me, was a surprise for me as well and right after that, after that exact moment it decides that it kinda skipped a beat and returns to that incredibly crawling of a movement that it did the entire time. Yet, out of nowhere it has this beautiful and engaging ending, a conclusion far too good for it's own execution, thus in my third night with Amulet instead of falling asleep again, I woke up. Yes, I was awaken by the film and finally I wanted to see more and for it not to end. Because after its runtime I wanted this to be as memorable as it could so I could call it a good investment for myself.So besides that final act alone, mostly, final 3 scenes to be exact, don't expect it to last like 30 minutes of the movie or so, beside that great conclusion Amulet is a movie that could have been great but just like all other such examples, it is not. Sadly there are far too many flaws compared to good aspects of it, so I'll give it a 5/10 because it did manage to bring some new things to the screen but the way it delivered was close to annoyingly boring.Cheers!"
Terminator: Dark Fate,03-Nov-19,"We, when we watch it, when we pay a ticket, we encourage these people to keep trowing garbarge at us, we need to stop..."
Terminator: Dark Fate,03-Nov-19,"I'll be honest, Dark Fate is more mediocre than unwatchable, probably the best Terminator since T2... yeah, I know, the bar is so low, it's like limbo dancing at this point. This feels similar to The Force Awakens: in itself a slick, decent movie, but I've already watched the much better original, so thanks but no thanks.Positives? Mackenzie Davis, for whom I've had a hopeless crush since seeing her as a cute NASA geek in The Martian (and then again in Blade Runner 2049), plays a relatable, compelling character, with an intriguing mix of power and vulnerability. There are also a couple of neat set-pieces, especially in the first half, before everything becomes over-the-top tiresome.Linda Hamilton and Arnold show up for fanservice. It's kind of nice to see them both back with significant roles but, as is typical of fanservice, it's like gorging on too much chocolate: tastes good at first, but then come nausea and a vague feeling of shame.My main point is, the Terminator series is now hopeless, as the last movies, especially Genisys, have poisoned the well. The continuity is a mess and keeps being rebooted, so everything is pointless: no development can feel meaningful. Show of hands: who would be particularly surprised if the next Terminator movie was once again about John Connor leading the Resistance in another alternate continuity? No one? Thought so.Also, the new villain being so talkative was possibly the single stupidest idea in the whole project. You know why Arnold in T1 and Robert Patrick in T2 were so terrifying? Because they shut up! They said very little and, the few times they spoke, it always felt like something they did out of pure necessity (probing for informations, setting up a trap) but was fundamentally alien to their nature.This Rev-9 tries to talk its antagonists out of fighting him! Can anyone picture the T-1000 reasoning with its targets? The great Robert Patrick studied and imitated the body language of birds of prey to look creepier and inhuman, and the new bad guy wants to chat. Give me a break.5/10"
Terminator: Dark Fate,15-Jan-20,"This really isn't a sequel to T2. The plot of this movie actually negates the first two movies, only to retell basically the same story. There are some great action sequences, by the story is basically the same as previous Terminator films. Someone from the future is sent back to the past to protect the 'only hope' in the future.We know from T2 that Skynet is stopped, so Judgment Day never happens. But none of this matters, because a new company called Legion, ends up doing the same thing in the future anyway. Basically, this movie tells us that an AI Judgment Day is inevitable. Even if they stop Legion in this movie, another company can just take its place in any future sequel."
Terminator: Dark Fate,24-Nov-19,"It's like they wrote down all the political commentaries they wanted in the movie and then just filled in the rest, just copied and pasted without any regard for plot, logic or entertaining value whatsoever. All those 10/10 reviews insulting people for not liking this incredibly bad movie are hilarious, apparently you are not allowed to dislike female lead movies no matter how atrocious the are so they call you a troll, incel, racist, misogynist... Some of them even say it's better than 1 & 2 which goes to show how credible these reviews are. Anyways this movie has no entertaining value and no substance and is definitely the worst Terminator movie yet. If you haven't seen it watch The Sarah Connor Chronicles instead and if you're looking for a good action movie with solid strong female characters, there are plenty to choose from:The Alien franchise, Underworld franchise, Resident Evil franchise, The Hunger Games franchise, Battle Angel Alita, Ghost in the Shell,Tomb Raider, Atomic Blonde, Salt, Mad Max Fury Road, Hanna, Haywire, Sucker Punch, Wonder Woman, Kill Bill 1& 2, Red Sparrow...Trust me there is a reason this movie was a total flop and lost so much money, and it's not sexism or any other silly excuse these virtue signaling fake reviewers will throw at you.The Expanse is an incredibly awesome sci-fi tv show filled with amazing and strong female characters all around, two of them (Drummer and Avasarala) being my favorite characters of the show by far, so if you looking for quality entertainment with lots and lots of cool strong female characters, this is a must for you."
Terminator: Dark Fate,24-Oct-19,"The movie starts off by killing John Connor. There, that's all you need to know. Everything Sarah Connor and Kyle Reese went through Terminator 1 was for nothing. Everything John, Sarah and Uncle Bob went through Terminator 2 was for nothing.With a retcon that would make Highlander 2 blush with envy, it turns out that Skynet had actually sent back multiple Terminators to take out John -- a move that not only goes against the entire internal logic of Terminator 2, but also carries the added weight of having irrevocably defiled the emotional weight of Uncle Bob's heartrending death scene. In case anyone forgot, the sole reason he died was because his was the last CPU that could lead to Skynet's creation and he willingly accepted his fate to prevent that from happening.But whatever, they stopped Skynet, so now a new rogue AI has taken its place -- because what else are they gonna do? -- and it sent back a Terminator to kill some random girl who's gonna become the new leader of the resistance against Skynet 2.0. Tell me if things start sounding familiar to you, because I'm having serious deja vu here.And oh yeah, the Terminator that killed John is the same one played by Arnold -- just like Terminator 3 -- only this time he's moved on, started a family and settled down and we're somehow supposed to care about the guy that essentially murdered 2 great movies' worth of development.And there's also that blonde man-robot ""thing"" that defies categorization, both gender-wise and human-wise. And the main antagonist is some Mexican guy who suffers from such a lack of presence and menace that Robert Patrick could obliterate him with a glare.And the movie basically ends with Sarah adopting what's-her-name to train her to become the future leader of the human resistance. Did I ever tell you the definition of insanity? Actually, I just did...Did I just spoil the movie for you? Yes, I did. Should you care? If you have any love for Terminator 1 and 2 and everything they stand for, then no...no, you shouldn't...because nobody involved in the making of this thing cared one bit...and it shows, in all its abhorrent wretchedness.28 years...3 horrible sequels, each one worse than the last...and now here we are, the fabled OFFICIAL continuation of Terminator 2...and we haven't budged a single goddamn inch since 1991. Yup...The future is not set because it's destined to repeat itself.
There is no fate but what we make for ourselves...until the next hack writer comes along and decides to ex machina everything back to square 1."
Terminator: Dark Fate,04-Nov-19,"What the actual &$*. Did the creators of this movie think that we forgot everything that occurred before? Did they think we got neuralized MIB style? You know some of us are old enough to remember the Terminator timeline, the Terminator chain of events.They completely crapped on the Terminator franchise. It's like the writers didn't even know there existed a Terminator movie before this one.Let's review shall we?1984: A Terminator goes back to kill Sarah Connor. She's protected by Kyle Reese and Sarah can now give birth to the leader of the resistance, John Connor.1991: Judgment Day. John Connor is 13-years-old (I know it doesn't make sense but roll with it) and a T-1000 is sent back to kill John Connor. He's protected by an Arnie T-800 model which is destroyed at the end. Which means that Cyberdyne no longer has the tech available to bring about Judgment Day which is supposed to occur August 29th, 1997.2003: Rise of the Machines. Sarah Connor is dead. John Connor is about 25-years-old. Judgment Day never happened on August 29, 1997. John has been off the grid so long that a T-X is sent back to kill Connor's lieutenants. While searching for Kate Brewster (Claire Danes), the T-X lucks upon John Connor as well. Again, an Arnie T-800 is there to protect them. They don't stop Skynet, machines launch an offensive, and both Terminators are destroyed.2009: Salvation. This was post-apocalyptic and John Connor was in the thick of leading the resistance.2015: Genisys. They rewrote everything with a brand new Sarah Connor. A travesty of a movie.Which brings us to today. I was thinking that this Terminator was to right the wrongs committed in 2015. It was not. It was here to further s$&t on an already broken franchise. For me to elaborate I must play spoiler. So, here's your warning.*****************SPOILER ALERT*********************
The movie starts with two new creations being sent back to Mexico City 2019: an enhanced human and a greatly enhanced Terminator. Their target is Danielle ""Dani"" Ramos. Why? We don't immediately know but clearly she is a big thorn in the side of robots.Question #1. Where are the robots here in 2019? Per T3, Skynet launched and Armageddon was in full effect. Never mind let's move on.Eventually, a sixty-something-year-old cranky Sarah Connor enters the picture. We later find out from her that a third Arnie T-800 killed her son John in 1998.Question #2. How was John Connor killed in 1998 when he was alive in 2003 and later?Question #3. How was Sarah Connor still alive when she died of leukemia per T3?I'm finding out now that this movie is supposed to be a continuation of the timeline after T2. Which means that the three movies after T2 were a big red herring and a colossal waste of time. Was it all a dream? Even if they weren't great (I actually liked T3) they were still cohesive continuations of the timeline (with the exception of Genisys).For the sake of argument and proceeding with the movie at hand let's move on.We find out that an Arnold Schwarzenegger Cyberdyne 101 (T-800) terminator is still alive. He has a family and purpose.WTF.This is so absurd that I don't even know where to start with the questions.This Terminator--a machine--decided to adopt a family after killing John Connor. Like, ""Well, I have no one to kill so let me settle down and start a family."" Plus, he was so remorseful for that killing that he forever after helped Sarah Connor eliminate other Terminators by feeding her information. What rubbish.First of all, I can't imagine a Terminator, whose sole mission is to eliminate human existence, would decide to live a normal human life after executing its primary target. Even if it didn't continue to kill mercilessly I would think that it'd be programmed to self-destruct so that it's technology wouldn't fall into the wrong hands. Imagine if their enemy, meaning humans, got a hold of it and could figure out a more effective way of stopping them because they dissected a captured bot. Whatever a successful Terminator does I doubt that it's programmed to live out the rest of its days installing carpets.Even IF this T-800 wanted to retire to the countryside with a wife and kids, how in the name of all that is good would he be able to do this without being discovered as a machine? Yes, they somewhat addressed this in the movie but they only scratched the surface of the giveaways. The machine indicators are too numerous to mention. It's laughable that they would even enter that into the storyline.Furthermore, it was just cheap to have Sarah Connor hate the Arnie Terminator again. One of the most iconic scenes in cinematic history is the one when Sarah Connor is attempting to escape the hospital. She turns the corner and there's an Arnie Terminator, clad in black with a shotgun on his shoulder. The fear in her eyes was palpable. Then she grew to love him to some degree as he protected her and her son. All that just to have her hate him again! RidiculousNow we have Dani Ramos as the primary target and John Connor is totally out of the picture. We find out that Dani's main gifts are the ability to make people stop fighting each other. That's great and all but come on.John Connor was forged for the job as a leader of the resistance. His mother bore him and trained him since birth how to prepare for Judgment Day and how to fight Terminators. It made perfect sense for him to lead the resistance. His preparation was decades in the making. Now we get a woman whose greatest asset is being a motivational speaker.I felt this movie was done more as a women empowerment movie rather than to make a good movie consistent with Terminator events. Which to me is counterproductive. By rolling out this trash it does more to hurt women empowerment than help. I don't want to associate women empowerment with trash remakes of classic movies. But I'm afraid Hollywood is effectively doing that."
Terminator: Dark Fate,26-Oct-19,"The terminator gets a similar politically correct treatment as the star wars Disney sequels with racial diversity and feminism. You can tell Arnold and Linda did it for the money without bringing much passion to the screen and the new actors/characters are flat and weak.
There's not much action till the last 30 min and even then its heavily cgi'd/cartoonish and you don't care about any of the characters.Now all we need is to invent a time machine and send someone to 1997 and stop James Cameron from making titanic so he could direct the proper conclusion to the terminator trilogy with a young Arnold and save us from all these dreadful sequels from the last 20 years."
Terminator: Dark Fate,17-Jan-20,"I literally wanted to turn it off after 15 minutes it was that bad. Everything from the script, the acting, the casting, it was just all bad. More ""wokeness"" from the SJWs that have taken over Hollywood.Besides being a total rip-off Judgment Day the special effects are worse now.I think the next Terminator needs to be gay black T-5000 against an Asian Trans woman T-7800 and it should take place in Haiti for the inclusivity.Movies are just getting worse and worse, but audiences seem happy with the inferior films coming out. The newer generations just haven't seen enough quality films to know a dud. Imagine all you had to eat your whole life was rotten fruit, then you likely will love rotten fruit. But once you had a juicy fresh fruit any rotten fruit will be repugnant to your system.Most Hollywood films today are treated like comic books. Very clinical, but in the process they lost the organic human touch and realism.SKIP IT!"
Terminator: Dark Fate,26-Oct-19,"It's almost as if Tim Miller watched T3, Salvation and Genisys, found every aspect fans hated and crammed them into one film. Just like salvation it moves the focus from John Connor. The hybrid man/machine returns. The aged Arnold returns, with the exact same excuse we had in Genisys.There's nothing original in this and the writing is woeful. The believability of T1 and T2 is long gone. Over exaggerated fight scenes. Mind numbingly boring, over convoluted cgi. And characters with no depth, warmth or connection to the audience.This is a cash grab. No other words for it.Fans want a well written story. Practical effects. Terminator should be dark, moody, intense. The T600s used to be slow, but unstoppable. This is just more cgi throwing each other through walls.The first 5 mins gave me hope. The de-aging, was spectacularly well done. It felt like watching 1991 Linda Hamilton. That, unfortunately, was the only decent thing about the film.Utter claptrap.Hasta la vista Terminator. I won't be back."
Terminator: Dark Fate,24-Oct-19,"I'm a huge Terminator fan, I re-watched both 1 & 2 before seeing this. Big mistake.I'm gutted to say that this film has none of what makes Terminator 2 one of the best films of all time. The writing is below par, plot uninteresting and emotional connection between the Terminator and John Connor, none of that either. James Cameron, what is this? Mind, I don't think he's been on form for a good few years now.What makes Terminator 2 an amazing film aside from the brilliant plot, amazing effects, great screen writing and superb acting is the emotional connection between the Terminator and John Connor. This is the life blood of that film and makes the viewer really believe that despite the hopeless future humanity is facing, if this Terminator can protect John then maybe mankind has a chance. The Terminator is a father figure to John and this is what connects the audience with the film so much. The heart wrenching ending cannot be forgotten. The fact that we forget the the Terminator isn't human because of how well the film builds the bond. This is what makes Terminator 2 so great, not the epic action sequences.So I'm sad to say this film has absolutely none of that. CGI, CGI and more CGI. Do away with the depth of character building, emotional connections and just add over the top action. It's a poor follow up and lacks everything of what made 1 & 2 great. The acting is decent, Davis, Hamilton and Schwarzenegger do a good job but they've got very little to work with here. This is what disappointed me the most. Why does it lack substance? This is James Cameron's epic creation and this is what he serves up along with Tim Miller? A total cash in if I've ever seen one. If not going to divulge into the plot anymore, there's no need as it can't even be mentioned in the same breath as the first two films.If this film was viewed as a generic action film at the cinema it'd still be mediocre. The fact that this is supposed to follow on from the brilliant Terminator 2 just makes it even more disappointing. This is James Cameron's judgment day.Do yourselves a favour and wait until it hits home release or if you are planning on seeing it, don't bother watching the first two beforehand, you'll be even more disappointed."
Terminator: Dark Fate,27-Oct-19,"Terminator: Dark Fate is the next tired attempt to revive the Terminator Franchise.In a nutshell, this is awful. The film is little more than a generic and tepid action film with the Terminator name slapped on it. For 200 million dollars, it looks incredibly cheap and very bland, with an overly lit brown/beige palette and locations that you've all seen before (more road chases, more factories).Mackenzie Davis is the standout and gives a really good performance as Grace, but the others are really below par. Even Linda Hamilton portrays Sarah Conner as some inept old women who is just really annoying. Her angst and negativity in T2 was always justified, but here the motivation are all so thin that it ends up just being a pale facsimile of what she did for Cameron. Arnie is 100% phoning it in here and his role in the film is almost comical in regard to his ""character's"" situation. The new girl....isn't even worth mentioning.The plot is just exactly the same old ""send a bad guy and a good guy back to kill/protect someone then go on a chase"". There's absolutely nothing new here at all, and almost every beat from the other films is re-hashed, only here they inject long boring sections where nothing happens. These parts are supposed to be ""dramatic"", but there's no depth or originality to the story or characters for those kind of moments to work without just being dull.The CGI is woeful too, and I'll not spoil anything, but it takes a very big dump on the first two films from the very start.Any attempt at a third Terminator film should have been made in 1996-98. The film should have been written and directed by James Cameron and should have been completely set in the blue tinted post-apocalyptic setting we saw glimpses of in the first two films.Alas, we will never see James Cameron's ""Terminator 3: Future War"" as not only has the lore been tainted, but the time for it has well and truly passed.Terminator: Dark Fate is not only a poor, poor attempt at a third ""canon"" entry in the franchise, but it is for me, the worst of the post-T2 movies.Yes, even Genisys."
Terminator: Dark Fate,25-Oct-19,"Another horrible sequel. It had no heart, no atmosphere, underwritten characters and no John Connor.
Hollywood... stop giving us this crap. If you can not make it awesome, then leave it alone.There are only T1 and T2 ... the rest is crappy fan fiction.
And why Arnold or Linda agreed to this, I don´t know. It´s just another slap in the face of the fans. They completely destroyed the franchise and lost trust.
There is no going back from this."
Terminator: Dark Fate,25-Oct-19,"Here we go again...The film is a complete, lazy, uninspired cash-grab. They are so disgustingly, shamelessly DEVOID of ideas. I simply dont understand how this is even possible with all the amazing comics, fan fiction tales and James Cameron's own future war concepts being right there for the picking.Say what you will of Linda's performance being great, of Grace's performance being cool. I don't remotely care because this film has no business even existing.
It not only offers nothing new at all and has the stones to tell the same bloody story again, but it goes further than that by outright trying to fool you into believing its original groundbreaking.How does it do this? By shamelessly exploiting the current cultural phenomena of pushing female super heroes everywhere. Problem is fantastic movies like Wonder Woman that accomplish this well, or Alita: Battle Angel doing even better, this film however just tries to ride that wave with minimal freaking effort and it is making my blood boil.John Connor is dead. He gets shot in the first 4 minutes of the film.
Okay, thats different. Fine. I can deal with that. But now what? Are you gonna come up with some super cool, different concept ?Of course they aren't. They just replace him with a girl. And nothing at all changes.
Like literally, nothing changes. Its so pathetically uninspired and I see people and media praising it for being like The Force Awakens.Like what the actual F ? How is that a good thing? Ripping off completely and pretending its fine. Its just so typical of entertainment these days. Hollywood is so monumentally bankcrupt of ideas.Why not do something actually different?We could've done something really cool with the future war here. We could've gone further, and now that Linda Hamilton is back they could've made her the leader. Driven by her loss of her son.Thats a freaking awesome story right there and Linda is still rocking it.
But no... instead of doing something cool to respect the original, they throw it all out the window and gender swap John Connor with a chick from Mexico.And we've established that there is absolutely nothing special about her at all.
Now this is once again where the The Force Awakens problem by making your movie political and pushing the agenda that everyone who's not special can accomplish great things.The only problem with this is that its been done before. And better.
I am so sick of this. The director made statements on social media that this movie would scare people who had issues with women. Indirectly insinuating anyone who has a problem with the movie has a problem with women .
The film also tries to pander to the current political climate with border talk between the US and Mexico which everyone is sick and tired of but who cares.I'm simply at a loss for words when I try to figure out what is worse.
Heavy political and agenda pushing influence in this movie, by gender swapping a beloved lead character for decades to pander, or by simply using this tactic as a mean of exploitation... to make a really lazy, easy movie and get people to watch it, thinking its some masterpiece... when in truth its just a lazy, pointless remake.I'll leave that up to you, dear reader, to decide.My top 6 Pros and Cons.Nr 1: Linda was great. Really awesome, believable, strong and epic as always.Nr 2: Arnold was cringe as Karl the Terminator. So weird, and the little hints at how men should behave made me roll my eyes. Having a non-physical relationship. Yeah right... in what universe, pal.Nr 3: Mckenzie Davis was really cool. I expected to hate her character but i didn't. I wish she had survived at the end. But nothing good is allowed to exist in this franchise.Nr 4::Dani was utterly filler. Her entire character is pure filler, pure pandering. This is not how to pass the torch. Wasted character.Nr 5: The villain isn't scary. They said Rev 9 is the most dangerous terminator. Well, I dont buy it. He's being bullied, bossed around, thrown everywhere, easily kept at bay with guns and overall the nice, calm, human persona of the infiltration behavioral pattern just makes the character look like a really generic villain. Calm, evil, almost psychopathic, but that is not what a Terminator is. And hilariously Arnie's Young Cameo at the start of the movie posed MORE of a threat than the entirety of the Rev 9 throughout the entire movie.
It is nothing short of insane how badly they understand what a Terminator is supposed to act like.Nr 6: And this is possibly the worst part of the film in its totality. The movie has no replay value at all. It is very slow moving, quite boring, it takes so long and wasted so much time running around in Mexico, riding trains to the border, getting caught by border guards, passing out in drugstores etc etc.Its so god damn boring and the action scenes are few and far between if you can believe it and they aren't very good either.Final thoughts4 out of 10. Lame, uninspired, wasteful, lazy, generic, and perhaps more than anything - desperate - to win whatever audience attendence they can get by pandering and including political elements which will only conclude in the worst crime a movie can commit. Something James Cameron himself talked about in his interviews with great filmmakers alike himself.That of creating something timeless that can be enjoyed regardless of how old it gets.And Dark Fate is anything but that...
I'm glad Arnie wont be back. I sure as hell won't either."
Terminator: Dark Fate,26-Oct-19,"What the heck was that, destroys T1 & T2 in the first 5 mins, remaining movie is parading current political correctness.
Just stop, please just stop........"
Terminator: Dark Fate,25-Oct-19,"It's not. Atleast not the one I ever wanted.It's barely any better than the other failed sequels that have come since 1991. I might actually prefer some of the others, as much as I disliked them at the time.Looking at it objectively, it's not an awful movie. But they built it up so much with the return of Cameron and saying it was a 'return to form' etc that I think the disappointment has hit twofold. It is a very, very average film.I'm conscious of some 'gender politics' attached to this movie, or how it's perceived. Please understand that I was fully okay with having three female leads. Terminator has been the tale of 'the mother of the future' all along after all. Let's be clear that it was just a fairly poor film, regardless of gender.There are still only two films as far as I'm concerned - T1 & T2. If you want the real follow up, get hold of copies of the comics 'T2: Cybernetic Dawn' and 'T2: Nuclear Twilight.' (Read them in that order). They wrapped up the story tidily and respectfully. This film achieved neither of those things."
Terminator: Dark Fate,20-Nov-19,"The evil Terminators still want to take over the world!!... but they're gonna learn not to mess with angry feminists!!Our old beloved characters are gone! Dead!!
Move over John Conner (you useless male) we now have a new saviour, and she's gonna save Woman kind!Natalia Reyes is humanities New, ""last"" saviour!
She's a combination of Kyle Reese, Sarah & John Connor all rolled into one!
Mackenzie Davis is the sexy, kick ass, super soldier from the future and Linda Hamilton is back as a battle hardened, crusty old bad-ass with a score to settle!
Oh. Arnie makes a weak and embarrassing comeback as a reformed and neutered male, whose willing to make the ultimate sacrifice for the feminist cause!
No clichés here at all!!Together they join forces to destroy the evil and (male) misogynist terminator!Using only their wits, and a whole lot of estrogen, they will save humanity from this evil, patriarchal scourge!Go girls!"
Terminator: Dark Fate,22-Feb-20,"But overall it is lame despite the (re)appearance of Hamilton and Schwarzenneger.
The issue is that the plot lines are unexplained.
'How did you do that?'
'Oh it is some future crap'
!!!Really?
And the two adult women have sort hair like boys. What am I supposed to do with that??"
Terminator: Dark Fate,16-Jan-20,"There's nothing original about this apart from killing off John Conner, which gives massive relevance to the flaws in the rest of the film, but, before that, like t2s major flaw in the t1000, lets draw attention to the fact that they very clearly state in the original film that nothing none organic can pass through the time displacement unit, ie, if it doesn't have real skin on it it won't travel back. They broke that rule in t2 straight away and again in this 1 which is unforgivable considering the importance. It's why they come through naked etc. Anyway, the John Conner death effectively changes the timeline completely. It's no longer skynet that became 'aware' but 'legion'. Not important you may say, but if the t800 (arnie) terminator has been sending Sarah Conner details of where all the other terminators sent back by SKYNET appear (also, for what reason ,given that John is dead now. Who would they hunt?) how could he possibly know where the new terminator sent back by a totally different computer with different tech from an alternate timeline would turn up to make sure Sarah Conner turns up to help grace etc? It simply makes no sense. They assume you won't think about the huge plotholes."
Terminator: Dark Fate,16-Jan-20,"I say remake because nothing in this movie is new. It is merely recycling past editions. So it is boring and pointless. Most of the movie is following women crossing Mexican border and has nothing to do with sci-fi. Thanks god they did not precipitate the movie into politics. Nevertheless, The all-female cast does not bring any added value, on the contrary. I should finish this review by saying how stupid it is to buy such expensive rights and then have no imagination how to make something new out of it. Fans would write a better script for sure."
Terminator: Dark Fate,24-Jan-20,"I'm having a tough time understanding why they chose to basically rewrite the entire Terminator storyline instead making a new/separate series. I never paid much attention to people whining about too many female leads, because there have been a lot of fantastic series with female leads, my favorite being Resident Evil. However.. for maybe the first time I have to agree.
Another bad idea thing that seems to be in fashion is bring back actors from previous movies in the series, which is especially bad for this flick. You ruined Sarah Conners, and why oh why did Arnold ever agree to be apart of this?
Sigh.. Unfortunately I have to agree with all these bad reviews. The Terminator series has been deeply tarnished with this attempt of rewriting one of my childhood favorites."
Terminator: Dark Fate,26-Oct-19,"FFS, please stop making Terminator movies already. The first 2 are masterpieces and the movies should have stopped there. Everything after T2 was crap."
Terminator: Dark Fate,25-Oct-19,"Realisation:
It's rubbish, we never understand anything about where the character are in some action scene. No mood, we can't feel any danger or tension.Music:
It's a Joke in comparison of T2. Brad fiedel was a genius here it's just ok for a budget movie.Scenario: If you are a fan of the Franchise stay away from this. It's so stupid. Basically the same plot points of T2 but without the philosophical issues and emotional charge. James Cameron turned his back from his fans. If you are attached to the lore of the Franchise, forget everything. The t800 is a joke, really, like a real one.
I went there with an open mind but i have the bitter impression that i have seen a political movie. I'am not opposed to that if the movie is good ( i loved Joker and i strongly disagree with its political message). i mean T2 was about a really strong women in the first place, we all love Sarah Connor. But here it's just dumb and this, ultimately does not serve the political message because of the plot inconsistency.Acting:
Linda Hamilton is okay and it's the only thing that save the movie with makenzie ( even if her character is not well written)
Arnold just came to take his paycheck, his performance is hilarious.
Natalia Reyes is transparent.
The rev9, gabriel Luna have no charisma, he scares no one, he is ridiculous.
But i'am all going to forgive them, given the emptyness of the scenario and staging. It's really not their fault.this movie is an absolute middle finger to the fans.
T2 was a masterpiece, this, is unforgivable. This can't be the following of the franchise, because of the inconsistency and basic common sense. Two major charachter have nothing to do with the story now, since after a major plot point in dark fate, Terminator 1 becomes a story about a waitress who got stood up by her boyfriend and go out eat a pizza. Basically a bridget Jones movie.I was complaining with Salvation but it was a far better movie. I was hyped because of James Cameron, i feel betrayed.As far as i 'am concerned, this movie never existed."
Terminator: Dark Fate,27-Oct-19,"Notice how most of the positive reviews say that ""it's the best sequel since T2""? 🤔First, for actual T2 fans, THAT MEANS NOTHING.Second, it's a strange coincidence. If I were on the marketing team though, that's exactly what I'd say to get butts in the seats.This was just more anti-male propaganda. The new terminator is androgynous, and the rest of the movie is about ""girl power"" and how useless men are even though they make all the female leads manifestly masculine.The director said that ""it would scare closet misogynists."" I've never actually met a misogynist, but if I do, I'll tell him he's owed a scapegoat fee."
Terminator: Dark Fate,04-Nov-19,"They kill John. He was the reason that the first two movies worked. The movie was woke trash. Let's replace beloved characters with female counterparts just ""because"". So its not about a male savior but we are going to keep the line ""for John""...even though we killed him. Also Dani ""doesn't need no man to save her"" to which Sarah replies ""you're john."" So now johns important again..even though we just killed him. The t-800 developed remorse after killing John. What? Terminators aren't supposed to feel anything. Terminator 2 was the perfect ending."
Terminator: Dark Fate,07-Feb-20,"Good: Linda Hamilton and Schwarzenneger show up. There is quite a bit of action and there is a contemporary theme to it.Bad: the story is trivial and why are we always having women be short haired and unattractive? The deleted scenes have a cute nurse, but otherwise/////"
Gladiator,06-Aug-14,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.What we do in life echoes in eternity.So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.I didn't know man could build such things.Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men's destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10"
Gladiator,24-Feb-20,"Gladiator is a historical epic from director Ridley Scott. After being betrayed by the new Caesar, Roman general Maximus is sold into slavery as a gladiator where he rises to fame as a people's champion and finds an opportunity to exact his revenge. Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, and Connie Nielsen lead the cast and deliver strong performances. Additionally, the gladiator fights are especially dynamic and exciting, featuring several different styles of combat. The costumes and sets are also remarkably well-done, and create a vivid depiction of ancient Rome. And, Hans Zimmer's score does an excellent job at capturing the tone of the film. Thrilling and action-packed, Gladiator delivers a compelling tale. ""Are you not entertained?!"""
Gladiator,06-Jun-00,"Once again, Director Ridley Scott proves to be as professional as one can be. The recreation of ancient Rome is splendid, with all its magnificent buildings and atmosphere and he is able to show with all brightness the greatness of the Roman Empire, with its political problems and military discipline, and love and treason, of hate and jealousy, that still have a place in our world today. But the story has a glow of its own, to which all the beautiful scenery (believe me, it's awesome!!!) and great cinematography are just balancing factors. The plot is a rich one, that is as dynamic as it is present. He once again, after Blade Runner, 1492, and others helps us visit the depths of the human soul, which remains the same over all our historical and social experience. Even the fights, are displayed in such a way that all the blood is quite discrete, but still, making us feel like screaming and jumping out of our seats. I would also like to point out the performances of the cast, that is surprisingly good. We have some actors and actresses, who are not Hollywood icons, but are are greatly able to move the audience among screams and tears. All in all, we have guys like Russel Crowe, who are coming out to be part of a new and extremely promising harvest of people who are making each time more fans around the world. Well, you should see for yourself!"
Gladiator,03-May-00,"Most films require that the viewer identifies with the character to truly be engrossed with the film. If you can't feel something for the character, than the audience is lost.Luckily, in Ridley Scott's case, Russel Crowe is so captivating and convincing as a general loved by his troops and as a slave loved by the people that the movie really works. Possibly one of the greatest actors today, Crowe carries this epic film on his very capable shoulders.Not to say that he is the only reason this works. The supporting cast, most notably Connie Neilsen, buoy the film to new perspectives.Jacquin Phoenix definitely captures the egotisitcal persona he should display, stealing every scene he's in. Phoenix will surely be put on the map with Gladiator.But the real shining star in this film are the incredible action sequences which jolt the viewer right in with the opening sequences, as Maximus' true worth to the Roman Empire is displayed. Scott's camera work within these completed sequences takes a modern twist that really works for the gruesome scenes.Crowe will now get the respect he deserves for this collosal performance. Gladiator makes the most of its 2 and a half hours, marking a triumphant comeback for the long forgotten epics of the classic days of film. ALL HAIL MAXIMUS!"
Gladiator,19-Feb-01,"Great Story!  Great Writing!  Great Acting!  Great Directing!  Great Score! This movie has it all.  I especially enjoyed the mood of the film.  Even though it has a lot of action, there is a subtle elegance throughout the picture that gives it great style.  The movie flows effortlessly from scene to scene, while at the same time creating wonderful intensity and nail-biting excitement.The acting in the movie more than lives up to expectations.  Russell Crowe is brilliant in his role as Maximus, the ""general who became a slave, who became a gladiator, who defied an emperor.""  Crowe's intense style is perfect for the relentless determination and confidence of Maximus.  Joaquin Phoenix is equally wonderful in his role as Commodus, the corrupt emperor. He plays a great villain because he is able to give Commodus depth by showing certain vulnerable or fragile sides, while at the same time instantly transforming to let the ruthless nature of his volatile character shine.  It also helps that Joaquin has the classic Caesar look that works perfectly with his role.Connie Nielsen is also very good as Lucilla.  However, perhaps the two finest performances in the movie were given by a couple of acting veterans in supporting roles.  Richard Harris and Oliver Reed were exceptional in what will be remembered as crowning achievements at the end of their careers.  Harris was perfect as Marcus Aurelius, the aging Caesar who reflects upon his life and contemplates how the world will remember him. And Reed, especially, gave my personal favorite performance in the movie as Proximo, the trainer for the gladiators.  The way he spoke about the life of a gladiator, the splendor of Rome, and the ""thrill of the Coliseum"" really added excitement and anticipation during the viewing of the movie.Gladiator is filled with many memorable moments that one would need to see more than once to fully appreciate.  The excitement felt for me when Rome is first shown in all its wonder and marvel is my favorite scene.  But the whole movie is a rush!  Hans Zimmer provides the absolute perfect score to capture the different moods in the movie.  Ridley Scott sets the perfect tone with his artistic and creative directing.  I would recommend it to anyone who can stomach intensity and enjoy an epic story for the ages.  Next to Braveheart, this movie is the greatest of all-time!"
Gladiator,12-Sep-05,"""Gladiator"" definitely is a classic film as it combines a simple, but moving, story with beautiful scenery, filming, direction and score  it is truly a ""complete"" movie.I am mostly compelled with the beautiful script which in a way reminds me of poetry, though it is still everyday language. I love the acting portrayed by the late Oliver Reed and also Richard Harris. Russell Crowe, Djimon Housou and Joaquin Phoenix are also superb and the parts suit them perfectly. There are also a number of less ""popular"" artists who also deserve a big ""bravo"". Amongst them I have to mention ex-Mr Universe Ralph Moeller who is mostly used as the comic relief of the movie. In Gladiator we can also the beautiful and popular Maltese TV Star and actress Ruth Frendo, who although has a small part, she is totally brilliant and outstanding.Actually I got to IMDb while I was looking for her name on the internet, in fact on IMDb she has some very stunning photos. I was lucky to meet Ruth Frendo whilst she was filming in another Maltese production. Ruth Frendo is not only a gorgeous and talented actress but she is also amazingly intelligent and very down-to-earth. We will definitely be seeing more of her work in the future... The scenery used for ""Gladiator"" is brilliant  and the opening battle scene is definitely one of my top favorite scenes. The modern camera technique contrasts sharply to the brutality of the gladiators actions and blood shed during the movie; and I love the light contrasts thanks to the lenses which most definitely have been used to create a surreal feel to the entire movie.""Gladiator"" deserves all the awards and great reviews it has received, and for those of you who still haven't gone and watched it  I can assure you that it will be well worth your time and money. So go on and rent it now!"
Gladiator,18-Feb-19,Seriously the best fantasy film of the modern area with great acting and emotional rollercoastering all the way through. The soundtrack by Zimmer really propels this film
Gladiator,09-Jul-17,"Gladiator, 2000's Best Picture winner, was undoubtedly one of the biggest successes of the decade. It made tons of box-office cash, nearly swept the Oscars, and revitalized the sword-and-sandals genre for years to come. Does the movie warrant the massive success it received? For the most part, yes. Ridley Scott's Roman blockbuster doesn't have quite the overwhelming emotion of another Oscar-winning epic, Braveheart, but as a brawny action spectacle, Gladiator soars. With a strong story, a profound sense of character, and action and special effects that are suitably exciting, Gladiator is a special kind of sword-and-sandals picture; One with a true dramatic core.Like the great epics of Hollywood's past, Gladiator is simple in its story. Russell Crowe stars as the Roman General, Maximus, whose life is thrown into chaos after the jealous Emperor Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) arranges for his execution. Maximus is sold into slavery where he meets Proximo, a former gladiator played by Oliver Reed who shepherds him through life as a gladiator as Commodus scrambles to stop Maximus' influence among the people. The story of Gladiator is a rock-solid tale of revenge, bolstered by well written characters, some sly political subtext, and a couple of stellar performances from Crowe and Phoenix. The two principle characters, Maximus and Commodus, are what separates Gladiator from the slew of sword-and-sandals epics that came after it. They are simply but elegantly written as characters; Maximus, a man singularly driven by a need to return to his family, Commodus, a confused young man singularly driven by a need to be loved. However, it is the performances from Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix that really elevate this material. Phoenix gives a brilliant portrait of an emotionally frustrated young man. He is completely unpredictable, but he never becomes campy. He is a real person with real problems, and there is an underlying sadness to his character that makes him so much more interesting than your typical stock villain. As for Crowe, his performance is all about physical presence. Apart from a few big emotional scenes, Crowe's performance is one of quiet masculine stoicism. He adds a remarkable gravitas to this character that all but makes the movie. You feel for him, you relate to him, you root for him, and you become inspired by him. It is a perfect heroic performance. The character stuff in Gladiator really works. Coming from a genre that made do with archetypal characters doing obligatory British accents for years, it is nothing short of a revelation that Gladiator is such a fulfilling dramatic experience. Here are characters you actually care about and not simply placeholders to string up the plot in between action scenes.When it comes to general filmmaking, Gladiator is rarely pedestrian and often astounding. Apart from some strange quirks in the filmmaking like the seemingly digitized zooms or the moments when the frame rate seems to cause a weird flicker effect, Gladiator is a deep, rich, and meticulously detailed visual experience. Hollywood production values don't get much higher than this. The technical departments are tops in terms of production design and costuming. The movie looks expensive, but there is something else in Gladiator's visual style that keeps your eyes glued to the screen. The look of the film, with its mix of traditional, large- scale sets and CG enhancements, is almost dreamlike. The environments of Ridley Scott's version of ancient Rome, including a painstakingly crafted digital recreation of the famous Colosseum, seem untethered to any kind of physical reality. It's as if what Scott has created is an environment that reflects the feeling of Ancient Rome rather than the reality of it. Just as with the deep characters and eloquent script, there's a modern feeling to Ridley Scott's filmmaking in Gladiator. The reliance on CGI is sometimes overdone, but in conjunction with the costumes, sets, and impressively grandiose score from Hans Zimmer, it adds to the intoxicating atmosphere of Ridley Scott's world.The main attraction of Gladiator is its scenes of gladiatorial combat, and on that front, Ridley Scott aptly gets the job done. There are a few moments when Scott falls back on to standard sword clashing and disorientating shaky cam, but for the most part, the action scenes are exciting, bloody, and imaginatively staged. The best action scenes are the opening Barbarian battle and a fantastic fight scene between Maximus, a veteran gladiator, and a Colosseum full of bloodthirsty tigers. In those scenes, Scott's emphasis on close-up, sweaty, brutal action is totally effective. I felt the cold of the forest mud, the heat of the flaming trees, the sharpness of the swords, and the dusty claustrophobia of the Arena. The action of Gladiator is visceral and bloody, and there is plenty of it. Those hungry for bloodsport will find more than enough manly derring-do to satiate their red-blooded desire.For all its dramatic depth, I can't say I came out of Gladiator heavily affected by feeling. This is still, at its core, a visceral experience, but the small character moments and the textured performances are miraculously riveting. I was intrigued by every second of Gladiator. The action scenes are thrilling, the dramatic scenes are mesmerizing, and the $103 million budget is all up there on the screen in every frame. Ridley Scott's direction is superlative, especially in the third act, as the story, action, and emotions reach a fever pitch. The last few scenes, including the climactic final showdown and the closing 'Elysium' scene, exhibit a crescendo of the kind of daring artistry that permeates the film's best sections. Gladiator is a meaty Hollywood epic of the best kind. It's visually sumptuous and supremely thrilling, but there is a beating heart within this beast. Sure there are a couple of bumps along the way, but with Crowe as the sturdy hero and a simple story of returning home, Gladiator stays with you long after the credits roll.92/100"
Gladiator,04-Jun-00,"The movie is the story of Maximus (Crowe), a general who leads the Roman army to victory over Germania in the beginning of the movie. The dying emperor of Rome, Marcus Aurelius, is watching this battle.The emperor's son, Commodus, then arrives with his sister Lucilla, and it is discovered that Commodus fully expects to be announced the new emperor of Rome in a few days. Aurelius, however, has other plans--he wants to make Maximus emperor, and requests that of the general, who wants nothing more than to go home to his family.I went into this movie having just watched Ben-Hur in my film studies class and having watched an episode of Xena only a couple of weeks earlier that featured the story of Marc Anthony and Cleopatra. So you could say I was in the perfect mindset to watch a ""sword-and-sandal"" movie. I wasn't sure what to expect, having somehow avoided all the hype that accompanied this movie. But I was not disappointed.Gladiator features some wonderful cinematography by John Mathieson. The battle scenes are very graphic. (This movie is not for the squeamish, that's for sure.) There were some scenes in particular that really struck me, such as when Crowe appears to be floating over the ground very fast.  The use of color and color tones added a great deal to the mood of the movie. Excellent.The script was being written and re-written as the filming was going on, yet it doesn't show that the actors had no idea how the movie was going to end when they began filming.  The acting is terrific. Russell Crowe is wonderfully cast as Maximus. Many reviewers agree that he is now officially a star. Joaquin Phoenix also proves his mettle as the emotionally troubled Commodus, whose behavior and emotion toward his sister could give anyone the creeps. Connie Nielsen makes you believe that, as Lucilla, she really is torn between natural loyalty to her brother and doing what she knows is right. Oliver Reed, in his last performance, is memorable in his role of Proximo, the former gladiator who is the owner of Maximus and brings him to Rome.  In short, the actors were brilliant in their roles, not over-acting, but giving subtle, strong performances.The script itself is very good.  Although some elements are a little hard to believe--the fact that no one recognizes Maximus when he's a slave?--this film calls for a willing suspension of disbelief, which one would happily comply with.  (It's really no fun to nitpick such a movie.)It's true that this movie does pretty much follow the Braveheart formula. However, this movie includes some elements, such as the cinematography and the incredibly graphic battle scenes (one reviewer likened it to Saving Private Ryan, ""only better""), that are spectacular in itself. Overall, a great movie that I highly recommend."
Gladiator,02-May-00,"The epic blockbuster returns with the 21st Century's answer to Cecil B DeMille, Ridley Scott and his dramatic tale of courage and revenge, GLADIATOR - ""the general who became a slave, the slave who became a gladiator, the gladiator who defied an emperor"".Once a great roman General, and as good as adopted son of Marcus Aurelius Caesar (Harris), Maximus (Crowe) is forced into exile by Commodus (Phoenix), heir to the throne, after the death of Marcus. Saved from death by slavers, he is purchased for use as a gladiator by Proximo (Reed) and ends up in the arena of all arena's, the Colloseum, where he proves unbeatable under his guise as ""The Spaniard"".And with a budget of over $100m, Scott certainly delivers the goods. GLADIATOR transcends the notion of 'blockbuster' that we have become accustomed to in the age of electronic and special effects wizardry and instead offers a good old fashioned action film along the lines of Spartacus and and Ben Hur. Not only are we drawn into an archetypal story that contains all the classic elements a filmgoer could dream of (love, loss, courage, despair, good triumphing over evil etc etc) - also on offer is a visual feast of cinematic painting after painting - a rich tapestry of images that are breathtaking and ultimately visually satisfying. From the plains of Germania, to the desert stronghold of Zuchobar, and finally to great Rome herself, John Mathiesion, the cinematographer is to be commended highly for his general inventiveness and ability to capture so much on film. The opening  battle scene is superb as a cast of thousands erupt across the screen and provide an indication that we are about to see a film that pays incredible attention to detail throughout its entirety. In every way, Scott has created a world for us that scuttles films of similar epic undertakings (and budgets!) and sends them to their dooms at the bottom of the murky depths of film history where they belong.The cast is generally very strong. Crowe proves himself very suitable to the task with a great emotional range and depth of character. His accent ocassionally bugged me (as did the mish mash of accents on offer - but that is I guess a legacy of 'internationally casted films'), but this aside, he was well and truly up to the task. Phoenix is also excellent as the disturbed Commodus, as is Nielson as Lucilla, the daughter of Marcus who ""should have been a son"" and finds herself torn between loyalty to her brother and doing what is 'right'. The old guard thesps of Harris, Reed and Jacobi (Grachus) are uniformly strong as supporting characters, and Spencer Treat Clark (Lucius) does a fine job as the young heir to the throne.Add to this great cast excellent editing and post production work, and an intricate soundscape (including a magnificent Hans Zimmer score), and you have a film that, despite its length, was highly palatable and had me in there from beginning to end. A must see."
Gladiator,19-Aug-00,"This is wonderful storytelling.  The opening Battle Scene simply mesmerizes, showing the brutal nature of combat for Roman conquests.  I went back to see the film again.  The first time I didn't hear anything Crowe said before the battle.  I was just too visually caught-up.  The second time I listened very closely and caught the wise yet succinct line from Maximus ""what we do in life... echoes in eternity.""  Awesome.A simple man v. an emperor.  I just loved the resilience Maximus showed throughout the movie.  I find in most movies, there is an irritatingly slow process where the character has to ""find himself,"" not so with Gladiator. Maximus does what is needed.I liked how there were only two or three issues within this film.  One was the afterlife.  Aspects of the afterlife are opened, but not overdone.  Love of family is given sizable focus. I liked the theme of love of country that we see as well, although it may not be justly deserved, it is never questioned.The visual effects were amazing.  It actually had me wanting to believe that's the way Rome actually looked in all it's glory.  The battle of Carthage reenactment was really great.The ending is just hypnotic. Intentionally or unintentionally it was simply emotional.  The music is wonderfully beautiful as if Maximus' family are telling him...you have arrived.Bottom line: magnificent.  Visually and emotionally satisfying."
Gladiator,07-Sep-02,"I love history, and to me, Gladiator is a masterpiece. It is the most accurate picture of the Roman Empire Hollywood has ever put out.  People declare Spartacus a masterpiece, but Gladiator far outdoes Spartacus in quality.  The costuming, the acting, the screenplay, the scenery, and the fighting styles made me think that I had traveled back to 180 A.D. Russell Crowe is a true Hollywood tough guy, and he is superb in this movie. Joaquin Phoenix is outstanding as a villain, one of the best in movie history.  He played his character as if it were a psychologist's dream case. Connie Nielsen plays one of the strongest female characters that I have ever seen.  The choreographer of the action sequences was brilliant. Ridley Scott did an outstanding job in recreating the Empire, including the multitude of ethnic groups within the Empire and accurately depicting everyday life.  If you're looking for insight into what the Roman Empire was like, this is a perfect depiction."
Gladiator,08-Nov-05,"Gladiator! A thrilling tale of a Roman general who must battle against all thinkable odds to avenge the death of his family and restore justice to the empire. The plot is simple, legendary general Maximus Decimus Meridius, after many victorious campaigns and battles wants to return to his peaceful home in Spain, However the kind, fair and dying Emperor Marcus Aurelius wishes to bestow his title on him over his cruel son, Commodus. Commodus is understandably annoyed and kills his father calming the title of Emperor. Maximus is sentenced to death along with the rest of his family back at his home in Spain. Maximus escapes but is unable to save his wife and son. His loss of will to live makes him an east target for slavers and he is soon sold as a gladiator. He fights his way into the coliseum in Rome were he wins over the crowd and uses his celebrity status to defy the Emperor, to whom he swears his vengeance for the death of his family, after many battles and political backstabbing he gets his chance to fight the Emperor in the Arena.This is just such an amazing film, it captures every emotion possible in only the way an expert director can achieve, we can go on for whole scenes without the need for speaking, everything is told through the genuine body language and expressions. And when there is conversing we get such emotion and wonderfully powerful quotes  ""What we do in life, echoes in eternity"" Wow.The opening scene is spellbinding, showing the true gore of battle, the fight scenes are marvellously realistic, discarding the popular ""pretty"" sword fighting for brutal aggressive force. The audience in the arena express every emotion, surprise, anger, and enjoyment. The cast is brilliantly chosen; we can really see Russell Crowe as a gladiator, in Commodus, Joaquin Phoenix gives us a man we can really hate, Connie Nielson shows real emotion and passion in the role of Lucilla. So apart from the spellbinding acting, scarily realistic fight scenes and the amazing script, what else can we look for? The music is just stunning, its exactly what we need brought in at exactly the right time, truly wonderful directing. And then we have the stunning special effects, we can really visualise the greatness that is Rome, the fight scenes really make you believe. Some critics have condemned the lack of historical fact, for instance an emperor would never fight a gladiator, and these comments cannot be denied, its true.But I think we can forgive them that one fault for such an amazing movie. Without hesitation I give this movie a truly deserved 10/10!"
Gladiator,06-Mar-02,"I borrowed this movie on DVD, but I wish I had seen it in the theater for it would have been a lot more fun and powerful there. Despite this, Gladiator is one of the most powerful and moving films I've ever seen. The plot goes so smooth together, as well as the acting and the terrific musical score. Director Ridley Scott puts all effort into making this film an epic, and he does just that. I'd have to say that anyone who likes Ridley Scott (I sure do) should see this. It is a lot like Ridley's other movies (Black Hawk Down was also amazing). If you can stand a little bit--well, ok a LOT of blood and gore, then you should see this. Russell Crowe shows an excellent performance like no other. I don't think there's one bad movie that Ridley Scott has made or that Russell Crowe has acted in. The fact that the brutal battles involving innocent slaves in this film actually happened in real life centuries ago makes it even more interesting and powerful. Emperor Commodus is a truely evil and life-like villian who shows a lot of his wits in attempts to get his revenge against Maximus.Ridley Scott went to many different locations to shoot this film to make it real, and he does. The film is set in Rome, and it looks just like it. You feel as if you are there in the crowd, hearing them cheer and cheer to see the death. To some of you, this may sound a little barbaric, and believe me the film is VERY barbaric and brutual, however it teaches a very strong lesson of what happens when an economy turns as violent as Rome was. Ridley Scott goes to many lengths to make this movie real, because even though the characters are fictitious, all of this really did happen. Innocent people had to go through brutual fighting while thousands of people cheered for either their death or the enemy's death. If you were an inexperienced fighter, chances are you would get killed. But the strange thing is that Rome LOVED this. People came from all over to see these fights and to see the blood that was shed, that is why you can't blame the characters in this film for being so forlorn and saddened the whole time. The film itself is very dark. The theme is dark and the ending is dark. From beginning to end there is excessive violence (for those action movie-goers, this is a movie for you). But if the violence is concerning you, don't let it. The special effects make the movie great, but it's the acting and storyline that make it spectacular. HIGHLY RECCOMMENDED for anyone who wants a good time. Definitely makes you think. ***** out of *****."
Gladiator,01-Nov-06,"An intense Roman epic, a la ""Ben-Hur"" or ""Spartacus,"" it was nice to see something like this made again. It had been since the 1960s that we had seen a 3-hour extravaganza like this.Like Ben-Hur, this is a story of a successful man who loses everything thanks to an evil man, and then has to fight his way back up to seek revenge on that man and to obtain his freedom back. It's a tried-and-true formula. This movie doesn't go to excess on the violence as some of the other more recent epic films did, such as ""Braveheart"" or ""The Patriot.""The acting is excellent, beginning with Russell Crowe, who has established himself as one of the best actors of today. Joaquin Phoenix also put himself ""on the map"" as an actor with his portrayal of the evil ""Commodus."" He's so annoying you want to slap that sucker, which means he's doing a good job acting. Kudos to the rest of the cast, too.Too bad they don't make more of these type of films, as they did in the 1950s and 1960s."
Gladiator,25-Oct-05,"When you go to the ruins of Rome now, you get really no sense of the scale and the grandeur of what that forum would have been It's hard to get it anywhere except from some of the great epic films of the past like ""Quo Vadis,"" ""Ben-Hur,"" ""Demetrius and the Gladiators,"" ""Barabbas,"" and ""The Fall of the Roman Empire."" Scott's ""Gladiator"" is build around a mythic character, a man trying to find his way home... It is around someone finding inner strength in a tough time Maximus is somebody who doesn't want to be a soldier We realize this is a man who is pursuing the ultimate which is transcending death and finding love after death which completely transforms your reaction to the man, a man who is very, very strong but very, very loving The plot, familiar from Anthony Mann's "" Fall of the Roman Empire,"" had Crowe as Maximus, the proud well-loved Roman general in the army of Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris). Maximus whose motto is 'Strength and Honor' is like a son to Aurelius, a statement that left Aurelius' own son, Commodus perturbed...Disappointed by the news that his father privately decides to name Maximus his successor, and being a young ambitious son lusting for power, he murders his father, and orders a strike against the general... One of the best scenes of the motion picture is where Commodus is told by his father that he is not going to be the emperor Joaquin Phoenix is easy to hate in a frightening and vile character...Ridley Scott creates a lot of beautiful scenes between the characters He did some fantastic work in all of those wonderful scenes in the film But there's another moment between the emperor and his daughter Lucilla (the Danish beauty Connie Nielsen) that I loved very much Harris says, ""Let's not speak of politics. Let us pretend that you are a loving daughter and I'm a good father. "" They walk for a few seconds and Lucilla says, ""This is a pleasant fiction."" I felt this short scene so sophisticated It seemed to me wonderfully insightful, simple in terms of amount of words, but complex in terms of understanding this strange relationship One of the most successful bits of casting was Oliver Reed He's a harsh and rough businessman who makes his living off the death machine and yet, inside, there was some kind of ethical person that would come out at the right momentRidley Scott's epic film does not romanticize a democratic Golden Age of Rome but a decaying, blood thirsty empire on the edge of its fall... Through its beautiful music, through Russell's performance and through Ridley's soulfulness, ""Gladiator"" brought a poetic vision in a new and very cinematically richly way that really gave the audience something different, so emotional and so intimate"
Gladiator,16-May-00,"Germania, 150 AD, the setting of Gladiator's opening scene. Far from the blazing sun and dazzlingly beauty of ancient Rome, Ridley Scott shoots the opening sequence in a subdued light. The Roman legions are nonetheless impeccably turned out as they face the comparatively disorganised rabble that inhabits this miserable environment. Caesar's soldiers seem somewhat misplaced here. However, Russell Crowe is at home in this environment of knee-deep mud and merciless snow. He commands the screen with all the virtues of his motto: Strength and Honour.'The plot, with its hero-to-zero-to-hero nature, runs through Gladiator's every vein. As General Maximus, Russell Crowe is welcomed by Marcus Aurelius Caesar (Richard Harris) to take the Roman throne as Emperor of a new Republic. All does not run smoothly however as mislead heir to the throne Commodus (Phoenix) takes over Rome with ill-gotten domination, having dispatched his own Father. Maximus is cast out to find his family murdered and his Spanish farm burnt to the ground. Taken in as a slave by Proximo (Reed), Maximus becomes a Gladiator and starts his journey to the Coliseum and revenge against Commodus.Scott's cast is powerful and he is not left wanting as powerful performances are delivered by all. Due to his untimely mid-production death, Oliver Reed is created in some scenes by the grace of computer graphics, which are as convincing as they come; sometimes making it difficult to differentiate between Reed himself and his computerised counterpart.
It is, however, the supporting actors who create many of Gladiator's best dialogue-based scenes. In an accomplished demonstration of her acting ability as Lucilla, Connie Nielsen saves the occasional scene as Joaquim Phoenix shows us that he can do evil', but is less convincing when it comes to the more emotional qualities of his role.As a vehicle for the plot, Scott's beautifully created and highly symbolic (there is an image of fire in nearly every shot of the film) dialogue scenes are of a certain merit with digitally created backgrounds that encompass the meticulous nature of the Roman Empire. However, dialogue alone does not an epic movie make, and it is in the film's spectacular action sequences that Gladiator come into its own. Shot on location in Malta, Scott's first arena was built by an army of locals and commanded some 5000 extras (a large majority of whom were of a cardboard variety). All of this pales in comparison as we arrive in a digitally created Rome which makes some scenes in Ben Hur some somewhat small scale. The Coliseum is immense, both inside and out, and the computerised provides the electric atmosphere in which Crowe and his feline companions (four sizeable, and real, Bengal tigers) perform.The battle sequences are perfectly choreographed and shot as iconic masks and typically Roman chariots are abundant in their power and imagery. As swords clash and heads roll, Ridley Scott is triumphant in the application of special effects technology and his directorial prowess.Always one to embrace technology, Scott's views over Rome's landscape are reminiscent of the beautifully created cityscape of Blade Runner. This is a film that fears so little and boasts so much, even a lady archer being sliced clean in half by a spiked chariot wheel!All those involved with Gladiator should be delighted and confident with their creation, for indeed this is a convincing and enthralling display with epic proportions to take the wind from James Cameron's titanic sails."
Gladiator,24-Oct-05,"This movie is awesome! I think it's great to be in one of IMDb's top 250 best movies, because it deserves it. Every time I watch 'Gladiator'I stay touched by the story and I never get bored of it.It's one of the most excellent movies already made in the movie's history! Russel Crowe is terrific in the role of Maximus and so is Joaquim phoenix great as commodus. For people who enjoys history,specially ancient history,is a chance to see how was Rome many centuries ago, and also know better about the gladiators, the Colosseum and how some things worked in that time.I will not write about the plot here, because many people already did this; I will only say for people that never watched this movie, that it deserves to be watched and, if you have some money, buy the DVD!"
Gladiator,07-Dec-05,"If only Peter Jackson hadn't come along and done a rather good trilogy of films, we might possibly be talking about the greatest film of the 21st Century so far. Its sweeping but simplistic heroic tale, crunching fight scenes, award-winning special effects, towering acting and soaring score set this film apart from all the pretenders that followed it. Ridley Scott single-handedly re-invented the epic genre with this story of a Roman solider who is betrayed, loses everything and is sold into slavery, only to fight his way back as a gladiator, all the while driven by vengeance for his murdered family.Russell Crowe gives quite simply the performance of a lifetime as the Gladiator Maximus, one that deservedly won him Best Actor at the 2000 Academy Awards (although his performance in the following year's Beautiful Mind was arguably even better, even if it didn't win him his second consecutive Oscar), and provided a thinking woman's alternative to the likes of Pitt, Cruise and Clooney to swoon over. His gravely voice and impressive physique combine to give him a huge presence, which literally fills the screen. His dialogue is sparing, but his actions speak far louder, adding a stoic sadness to his vengeance-driven heroic character. Before Gladiator, Crowe was a good secondary actor; after Gladiator he was catapulted to the top of Hollywood's A-list, and remains there, thanks to this career-making performance proving him to be one of the finest actors of his generation.Joaquin Phoenix is fantastic as the scheming and corrupt Emperor Commodus who betrays Maximus and has his family killed. He manages to be delightfully and totally evil without ever descending into the realms of pantomime villain, which is a tricky line to walk, and manages to avoid being overshadowed by Crowe's monumental performance.The fight scenes are rousing and superbly choreographed, in particular a scene where Maximus marshals his fellow slaves into an army against marauding chariot archers in the Colosseum. The dialogue is kept simple and never overbearing (no need to worry why all of Europe speaks the same language) and culminates in one of the most memorable pieces of script that is destined to join the ranks of 'Play it Sam' and 'Are you talking' to me' as one of the most quoted (and misquoted) lines in movie history  although it is rather wordy. But here it is, in full; 'My name is Maximus Decimus Meridius. Commander of the Armies of the North, General of the Felix Legions, loyal servant to the true Emperor Marcus Aurelius; Father to a murdered son, husband to a murdered wife, and I will have my vengeance, in this life or the next.' As Crowe turns to the Emperor in the arena and delivers this line, it proves to be one of the most electrifying moments in cinema history  hairs will stand up, spines will tingle, guaranteed.The action is set to some truly beautiful music, and it is shameful Hans Zimmer missed out on the Oscar for Best Score. Ridley Scott was similarly unlucky in the Director category.The film is however tinged with sadness, as it proved to be the final (but triumphant) swansong for the careers of Oliver Reed and Richard Harris, both of whom died shortly after making this film. Neither could have delivered much finer performances, and if any performance had to be a final one, both delivered one worthy of such a status here. Reed in particular is a revelation, reminding older generations and showing a new generation of his considerable talent.An inspiring film, rousing, exhilarating, exciting and moving. Superbly acted, directed, scored and visualised. A tribute to how great films could be once, and could be again."
Gladiator,19-Nov-05,"There is so little to find wanting in this film and not wanting to merely repeat its many deserved praises, all I can do is question a couple of historical points.It is unlikely that a Roman general would be sold into slavery and forced to fight in the arena. Exiled, yes. Killed maybe. Asked to commit suicide to retain his property, most likely. It is unlikely that he would return to find his family crucified, of all things. Romans were very specific about who got crucified and why. Romans usually avoided it, no matter how cruel the tyrant(?) was.Roman legionnaires would NEVER have a tattoo unless they were barbarians who got one BEFORE joining a legion. Marking or mutilating the human body was expressedly anti- Roman. No statue or depiction exists of a main-period Roman showing a body-marking. The bonding feature the writer was attempting was an inappropriate borrowing from the 20th century German SS.Great entertaining movie nonetheless."
Gladiator,24-Mar-02,"The beginning of ""Gladiator"" is powerful. We see the Roman Legion fighting against the Germanic tribes in what surely must be one of the most spectacular battle scenes ever filmed; one which truly does give the viewer a taste of what warfare in that era must have been like. The ending is powerful, as the quest for vengeance finally comes to a head, with General Maximus facing the Emperor Commodus in a gladiatorial contest in the Roman arena. In between - well - things could have been a little better.The acting in this movie, I thought, was first-rate. Russell Crowe as General Maximus, Joaquin Phoenix as Emperor Commodus and Connie Nielsen as Lucilla, sister of Commodus, all played their parts perfectly. The gladiatorial bouts were superbly choreographed. The set decoration was magnificent, and looked exactly as I would expect Imperial Rome to have looked. So, why do I say this could have been better?(POSSIBLE SPOILERS)Basically, the whole thing was just a bit too clear-cut for me. Maximus was too obviously the good guy, Commodus too obviously the bad guy. With this being so clear, we know that the movie must be heading for the final confrontation between the two, and it makes watching the middle 90 minutes or so difficult. ""Get on with it,"" I found myself thinking from time to time. It didn't have to be quite so clear cut. The potential was there to give the viewer a real ethical choice to make. I mean, one can understand Commodus being angry when Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) - his father - takes away the throne that Commodus had believed all his life would be his, and hands control of Rome over to Maximus. Commodus could have been a sympathetic character. He didn't have to murder his father. His father was elderly; a natural death wouldn't have been out of the question. And why the incestuous fascination with Lucilla? I didn't think it added anything to the movie - except to make Commodus even more repulsive. In the end, the movie didn't make me think about anything; it didn't challenge me with any moral decision-making; it didn't make choosing sides in this battle even remotely difficult.Don't get me wrong. This was a very good movie. One can always argue whether this movie or that should have been named best picture; one certainly has to agree that ""Gladiator"" was worthy of consideration. I just felt it could have been better. In the end, I give it a rating of 7/10."
Gladiator,21-Apr-19,"Gladiator is not just director Ridley Scott's ultimate masterpiece ( And i am also keeping the fantastic Alien & Blade Runner in mind when i say this ), it is also undoubtedly one of the most viscerally effective and emotionally compelling of motion pictures ever made.It plays somewhat like a modern Ben-Hur, as a very respectable character is forced into slavery due to him standing up for what is right. Of course, being a much more modern epic, the editing is a lot quicker, as is the entire pace of the picture. However,with 171 minutes playtime in the extended edition, Scott doesn't haste through this picture, and takes his time to set up his characters & their respective arcs. Gladiator is however not a flawless film, as several action sequences ( Particularly in the introduction in the battle of Germania ) feature quite a lot of shaky cam and quick editing, but admittedly this is nowhere near as bad as something like Taken or The Bourne Trilogy. Most of the action sequences are superbly edited, with widescreen shots to create an overview, combined with mediums to immerse the viewer into the action. A couple of times there is a shakycam shot in the middle of this, but it's a very minor issue. Another minor fault is in some of the backdrops. The 'Am i not merciful' scene features an obvious greenscreen, saturated a bit too brightly, and Proximo is obviously not physically there near the end of the film ( When actor Oliver Reed had already died ). Again these minor issues feature only in 1 scene respectively, and therefore do not really do anything to truly diminish the cinematic power that Gladiator provides.On the whole, the cinematography & art direction of Gladiator is impeccable. It is not the best, since as stated before there are a couple of lesser backdrops easily recognizable as greenscreens, but for most of the picture the viewer is subjected to beautiful angles, backdrops & sets. The scenes in Zuccabar are an example of the seductive natural beauty Gladiator provides, and Maximus's ride to his family after his execution attempt also feature some stunning environmental shots. Sets are elegantly crafted and varied in a beautiful color palette, becoming most apparent in Commodus's & Lucilla's scenes. The titanic image of the Colosseum is also one that is difficult to get rid of, despite the fact that i believe it was filmed in full CGI, but apart from perhaps the absolute final shot ( Burying the sculptures ), that is hardly noticable.The art of acting is utilized at its finest in Gladiator, with three absolute superb performances by leads Russel Crowe as Maximus, Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus & Connie Nielsen as Lucilla. Not to mention the fantastic supporting performances of legendary actor Richard Harris & Oliver Reed. Crowe is the epitome of a brick of stoic masculinity, yet he gave an utterly convincing and extended sob fest when gazing upon the sight of his crucified family, showing us his versatility as an actor. We see him win a battle against Germanians through his discipline, intelligence and courage, and we are rooting for his character from this moment forth. He is in his heart a simple man that just wants to go home to his family, but he is also honor bound to Rome, and proves this through his courageous actions. Not interested by the corruptions of power, he lives only to see justice done. Phoenix is superb as the corrupted emperor, showing us his envy of Maximus simply with one look into the eyes ( Look at Phoenix's superb facial acting in the scene where Maximus reveals himself to him in the arena ), his arrogance & his brutality. Nielsen is also quite underrated, as her disguised fear during every scene with her brother after their father's death is a stunning feat of acting within acting, culminating with her utter terror at the end when Commodus demands a 'pure blood' heir with her.Of course one cannot forget Hans Zimmer's fantastic contribution to his masterpiece, creating arguably his finest score to date, with this especially being the case during the transition between the (Again) 'Am i not merciful' scene and the shots of the arena. Obviously 'Now we are free' is also one of the most emotionally powerful scores ever created. It is also one of Zimmer's most varied scores, as a slight criticism of him is often his repeated melodies ( Admittedly, a lot of the themes in Gladiator still sound similar to The Rock, but a lot of them also do not ). In any case, it is rare to imagine the brilliance and emotional resonance of Gladiator without Zimmer's score.While the narrative is fairly straightforward as a revenge story, the dialogue written is superb, with many incredible lines such as 'What we do in life, echoes in eternity', not to mention the slow character development and character arcs, even within seemingly minor characters like Proximo & Quintus ( You will need to see the extended edition to witness Quintus's arc ) who have their original ideals challenged and overcome throughout the events in the film. Even though Maximus's sole purpose in life has become to kill Commodus in revenge for his family, it is in a way a very hopeful film. A film about standing up for what is right, and being granted redemption and a reunion with loved ones in the end. Maximus does not want to rule Rome, but in slaying Commodus, he secures the feature of it for is people, while also acquiring his personal goal. He demands respect for his valor and his morals throughout the film, and this makes sure that we as an audience are emotionally drained by the time he enters the Elysium fields, and is hailed as a hero by the people of Rome, and a hero he was.One of the all-time greats of epic motion pictures, Gladiator features impeccable acting, writing ,cinematography, art direction & a phenomenal original score. It also features possibly the most relatable main character ever written, which is partly why there are very little films that can equal the emotional power that Gladiator creates."
Gladiator,13-Jun-01,"Firstly, Romans never referred to the Colloseum as the ""Colloseum"".  It was called the Flavian Amphitheatre.Commodus was an actual emperor who ruled from A.D. 180 to 192.  He did indeed fight in the Colloseum against gladiators, and was quite good at it because he never lost (Maybe he cheated like in the movie).His sister, Lucilla, did conspire with his wife Crispina to have him killed. They were caught and banished to an island and later killed.His mistress Marcia tried to drug him to death but failed, so they had some athlete strangle him to death.  He died on New Year's Eve A.D. 192.He was a nut case, and was quite murderous, but that's about the only things real about the movie.Other than the historical problems, the story was great.  I liked Maximus and really hated Commodus.  It was your basic struggle between good and evil."
Gladiator,29-Mar-02,"There is much to appreciate about about this picture but at the same time there is much to castigate as well. What could have been a thoroughly involving story turns out to be crippled by a lean script, some very indecisive direction and choppy editing. Not to mention some bad casting in the form of Richard Harris as Marcus Aurelius, a role which cries out to have been the last role played by Anthony Quinn.The film starts out well and looks bleakly authentic in its depiction of the pivotal battle in the wars between the barbarian tribes of Germania and the Roman Empire. But as the story gives way to 40 minutes of exposition following Commodus and Lucilla's introduction, Ridley Scott seems to tack things on whenever the script runs into weak spots. This leaves the film without a flowing narrative and it seems to want to please a mindless summer movie action market while at the same time aspiring to be something deeper. What it leaves us with is a schizophrenic, unequivocal story full of contradictions. There seems to be an epidemic in the past three or four years - films like this, Titanic, The Patriot, Pearl Harbor, Enemy at the Gates etc, try hard to be great epic films but at their core they are very slight and even trivial. The story in Gladiator holds promise but what little conflict there is set up and thrown at us in the first hour, leaving just a linear resolution to unfold for the remainder. A shame because so many elements could have been introduced in this story to make it truly an awesome and thoughtful epic. I guess complex stories like Spartacus and Ben-Hur will never be made again. This one falls somewhere short, though better than Demitrius and the Gladiators and the film it heavily borrows its narrative structure from - The fall of the Roman Empire.Technically the CGI is at times seamless and other times poor. When our troop of Gladiators run into the colosseum for the first time however the effect is absolutely jaw dropping and the scene that follows certainly delivers the action goods. The acting is very good throughout except for Tomas Arana as Quintus (about as bad as John Dall in Spartacus) and the aforementioned Richard Harris. Like Braveheart, not a bad entertainment experience but highly Hollywoodized and with an uneven narrative. But unlike Braveheart, the ending to Gladiator is a just a little embarrassing as it rips off both Braveheart and Titanic to far less effect. If you can get past the flaws, not the worst Roman spectacle on offer. Too highly rated at 8.1/10."
Gladiator,27-Apr-14,"You have to watch this movie at least 3 times in your life: First time - in puberty for the special effects and epic battles. Like the little Lucius, this movie will likely make you to dream of being a gladiator.Second time - in your 30's for the love, life choices and loses. This is the time when you fight all your battles for yourself and your family. Like Maximus you will dream to get out of your Colosseum and break the chains.Third time - when you feel your life is close to an end - just to remember what you have achieved. Like the old emperor Marcus Aurelius you will have to realize if your name would be remembered or forgotten forever. Is your family close to you in your final hours or you are going to see them in the afterlife. Have you been a good parent?I really enjoy this movie every time I watch it."
Frozen II,01-Dec-19,"I'm 34 years old. I loved the first one. Saw it three times in theaters. Immediately bought the soundtrack afterward.The first one had me on my toes the whole time. The story progressed smoothly. The songs had purpose. The theme of ""let it go"" was relatable.This sequel had none of that. They stuff a contrived story down your throat - having to explain everything at each step because nothing made sense. The songs are totally forgettable and filler. There is no meaningful conflict and the climax is non-existent.A real shame."
Frozen II,29-Dec-19,This movie is filled with songs all over the place because it has almost no story - same crap as Beauty and the beast 2.
Frozen II,08-Dec-19,"Your kids will love it, there's no doubt about that. There is serious talent behind the song writers and performers and animation team. The plotline itself is very well done, the issue was it's execution. For a film almost two hours long, everything was rushed. The film can only be described as an outline on paper that was made into film without the flesh between. Frozen 2 hardly gave the audience time to process one scene before we were thrown into another. Character motivations and emotions were traded for comedy relief in the form of Olaf, the sentient equivalent of ""exposition"".This film fails to narrate how a character got to a certain point, why this and that transpired, and the motivations behind each party, however overly narrates the message of the film quite literally through Olaf exposition as mentioned above.After being such a strong character in the first installment, Anna fell short and her emotions were conflicting (and not in the good way). Kristoff's only purpose in the film was to find a way to ask Anna a very serious question, Olaf had no other purpose or journey and while Elsa's journey was the saving grace, the film portrayed itself as if it had cut out 30 minutes of important back story and character decision making. This film lacked the emotion of the first, a sense of thrill, dread, traded in for series of beautiful visuals and fluid animation.The score was good but not memorable. The animation was absolutely stunning. From a child's perspective, the film would be given a 10/10, but from a film review standpoint, Frozen 2 failed to deliver."
Frozen II,21-Nov-19,"Frozen II felt unsatisfying. There was lots of build up to a very short climax that felt way too easy and simple. I kept expecting another adventure which never came. The film feels short and unfinished. That said, the animation is absolutely gorgeous and I did find the film quite funny. If you go into this with low expectations I think you'll enjoy yourself."
Frozen II,22-Dec-19,"The animations where great, the story very poor.
It is better to have a great story and poor animations than the other way around. The story was needlessly complicated for children and not able to catch the audience."
Frozen II,22-Dec-19,"One incoherent nonsense mess that felt like the story was being made up as it went along. The end credits with about 6-8 different writers perhaps explained the reason for that.Nothing like the first movie based on Hans Christian Anderson's Snow Queen. No charm and characters such as Olaf were simply irritating and I couldn't care if any of them would have lived or died except for Kristoff. When the movie was trying to produce drama and characters were crying I felt nothing.Kristoff's song ""Lost in the woods"" and sequence were pretty good, the rest of the movie consisted of completely irritating songs that lacked rhyming where necessary. A character will start singing and I was thinking ""oh no, not another song"". How long is this going on for?Gets a 2 from me, literally one point above minimum for Kristoff's song.Totally doesn't deserve the success it's had. Patronising nonsense. 6 years in the making and this is just a complete disgrace."
Frozen II,21-Nov-19,"Before I say anything, let me tell you that some girls were crying around my seats, so I think movie hits its demograhy.I liked the visuals of the movie, it looks amazing, better than first one. There's lot more going on happening in the movie and it's just 1hour 50 mins long, so a lot of arcs are very rushed and convenient. There are scenea where one character tells the other that this is what they have to do, to get something, with no explanation or reasons. There's lot of, I mean lots of, exposition. Characters tell the stories, tell something they just know or feel and flashbacks or hallucinations kind-of stuff.But this is a movie aimed to kids, and it's okay if the story wasn't technically sound. But for adults, this movie might be too silly at times.About the songs, this time expectations were high, and I didn't like a single song from movie. There were times when I felt they just ripped off their own song from previous movie, let it go. Like last time, no song connected emotiolly with the character, but they're well performed.Kudos to animation team, voice actors, art-designers.
Not so much for writers and screen play writers."
Frozen II,02-Dec-19,"Wooden dialogue was otherwise we'll delivered. An excessive number of outright bad songs (with only one exception) were none the less well sung.Character arcs and motivations were rudimentary, though at least they were not out-of-character. Yet the overall narrative barely held together as a coherent story, from its entirely literal call to adventure then through one contrived conflict and convenient solution after another, ending a series of underwhelming climaxes.Poor writing was the problem, the screenwriting and the songwriting. There were decent ideas throughout the film that consistently failed in their implementation. It made for a film trying but failing to punch well above it's weight, more like a direct-to-video Aladdin sequel with higher production values then the unexpected breakout success of Frozen."
Frozen II,30-Dec-19,"In a nutshell, Elsa becomes an airbender. The first 10 minutes, which are incredibly rushed, reveal far too much, leaving the audience in disappointment as to the build up. Were given our mission, and our characters.The four main obstacles occur to about 20 minutes of the run time total, with the rest of the film being (for a lack of better description) 'nothingy.' there was a big missed opportunity for else and Anna to explore the kingdom, but instead Disney decided to make it all the same. Granted, there was a cool shipwreck and some nice features such as the bridge, but the world was rather disappointingly plain.The final battle (although looking stunning) was nothing special. The build up and the soundtrack truly big it up too much. Not to mention the songs, so forgettable and do many of them. Whilst ""let it go"" was never my thing, it was catchy, and easy to sing along to. With the sequels ""into the unknown"" being (questionably) the main song, it's surprisingly drab.And finally theres the cliche ending of them all living happily ever after, but with the proposal added in as another unnecessary event to make the audience scream ""awh!""There were some good things however, being the overall pleasant nature-esque aesthetic. and the animation does look brilliant as well. Even Olaf had a few comedic moments too. Other than that, it was a huge mess if a plot, with wrong priorities, an over the top story, and possibly the most disappointing movie of the year."
Frozen II,04-Jul-20,"This movie was unfortunately set up to fail. When a movie is stupidly successful like the first movie was a sequel will really struggle and I think this one does.This movies plot is more complex than the originals and I don't think it does it any favours. It adds elements that are so unnecessary like a forbidden love for characters that we haven't really met or care about.It also really leaves most of its characters out to dry. Everyone apart from Elsa is completely useless in this movie they could literally have been cut and nothing would have mattered and it's a shame that they didn't find anything to do with them apart from them dealing with their own issues that are strange and trivial and nothing to do with the original plot and don't really have a resolution.The songs are really nothing to write home about. They are really boring and charmless. The original movies songs had such character and life and these songs are just like ""well I guess we have to sing now"". They had one ace and they blew it in the first 15-20 minutes which I don't understand as they must have knew it was the only song as they got a big name to cover it for the credits.Also it doesn't shock me but Disney had an opportunity to make a statement with this movie and they let it flop. Everyone wanted them to make Elsa not straight and they didn't. It was just basic.I will say it looked pretty and I liked one song but would I ever watch it again absolutely not."
Frozen II,20-Nov-19,"(This has a post-credit scene in case you're wondering)The songs are great. Especially Kristoff's song, an 80's jam as Jonathan Groff would say it. Even the animation looks like an 80's music video which I find funny. Olaf's comedic skits are even funnier. For Into the Unknown, not as catchy as Let it Go but time will tell. The animation, the best. Elsa got even beautifuller. If you saw the water animation you would see *much* more of that. The story is bigger, questions are answered, but there are some points that look silly. The plot is predictable but personally I enjoyed it.The only thing I'm having a hard time agreeing with is the ending."
Frozen II,01-Dec-19,"I had high hopes for this movie to be honest. I'm not the biggest fan of the first movie but that one seems like a masterpiece compared to this.
What was the point of Elsa accepting her role as the Queen in the first movie if she was just going to live in a magical forest at the end?
I get that they tried to give her powers a backstory but it just feels so forced and off, the worldbuilding they tried to do doesn't feel natural.
It felt like there were so many things missing, there was no evil that had to be defeated, no big character arc, nothing. Everything happened so fast and then it was just over. The entire movie acts like there's gonna be this big climax that's gonna make everything worthwhile but that doesn't happen."
Frozen II,14-Nov-19,"It's not hard to imagine how big this movie will be. I, as well as many others, am a huge fan of the first film and the short films that followed it. Frozen II has a different feel to it. While the first film was brimming with quirky moments, the follow up feels a little more mature in its plot and themes. This story heavily centers around the importance of change, even if that means letting go. Throughout the film, I found myself dazzled with the quality and beauty of the visuals that the animation team laid out. The story, for me, felt a little flat, however. I think the writing team missed the mark when trying to achieve the same quirkiness from the original. With the more dramatic path the writers chose to take, also came more epic musical numbers and effects. Sure there were still plenty of humorous moments, but I personally felt myself longing for more. I also find irony in the fact that this film centers around change and the overall feel of the film felt like a major shift from the first. I do think this film will still appeal to many others and I, myself, am still very excited to watch it a second time. Overall, I'd say this film found success in what it was trying to achieve and the message it was trying to send to its viewers, but couldn't quite live up to the whimsicality of the original. While not as good as the first, it's still a film you will want to take your family to and is a great addition to the Frozen franchise. 7/10"
Frozen II,23-Nov-19,"This is a beautiful movie, and Elsa's journey is a powerful one to watch. But outside of this it's narrative is completely unfocused and none of the character moments are given the time they deserve on screen. It seems that it's trying to be more adult with more lore and a darker tone, but also still gives Olaf an unnecessary about of screen time doing things that the little kids would laugh at. The pacing also feels quite rushed, even by kids movie standards. You could have cut 20 minutes out of this movie and it would have been just as good."
Frozen II,24-Nov-19,"Way too many songs, none of them were catchy like let it go
The water horse didn't make sense and was unexplained
The secondary characters are so forgettable you probably already forgot they existed
The Olaf dying scene was unnecessary, even kids knew he would come back
The most memorable moment of this movie was when it ended I saw like 20 people in the cinema waking up, more than half of the cinema room fall asleep YES ITS THAT BAD."
Frozen II,22-Nov-19,"As much as I hate to say this, aside from the gorgeous visuals, the plot; third act, was VERY poor. Nothing really happens. There is no threat, no villain, no obstacle...Elsa wanders off to a 'fortress of solitude' type place where she dies? or freezes? Anna sings about her grief, the song itself was great but I couldn't feel anything for her because Elsa's outcome was very ambiguous? Anna is set out to do something that could set Elsa free but....there are no consequences which was mentioned about a hundred times...""the water will destroy Arendelle..."" and all of a sudden Elsa comes out of nowhere and stops the flood. It was too rushed, and the plot itself was not fulfilling, AT ALL."
Frozen II,15-Dec-19,"Well i think this is the worst movie sequel, this movie destroyed the first one. If you see the trailer you think that the movie will be awesome. NOT EVEN CLOSE MY FRIEND. All the main characters apart from Olaf are changed, what i mean...Well Anna is so annoying, all the time she is complaining and Christoffer is not
brave and active in this movie the only thing he's thinking is how to ask Anna to marry him. Elsa is so... sensitive and not independent at all. Also the plot isn't exist, all the time they're singing and the end is a trash. I'll try to forget this movie and keep in my mind only the first movie. If they had tried more maybe the movie was nice."
Frozen II,02-Dec-19,"Disney's Frozen was truly a delightful surprise. It was an extravagant celebration of the studios' own legacy and its musical traditions from across the eras but no one expected it to be the phenomenon that it became & it left a cultural impact that was undeniably unforeseen. Six years later, Frozen II surfaces with hopes of repeating the same feat yet nearly everything about it is inferior to the original.A visually breathtaking yet narratively hollow sequel that lacks the freshness of the first film and is a step down in storytelling quality too, Frozen II does have a few things working in its favour but it is not the follow-up chapter that's able to validate its existence. The film is a passable effort at best that manages to mask its shortcomings with spellbinding animation but the effect doesn't last for long this time around.Unlike its predecessor, a lot of its musical numbers end up affecting the narrative flow and aren't that catchy either. Anna & Elsa's arc remains captivating, plus the sisterhood bond is strong as ever but the other characters, both new & returning, are a letdown. Even the humour goes downhill, diving into silliness at times, and the only aspect that keeps its afloat is the photorealistic animation that provides the film its mesmerising beauty.Devoid of the enchanting flavour & invigorating aura that made Frozen a classic for the new generation, Frozen II does steer into darker territory as it should and even had an interesting premise about mending the cracks left by forefathers in addition to Elsa's search for her origins but it fails to balance it all in a fascinating fashion and doesn't dig enough to strike a heartfelt chord. A rather safe attempt if anything, Walt Disney Animation's latest isn't worth the 6-year wait."
Frozen II,02-Jan-20,"Yes, some years have passed since the first movie, but why did the filmmakers found it important to tell the audience about the passing of time? Show, don't tell. And yet they have written songs dedicated to the fact that people get older, just in case anyone should be in doubt, even if it doesn't contribute any to the plot. What fairytales are concerned, Disney's movies have always been timeless. This time the story has a location in time, after photography was invented and was spreading through the world. Personal preferences, but I prefer it when fairytales are timeless and takes place in a pre-industrial society.And no, Norway has never had a pumpkin tradition during the various celebrations.We are told the enchanted forest is ""far away, as north as we can go"", and yet every location in the movie appears to be just some miles apart.The concept of water with memory will probably be good for business is you're a homeopath. The idea of a fifth elements that connects the other four has been used before; in the animated TV-show W.I.T.C.H., and the science fiction movie The Fifth Element.A little nitpicking; I get that salamanders often represents fire, and there is even a salamander called fire salamander. That species does not live in Norway, and if you go far enough north, there are zero salamanders. Not that the fire spirit in the movie behaved anything like a salamander. It was more like a lizard, including the licking of its eyes, which we often see in geckos. Most species don't have eyelids; instead their eyes are covered by transparent skin, which is why they have to use their tongue to keep them clean.Twice does the movie make fun of its predecessor; once when Olaf pretends to be Elsa, and once when she sees herself in the ice cave, where she is practically rejects her most famous song scene. There are many people out there which the first movie and that song means a lot for, and treating the scene like that, especially in the cave, is practically like a slap in their face.There is also the absence of logic. Why did the tribe of Northuldra, which lives as hunters and gatherers, or nomads at best (when they are not limited by a magical mist) believe they needed a dam? How did it made the forest suffer? Why couldn't the earth giants destroy it on their own initiative? Why did it affect the magic? It is never explained.Producer Peter Del Vecho said Disney was very careful to show respect for the sami people, which is the ones that inspired the Northuldra tribe. Too bad they didn't bother to show any respect for the native Norwegians. Sami and Norwegians have both populated the land long before the Norwegian nation itself came into existence, thousands of years ago. The sami have kept much of their original lifestyle, but that doesn't mean that the ethnic Norwegians doesn't have their own history, culture, identity, traditions and roots. Just like all other Europeans in their own countries.
There never were villages with a huge amount of non-western ethnicities. We never get an explanation what dark skinned people are doing there, so we are probably just supposed to roll with it. Because diversity, even in a time and place where it didn't exist. I expect Disney's upcoming movie Raya and the Last Dragon to have characters and villagers of all races, from Europeans to Africans. Well, not really, because the setting is Asian, and doing something like that would not be respectful. And did you notice any members of the Northuldra tribe that looked like they came from elsewhere?
Then there is the old cliché about the noble savages, for the lack of a better word; tribes that lives in complete harmony with nature. They are so wise, kind and just knows stuff, and are connected with the forces of nature. Unlike the cruel Norwegians in the movie, that are xenophobic, scared of magic, destroys nature, betray those who trust them and act like villains. It's not the first time in a Disney movie where Europeans act like that, for instance the Aryan stereotypical villains in Atlantis, but it is the firs time they are portrayed like that in their own country. Imagine if it was the other way around; it was the Northuldra tribe that did something like that to the people of Arendelle.
Progress and engineering is bad and have a negative impact on nature. Living like noble savages makes you a good person and connects you with magic. That's the lesson we learn. Is there ever praise for those cultures who have built their own country from scratch? Maybe, as long as they are not of European descent. When a story is about two of more different cultures, and one of the cultures is what we associate with Europa, Disney have a bad habit of portraying the latter in a negative light, and take liberties like turning medieval settings into modern day rainbow coalitions. And they don't even seem to realize how insulting it is."
Frozen II,22-Dec-19,"The story is both complicated and dull, and there isn't one memorable song in the whole movie. Also, there is no villain; a film like this needs a character whom you are dying to see punished for their wicked deeds (in Frozen 1 it was Prince Hans). Instead, we get political correctness shoved down our throats for the best part of two hours. The animation is great, but these days that's a given. And will somebody please take that snowman!!! He was irritating in the first movie but now he's unbearable. Very disappointing."
Frozen II,24-Nov-19,"Let me state before I go further, I loved the original. The original had heart, warmth, re playable songs. Maybe I saw the original too much and expected the same? Maybe between Frozen and Frozen 2 there were one too many shorts?I can't even tell you what the plot for Frozen 2 is about, and I just SAW it. The plot is literally all over the place. As everyone states, the only great thing about Frozen 2 is the superb animation,, but the story is dry.The songs are not memorable or catchy as the original. I didn't feel any love in Frozen 2, this definitely feels another quick "" let's make a fast Billion dollars again!"" Even the new actors feel ""miscasted"".Sterling K Brown, great actor, felt off in this. It felt there was poor direction."
Frozen II,02-Dec-19,Watched with me and my family and I can say movie was sooo crappy with songs every 10 mins. I believe there were more then 10 songs and most of it were irritating and boring. The plot was soo thin with no purpose. It is a very bad sequal in my honest brutal opinion. Do watch it if you want to sleep.
Frozen II,24-Nov-19,Skip It and keep the memories of the original frozen intact. Only good part was Olaf and his humour.
Frozen II,08-Mar-20,"Those who stated it doesn't have a storyline couldn't have watched the same film I did. Olaf struggling with growing-up is huge deal for kids and adults too. It's about loving each other and respecting what we have. It also teaches us to not let fear take over and create darkness. It teaches us to not judge! My god I could go on for ages! I'm in my 20s and loved this sequel, there was so much to take from it. All you have to do is listen"
Frozen II,27-Nov-19,"Rating 2.6/10
I will admit, I am not a fan of animated films, but this movie was not very entertaining even considering that. The story was silly and the progression of the story was very lazy. This movie had no magic, no emotion & no soul. The songs were atrocious !! I wouldn't watch it again, but a lot of people will probably like it."
Pulp Fiction,17-Nov-05,"One of the early scenes in ""Pulp Fiction"" features two hit-men discussing what a Big Mac is called in other countries. Their dialogue is witty and entertaining, and it's also disarming, because it makes these two thugs seem all too normal. If you didn't know better, you might assume these were regular guys having chit-chat on their way to work. Other than the comic payoff at the end of the scene, in which they use parts of this conversation to taunt their victims, their talk has no relevance to anything in the film, or to anything else, for that matter. Yet without such scenes, ""Pulp Fiction"" wouldn't be ""Pulp Fiction."" I get the sense that Tarantino put into the film whatever struck his fancy, and somehow the final product is not only coherent but wonderfully textured.It's no wonder that fans spend so much time debating what was in the suitcase, reading far more into the story than Tarantino probably intended. The film is so intricately structured, with so many astonishing details, many of which you won't pick up on the first viewing, that it seems to cry out for some deeper explanation. But there is no deeper explanation. ""Pulp Fiction,"" is, as the title indicates, purely an exercise in technique and style, albeit a brilliant and layered one. Containing numerous references to other films, it is like a great work of abstract art, or ""art about art."" It has all the characteristics we associate with great movies: fine writing, first-rate acting, unforgettable characters, and one of the most well-constructed narratives I've ever seen in a film. But to what end? The self-contained story does not seem to have bearing on anything but itself.The movie becomes a bit easier to understand once you realize that it's essentially a black comedy dressed up as a crime drama. Each of the three main story threads begins with a situation that could easily form the subplot of any standard gangster movie. But something always goes wrong, some small unexpected accident that causes the whole situation to come tumbling down, leading the increasingly desperate characters to absurd measures. Tarantino's originality stems from his ability to focus on small details and follow them where they lead, even if they move the story away from conventional plot developments.Perhaps no screenplay has ever found a better use for digressions. Indeed, the whole film seems to consist of digressions. No character ever says anything in a simple, straightforward manner. Jules could have simply told Yolanda, ""Be cool and no one's going to get hurt,"" which is just the type of line you'd find in a generic, run-of-the-mill action flick. Instead, he goes off on a tangent about what Fonzie is like. Tarantino savors every word of his characters, finding a potential wisecrack in every statement and infusing the dialogue with clever pop culture references. But the lines aren't just witty; they are full of intelligent observations about human behavior. Think of Mia's statement to Vincent, ""That's when you know you've found somebody special: when you can just shut the f--- up for a minute and comfortably enjoy the silence.""What is the movie's purpose exactly? I'm not sure, but it does deal a lot with the theme of power. Marsellus is the sort of character who looms over the entire film while being invisible most of the time. The whole point of the big date sequence, which happens to be my favorite section of the film, is the power that Marsellus has over his men without even being present. This power is what gets Vincent to act in ways you would not ordinarily expect from a dumb, stoned gangster faced with an attractive woman whose husband has gone away. The power theme also helps explain one of the more controversial aspects of the film, its liberal use of the N-word. In this film, the word isn't just used as an epithet to describe blacks: Jules, for instance, at one point applies the term to Vincent. It has more to do with power than with race. The powerful characters utter the word to express their dominance over weaker characters. Most of these gangsters are not racist in practice. Indeed, they are intermingled racially, and have achieved a level of equality that surpasses the habits of many law-abiding citizens in our society. They resort to racial epithets because it's a patter that establishes their separateness from the non-criminal world.There's a nice moral progression to the stories. We presume that Vincent hesitates to sleep with Mia out of fear rather than loyalty. Later, Butch's act of heroism could be motivated by honor, but we're never sure. The film ends, however, with Jules making a clear moral choice. Thus, the movie seems to be exploring whether violent outlaws can act other than for self-preservation.Still, it's hard to find much of a larger meaning tying together these eccentric set of stories. None of the stories are really ""about"" anything. They certainly are not about hit-men pontificating about burgers. Nor is the film really a satire or a farce, although it contains elements of both. At times, it feels like a tale that didn't need to be told, but for whatever reason this movie tells it and does a better job than most films of its kind, or of any other kind."
Pulp Fiction,24-Jul-14,"I can only speak for myself, but I had never seen anything as stylish, cleverly constructed, well written and electrifying as this milestone when I first saw it in 1994. What really pulled me in right from the start is what we've now come to know as a Tarantino trademark: the dialogue. When gangsters Jules and Vincent talk to each other (or all the other characters, for that matter) there is a natural flow, a sense of realism and yet something slightly over the top and very theatrical about their lines – it's a mixture that immediately grabs your attention (even if it's just two dudes talking about what kind of hamburger they prefer, or contemplating the value of a foot-massage). Then there's the music: the songs Tarantino chose for his masterpiece fit their respective scenes so perfectly that most of those pieces of music are now immediately associated with 'Pulp Fiction'. And the narrative: the different story lines that come together, the elegantly used flashbacks, the use of ""chapters"" – there is so much playful creativity at play here, it's just a pure joy to watch.If you're a bit of a film geek, you realize how much knowledge about film and love for the work of other greats – and inspiration from them - went into this (Leone, DePalma, Scorsese and, of course, dozens of hyper-stylized Asian gangster flicks), but to those accusing Tarantino of copying or even ""stealing"" from other film-makers I can only say: There has never been an artist who adored his kind of art that was NOT inspired or influenced by his favorite artists. And if you watch Tarantino's masterpiece today, it's impossible not to recognize just what a breath of fresh air it was (still is, actually). Somehow, movies - especially gangster films - never looked quite the same after 'Pulp Fiction'. Probably the most influential film of the last 20 years, it's got simply everything: amazing performances (especially Sam Jackson); it features some of the most sizzling, iconic dialogue ever written; it has arguably one of the best non-original soundtracks ever - it's such a crazy, cool, inspirational ride that you feel dizzy after watching it for the first time. It's – well: it's 'Pulp Fiction'. 10 stars out of 10.Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/"
Pulp Fiction,09-Jan-05,"To put this in context, I am 34 years old and I have to say that this is the best film I have seen without doubt and I don't expect it will be beaten as far as I am concerned. Obviously times move on, and I acknowledge that due to its violence and one particularly uncomfortable scene this film is not for everyone, but I still remember watching it for the first time, and it blew me away. Anyone who watches it now has to remember that it actually changed the history of cinema. In context- it followed a decade or more of action films that always ended with a chase sequence where the hero saved the day - you could have written those films yourself. Pulp had you gripped and credited the audience with intelligence. There is not a line of wasted dialogue and the movie incorporates a number of complexities that are not immediately obvious. It also resurrected the career of Grease icon John Travolta and highlighted the acting talent of Samuel L Jackson. There are many films now that are edited out of sequence and have multiple plots etc but this is the one they all want to be, or all want to beat, but never will."
Pulp Fiction,30-Dec-98,"If you think ""Pulp Fiction"" is brilliant, you're wrong. It's more than that. It's a milestone in the history of film making. It's already a classic. But why? Because of the many ""f"" words, or maybe because of the brain and skull pieces on the rear window of a car? No, that's surely not the point (unfortunately some other users - fortunately the minority - don't get it). Tarantino has made a movie that's someway different from many other action, gangster or crime movies. What's so different? He knows the subject of the movie is ""cool"", he knows it's a product of mass culture, and he even likes it by himself. But he smiles at it and tells three great stories with a lot of irony. And this irony is the first point. The second point is that he gave souls to extremely schematic characters. They surely aren't another action heroes who you forget as fast as you can twinkle. They are human beings like we are, talking about Burger King and McDonalds, about TV series and a foot massage. They just earn their money with killing others or selling drugs. What else is so great about ""Pulp Fiction""? It's the acting, the directing, the cinematography, the soundtrack, the sense of humour and the whole rest. In my opinion it's all worth nothing less than a 10 out of 10. A masterpiece."
Pulp Fiction,08-Dec-04,"Viewers are taken on a ride through three different stories that entertwine together around the world of Marcellus Wallace. Quentin Tarantino proves that he is the master of witty dialogue and a fast plot that doesn't allow the viewer a moment of boredom or rest. From the story of two hit-man on a job, to a fixed boxing match to a date between a hit-man and the wife of a mob boss. There was definitely a lot of care into the writing of the script, as everything no matter the order it is in, fits with the story. Many mysteries have been left such as what is inside of the briefcase and why Marcellus Wallace has a band-aid on the back of his neck, which may be connected. The movie redefined the action genre and reinvigorated the careers of both John Travolta and Bruce Willis. This movie is required viewing for any fan of film."
Pulp Fiction,11-Feb-20,"A groundbreaking movie from QT that intertwines several stories,a couple of BONNIE and CLYDE type criminals kick of this ROLLER COASTER ride with a spontaneous madcap robbery,a couple of gangsters go to retrieve a suitcase for their boss with dire consequence and an ageing boxer has an early retirement bout arranged in his favor,each story unfolds in ultra violent fashion with characters crossing paths through a criminal and corrupt network,dialogue between each unique individual is world class as the balance between humor and terror is achieved beautifully.an all star cast featuring some of QTs favorites put in memorable performances here and JOHN TRAVOLTA reinvents himself and plays VINCENT flawlessly.written and directed by QT this is one of the best crime movies ever made and caps off a crime trilogy from QT in only the space of 3 years - RESERVOIR DOGS 1992 - TRUE ROMANCE 1993 and now PULP FICTION 1994 - truly amazing.........."
Pulp Fiction,19-Jan-05,"Pulp Fiction may be the single best film ever made, and quite appropriately it is by one of the most creative directors of all time, Quentin Tarantino. This movie is amazing from the beginning definition of pulp to the end credits and boasts one of the best casts ever assembled with the likes of Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth and Christopher Walken. The dialog is surprisingly humorous for this type of film, and I think that's what has made it so successful. Wrongfully denied the many Oscars it was nominated for, Pulp Fiction is by far the best film of the 90s and no Tarantino film has surpassed the quality of this movie (although Kill Bill came close). As far as I'm concerned this is the top film of all-time and definitely deserves a watch if you haven't seen it."
Pulp Fiction,25-Jun-00,"My oh my.  ""Pulp Fiction"" is one of those roller-coasters of a movie.  It is both a joy and a trial to sit through.  Amazingly original and unforgettable, Quentin Tarantino's trash masterpiece never gets old or seem outdated.  It put a face on American independent film making in 1994. Miramax had been around since the 1970s and no one had heard of it before this film.  Studios went into a panic when this film came out because they knew it would be an amazing hit.  Of course it was.  Independent film making became the rage and hit its peak in 1996 when four of the five nominated Best Picture films were from independent studios.  The screenplay and direction by Tarantino are quite amazing, but the cast makes the film work. John Travolta (Oscar nominated) re-invented his career with this film. Bruce Willis cemented his celebrity.  Samuel L. Jackson and Uma Thurman (both Oscar nominees) became marketable superstars.  Others who make appearances include: Ving Rhames, Christopher Walken, Eric Stoltz, Rosanna Arquette, Steve Buscemi, Frank Whaley, Harvey Keitel, and of course Quentin Tarantino himself.  They all leave lasting impressions as well.  Samuel L. Jackson stood out the most to me, his lack of substantial screen time may have cost him the Oscar.  Just an amazing accomplishment, all involved deserve recognition.  Easily 5 stars out of 5."
Pulp Fiction,17-Jul-20,"Great movie tarantinos best ,
watch IT if you don't you have missed out, so watch IT and enjoy!!!"
Pulp Fiction,01-Jan-20,"This if you have not already.It is violent, action-packed and sexy.Watch it again if you have already. It is just too much fun to watch once."
Pulp Fiction,04-Apr-00,"Tarantino is without a doubt one of the best directors of all time and maybe the best of the 90's. His first film, Reservoir Dogs was amazing and claustrophobic, his segment in Four Rooms was by far the greatest (even though Rodriguez's was excellent too)and Jackie Brown is a wonderful homage to the Blaxploitation films of the 70's. However, Pulp Fiction remains my favourite.It was nominated for so many Oscars that I still find it hard to believe that it only got one: Best original script. I'm not complaining because Forrest Gump got best picture, since that film was also Oscar-worthy, but come on, movies like Tarantino's or the Shawshank Redemption deserved much more.Anyway, going back to the movie, I particularly liked the first and second chapters, and that's really a contradiction because one of the movie's finest characters, Mr. Wolf, appears on the third. Bruce Willis also does a great job, and as far as I'm concerned he fell in love with the movie right after having read the script. I like the way his character gives a ""tough guy"" image at the beginning and then we discover he's so affectionate and tender to his wife. Travolta is obviously the star of the movie and his second encounter with Bruce Willis in the kitchen along with the scene where he dances with Uma Thurman is when the movie reaches it's highest point.The other star is Samuel L. Jackson, who plays a wise assassin that obviously knows how to handle situations. ""And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger..."" is my favourite quote.Summarizing, Pulp Fiction is a modern classic and a must-see for anyone who is at least aware of what a movie is. I give it a 9 out of 10."
Pulp Fiction,17-Apr-20,"This is my favorite film of all time. Every second of this film is engaging, and I'm not exaggerating when I say that. Tarantino's direction and script is brilliant, and every role is perfectly cast. Everything that happens in this movie has a purpose, and you don't realize it's hidden in plain sight until the final moments"
Pulp Fiction,10-Apr-20,"Possibly the most influential movie made in history since the first movie ever made .Even after 25 years and a countless number of copy cats this movie absolutely holds up and feels fresh.
As many of you would know this movie is sort of like a tribute to the pulp stories written back in the 40s and 50s which have punchy and witty dialogue and over the top violence. The random chit chat between characters regarding obscure things might feel a waste of time as it doesn't move the plot. But Tarantino is a genius and he believes in character development more than plot development so these chats actually humanizes the characters a lot and makes them relatable and memorable(The absolute converse of Nolan). This movie is just a collection of wonderful scenes back to back from start to finish.. The movie is a must watch just for the awesome screenplay alone. To top it off all the actors arguably give their career best performance(think about it ,it is true) . And the ability of Tarantino to just create a really tense or ridiculous situation out of nowhere(like the psycho tribute scene with marsellus and butch which is so unexpected or that adrenaline shot scene) is just awesome and keeps you on the edge of your seats .So if you want an entertaining but clever movie this is the one you are looking for . It is funny, filled with some of the best dialogues ever ,superbly acted, great soundtracks(I just wanna see Tarantino's ipod , boy does he have great taste) and is just a spectacular experience.Spoilers ahead(duh):
For those of you who say the characters are hollow I suggest you to revisit the gold watch sequence. Walken's Capt Koons tells a story to young butch about how Butch's grandpa requested an enemy soldier to return his watch to his family and the soldier agreed. Similarly Butch could have left Marsellus but the legacy of his watch made him save him which I believe was a nice touch. And how Jules(one of my characters of all time) undergoes a change is also a noteworthy counter argument to the above mentioned criticism.Sorry for the huge review.."
Pulp Fiction,20-Jan-00,"Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction is a terrific film. It also gets better with each viewing, especially if one of those happens to be on a big theatrical screen where all of the BIG compositions get bigger and more detailed. How much else is there to talk about it after all these years? It's filled with dynamite, sudden and always interesting action, great and naturally clever dialogue, and memorable characters. Also, the acting is always something to behold as by turns straightforward, over the top, subtle, and just downright menacing and spot-on. The directing is one of the strongest that we've seen from Tarantino, as he makes his choices in pacing with shots in unconventional ways but never in a way that would be distracting. And writing, already noted, has been copied by many, and only equaled by a select few. The dance sequence. Samuel L. Jackson's superlative monologuing. It has loyalty among low lifes, and many other odd characters that are all bad and not one is a villain or hero. And somehow even after years of parody and terrible rip-offs, it holds its own and- as one can say after seeing it at a midnight screening- holds its audience as much as it had the countless times before they saw it (or if they are, the first time). The first time you're surprised, the second time you look for the clues or other ambiguity, and then the third time you laugh you head off. The fourth time... I'll leave to you."
Pulp Fiction,18-Apr-04,"I just finished screening this movie for the first time after putting it off for a number of years because of what seemed like equivocating appraisals from some of my friends. In hindsight, however, it seems to me that while the movie must have definitely bowled them over, overall they weren't sure exactly what to make of it or how to articulate what were probably a confused mix of feelings. But I am so impressed that I feel compelled to add a few specific observations to the many fine reviews already on this database.First, this movie hits you with an impact somewhere in between, say, APOCALYPSE NOW and A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, and for some people may be just as disturbing (however, in this respect I am happy to report I didn't think it rose to the level of NATURAL BORN KILLERS). Full of graphically violent action and language, PULP FICTION is not a picture for everyone - I would definitely not recommend it to my parents, born in the 1930's (even to my one fairly ""hip"" relative of the same generation who, at age 66, still teaches high school sex education and likes to talk about things like sunbathing nude, among other potentially sensitive issues).Irrespective of audience sensibilities, however, the film-makers, supported by superb acting in every role, manage to create a world full of the most fascinating sleazy characters possibly ever to appear on screen. From Travolta's pronounced almost-child-like curiosity about the world to Jackson's sincere and thoughtful philosophical ruminating and Willis's deep devotion to the memory of his father, I think such fascination lies not only in the characters' personalities as they are portrayed but in the way they tantalize the viewer into considering the possibility that such people could actually exist. As a lawyer of some years' experience dealing with all sorts of people I was particularly drawn to this aspect of the film.Thus, and in response to some other reviewers' comments, I think this movie is more character-driven than plot-driven. Instead of a story peopled by basically weakly developed characters employed primarily as a mere device to move the plot along, as is too frequently the case in the movies (especially these days), the undeniably strong, clever, and unpredictable plot lines in PULP FICTION are actually of essentially secondary interest and importance, serving primarily as vehicles to get you worried about the fate of characters you can't help caring about despite the truly low attributes that otherwise form the basis for their respective personas. As at least one other reviewer noted, when the film ends you are actually disappointed, left craving more of these crazy people and their explosive lives.Finally, and as strange as it may sound, this film reminds me of another Monumentally Great Film which one would never typically associate with it in any way in a million years - CASABLANCA. As in that film made way back in 1942, and as another reviewer has suggested, perhaps its special appeal - its unusually high degree of emotional impact - lies in its distinctly successful simultaneous application of several different genres in a single film - drama, action, dark humor - with the whole thing bound together by essentially flawless execution in every department. And while CASABLANCA is no doubt clearly much more wholesome and high-minded, like the older film PULP FICTION is not without a pronounced theme of redemption, even if it is not as strongly felt, considering all the later film's sleaze and violence.In sum, when people say that this is probably the best film of the 1990's, it is easy to see why. Fundamentally a truly outstanding movie, it is a must-see for anyone who considers themself a film buff and can handle graphic subject matter.(Incidentally, if you would like a more toned-down, much more overtly humorous and less serious picture with a not-altogether dissimilar look and feel, don't miss another 1990's Travolta picture, GET SHORTY.)"
Pulp Fiction,02-Aug-98,"Pulp Fiction, despite borrowing from just about every movie ever made, is the most invigorating cinema experience a filmgoer can ever hope for. Its hodgepodge of violence, mayhem, and generally deviant behavior is an assault on the senses, not to mention political correctness. However, despite all the film's cleverness and style, it hinges on the performance put forth by Samuel L. Jackson as Jules. The fact that he was denied an Oscar is a downright shame. Martin Landau, the best supporting actor winner that year, was terrific and funny in Ed Wood, but Jackson was perhaps the most commanding screen presence in film history as the bible-quoting, godfearing hitman. The last scene in the coffee shop with Tim Roth still sends chills down my spine, no matter how many times I've seen it. Rumors of a prequel involving Jules and Vincent (John Travolta) have been floating around lately. If Quentin Tarantino wishes to regain the fans he lost with the dissapointing (but still pretty good) Jackie Brown, he should get to work right away. I'll be the first in line to see the finished product."
Pulp Fiction,18-May-08,"A masterpiece? Do me a favour! Perhaps it's because of the hype that surrounds this film, but I was really disappointed with what I saw.Two and a half hours was too long in my view, and nothing particularly out of the ordinary happens.I didn't find it clever, nor were the ""unforgettable"" scenes like the dance between Travolta and Thurman or Samuel L Jackson's speech unforgettable.Maybe because cinema has advanced so much since 1994 that I would have had to watch it then to appreciate it, but I only recently saw Hitchcock's Rear Window for the first time and enjoyed that immensely.People go on as if this film has the best storyline and gangster scenes ever but quite frankly, it doesn't.Moreover, I found Natural Born Killers more affective for it's style than Pulp Fiction.It does have some good scenes, and I was rooting for Bruce Willis' character throughout, but I saw nothing that makes this film outstanding or worthy of being so high in IMDb's rankings."
Pulp Fiction,02-Nov-14,"I was tempted to stop watching it about four times. I went up to the end just to see if, at least, there is something extraordinary or unexpected there. I really can't understand what all these viewers found to this film, to score it so high. It's the first time (or the second I'm not sure!) that I get into the mood of writing a review. The reason, I guess, is because this film is the fifth in the top 250 ranking and I couldn't see why. The curiosity of the ranking was also the reason of watching it at the first place. There is a high end casting and a top level director but nothing more, IN MY OPINION. I tried looking it through the eyes of 1994 but still compared to other productions of the age is far behind. If you find yourself in the position wondering whether to watch this film or not, due to its place in the list don't waste your time!"
Pulp Fiction,15-Jul-20,"Pulp fiction is one of the most revolutionary films in the industry. It is funny, chaotic and entertaining. The film itself never tried to play it cool. And that is what makes it so captivating; its unwillingness to look cool and deep(like every Tarantino film) charms every viewer. Pulp fiction compaired to every other film of the industry probably looks like that one girl in the club that you will never see again but you will likely keep fantasizing of forever;She is totally indifferent and bored, effortlessly cool and gives the best laughs. Wait... Mia Wallace, is that you???"
Pulp Fiction,13-Jul-20,I've heard about this film for years. I always pushed it away because I thought old films weren't really my thing. They were always so raw but too long for me. But pulp fiction has to be one of the best films. I have never seen such a comedic and raw movie that would keep me at the edge of my seat. The fact that the first scene fitted so well with the last scene is amazing.
Pulp Fiction,17-Aug-06,"The proof of the pudding, they say, is in the eating. The proof of the movie is in the watching. Most of the top 250 IMDb movies have kept me glued to my seat--with this one I found my mind wandering to that jigsaw puzzle I hadn't finished or the possibility of some popcorn. I found I had very little interest in the characters or in what was going on.I asked myself why. Technically the film is very good. The actors all hit their marks and Samuel L. Jackson is particularly outstanding. I liked Maria de Madeiros also as Bruce Willis' wife Fabienne. The camera work is occasionally interesting, as the long scene where we watch Bruce Willis listen unemotionally to Marsellus go on. Interesting, certainly, but rather pointless.Indeed, that's the problem: so much of what goes on is pointless. It's a big long shaggy dog story, told by one of those irritating people who can't get the story straight and have to keep going back: ""Oh yeah, I forgot to tell you about that. Well, you know what I was telling you before . . ."" I tried to find some justification for the higgledy-piggledy way in which this story is told. It does result in the best scene being the last one. But if this scene was the point then why not design the script so that the action is seen to be moving toward this goal and cut out everything that happens afterward? In the end I don't think Tarentino knew what story he was telling and that's why so much is so pointless.The scenes of Butch attempting to control his temper, of his dilemma whether to help Marsellus, and the final scene in the restaurant are all good and entertaining as far as they go but they don't fall into a coherent framework. And the rest is quite dull.The dialogue is not witty or clever although it occasionally has its moments. The constant profanity is as pointless as the rest; the point of profanity is presumably to emphasize what one is saying, but if everything is emphasized, nothing is. The mind becomes numbed by it. It's like someone who shouts all the time. Eventually you stop listening. The quotes give you a pretty good idea of what the dialogue is like: when ""Shut the f*ck up, fat man!"" is listed as a memorable quote, you know how inane the conversation is.That this poorly composed script should have won an Oscar is a pretty clear indictment of the Academy."
Pulp Fiction,18-Jan-99,"I think one of the problems many people have with this movie is that it defined and set into motion an extremely irritating trend in contemporary film. The god-awful clones of Tarantino pouring out of indie and mainstream studios alike should not, however, detract from the brilliance and subtlety of this movie. It works simply because those moments of brilliance (I have to admit I know the whole ""Jules redemption-speech"" by heart) that its imitators lack come in the midst of the camp and gore they all do so well. Tarantino alone uses an adolescent obsession with shallowness and morbidity to high satirical effect--like all great films (or even novels), this movie sets itself into a two-dimensional genre (absurd, pop-culture, comic-book situations) and then undermines its own genre by exposing the heart and soul underneath. There are too many points in the movie in which this happens to mention, but a few come to mind: the blown kiss from Vincent to Mia at the end of the first (or maybe second) story; the death of Vincent; the obvious emotional dedication of Butch to his wife at the end of his own story; Vincent's unwillingness to believe in his own supernatural salvation without realizing he's doomed; and, of course, the climactic speech. With the exception of Jules's final words, many of these moments seem at first to be horrifying or funny--but this is only because they fit so well into the flow of the script. A second glance shows them to be moments so poignant that the only reason they work is because they are so unique to the characters and their situations. The changes in each (or the lack of change) come, in a sense, as they individually choose to either drive for them or fall behind. Most die-hard fans of the movie, I'm sure, have heard the story of the briefcase and the band-aids on the back of Wallace's neck (the entire movie being a quest to bring back his stolen soul), and although Tarantino has denied it, he can't deny that the movie is full of such heroic themes: escape by trial, the reclamation of past, love as both physical salvation and personal security, a will to believe in something beyond one's own selfish world. I won't say that if you don't like this movie that you're mistaken or ignorant, but I think that Tarantino puts his audience into settings much like his characters are in: cheap, full of profanity and nastiness, fleeting. The best of them break through; I think he asks that anyone watching do the same."
Pulp Fiction,25-Jan-19,Pulp Fiction is one of those movies that not everyone can enjoy. Many people say that it's boring and senseless. It is true that the plot isn't something special but it isn't the plot that makes this movie so unique but the awesome script and great cinematography.Probably one of the greatest things in this movie are the dialogues. The dialogues just like in all other Tarantino movies aren't directly connected with the plot. Take the first dialogue between Samuel Jackson and John Travolta. They are talking about how a certain burger is called in France. This and many others dialogues don't have a direct relation with the plot line but their function is to somehow build the characters' personalities.The other thing that makes this movie so unique is the unexpected turn of events. Like in all other Tarantino movies you don't know who they are going to kill next or what is going to happen. The scene where Vincent shoots Marvin in the face is a great example for such unexpected turn of events. This makes the viewer more intrigued and thus makes the whole experience form the movie way better.There isn't much more that can be said about Pulp Fiction. It's not a movie that everyone will enjoy but still deserves to be seen.
Pulp Fiction,13-Feb-12,"It kind of feels redundant trying to write a review for Pulp Fiction as it approaches its 20th birthday. As a film it needs no introduction, it won the Palme d'Or at Cannes, won a BAFTA and Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay (Tarantino), and garnered a whole host of other awards and nominations. Box office beef was meaty and its reputation even now shows no sign of waning (it currently sits at number 4 on the IMDb top 100 list), it is by definition one cool MOFO of a movie, a picture loved by a cross section of demographics. But why?Pulp Fiction oozes humour, romance, violence and stylish flourishes. It remains compulsive viewing throughout; even as it threatens to get submerged in its own complex structure. Film lover Tarantino takes a number of low life and unfortunate characters from Los Angeles, mainlines then with movie clichés, and then amazingly breathes new life into them. It knowingly winks at B movies from the past yet always remains fresh on its own terms. I myself having just revisited the film after a 5 year gap can attest to just how well it holds up, laughing at the dialogue, perched on the edge of the seat as violence starts to rumble, and yes, singing along with that most catchy of soundtracks.Yet for all its flashiness and hipster chattering, there's one thing that often gets overlooked when talk of Pulp Fiction's greatness arises. That of a basic human urge to survive or find salvation, Tarantino's main characters may be bottom feeders or scummy operatives of the underworld, but there's love and needing beating slowly in its dark heart before the drugs and violence take a hold. Neat trick that from Tarantino, brilliant in fact. 10/10"
Pulp Fiction,28-Aug-09,"This is for all the guys who voted to make this movie a masterpiece. I don't know on what everyone depended in evaluating this movie. Everyone agrees that the cast includes some of the best actors out there, but a good cast doesn't mean that the movie is a masterpiece. This movie was without a subject, no message, too much repeated sentences, nothing connected with each other. You will get tired of listening to duologue's about ""foot massage"", ""hamburgers"", ""Butch's fathers watch"" .etc, these things cover more than a half of the movies length without meaning anything to the movie.I was very disappointed when I saw this movie. This movie is way overrated and should be among ""IMBD 100 Bottom"". If you want to waste two and a half hours listening only to duologue's without a subject then this is the movie and if you really want to know how a masterpiece looks like then you should watch The Shawshank Redemption."
Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey,06-Feb-20,"While Margot Robbie is a good Harley Quinn, the character was not given enough arc. The plot was predictable and mainstream, especially due to lack of a strong antagonist. The main antagonist, played by Ewan McGregor, was not developed and hence did not add significant value to the plot story. Although some of the fight scenes were entertaining, the film as a whole was truly forgettable."
Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey,10-Feb-20,"Margot Robbie is pretty awesome as Harley Quinn however even with that, this movie is one step up from unwatchable. The plot is all over the place, the dialogue is horrible, the characters other than Harley Quinn are inconsequential, and basically the producers are just spitting in the eye of anybody who has been a fan of the comics. There were a couple good laughs and a couple good fight scenes but otherwise this really was nothing but a loud, garish Suicide Squad spin-off. I'd be all for a real DC Birds of Prey movie, but this film should not even have had that name in the title."
Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey,11-Feb-20,"First Hit: This movie was absolutely horrible and a waste of time and money.The original title of this film is ""Birds of Prey: And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn."" The title alone is a warning enough, and when you read it, it is all you'll need to know about this story. I do not know what the screenwriter or director was thinking, but it wasn't about making a movie that had conscious cognizant coherence.From the get-go, this film is a mess. Using narrative and disjointed clips of film, to attempt to put the story in place and time was useless here because there really is no place or time.I thought ""Suicide Squad"" was a quirky fun movie and where we meet Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) for the first time. She was odd, ""out there,"" and on the edge of crazy. This film Birds of Prey is supposed to give us the backstory of Ms. Quinn. It is also a way to introduce other characters, the ""Birds of Prey,"" consisting of Renee Montoya (Rosie Perez), ""The Huntress,"" aka Helena Bertinelli (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), and ""Black Canary,"" aka Dinah Lance (Jurnee Smollett-Bell).There's little character development, so they use some narration and snippets of past stories to fill in the backstory of these characters.This group of women come together because of and over the improbability of a young pickpocketing girl, Cassandra Cain (Ella Jay Basco), swallowing a large, I mean colossally large diamond stolen from a thieving, conniving, and self-named lord of Gotham, Roman Sionis (Ewan McGregor).Lots of fighting ensues, and we always know who wins. The fighting scenes are not well-choreographed and felt staged. The logic stream of the story was virtually non-existent while it seemed as though the director Cathy Yan threw together a bunch of clips of film scraps she shot with this cast doing stuff and called it a day.Robbie is an excellent actress. She' has proven her abilities in many films. Therefore, I'm surprised she co-produced and acted in this hot mess. Despite her talents, this was not good work. Perez, who has been missed in recent years, did what she could with this limiting role. Winstead was the best of the lot. Her quiet demeanor and her story of how she came up with ""The Huntress"" was amusing when everyone else liked calling her ""Crossbow."" Smollett-Bell tried to make her character mean something but, again, the script and direction let her down. McGregor was okay as the foil for the Birds of Prey. Christina Hodson created a disjointed and lackluster screenplay with little substance. Yan has no business directing a film with this film as proof.Overall: This movie was a total waste of time."
Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey,08-Feb-20,Target demographic (12-17 year old girls)Movies rating (R18+)Whoever thought this was a good idea definitely needs to reconsider. Your own audience couldn't see it.It's easily the worst of the 8 DC films to date. You want female empowerment watch Wonder Woman.
Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey,10-Jul-20,"To simply put it without wasting anybody's time unlike my time was wasted watching this garbage, Birds of Prey And ....etc is a chance completely wasted! should've been, Harley Quinn (add any lame title here), There's No Notable presence of Birds of Prey here. The film is How Harley Quinn stood against a gay version of Black Mask.The plot story and the directing is a true to heart chick flick and clearly influenced by the feminist movement. The script emphasizing blindly on discriminating against men by representing all male characters in either gay, bisexual portrait or an evil and traitorous manner! The female on the other hand are represented is sadly based on race not on the relation to the comics character nor the fans desire, which is clearly a method of trying to tastelessly involve everyone that no race feels left out! I.e., the choosing of an Asian Cassandra Cain over Barbra Gordon.The disaster starts from the casting process, I'll never stop believing that Margot Robbie is a very bad depiction of Harley Quinn, From the looks which is feels way off, as Margot has a long face while Harley has a round face to the fact that she does not feel or sound the same, least to say how different Arleen Sorkin says Mr. J or Puddin' with a nerdy yet playful way and how Margot fails to represent that. Not to mention the ridiculous child size mallet they gave her in this movie. I believe the main reason why many fans drool over Margot in the first place is mainly because they didn't see anyone else play the role on a big screen yet not because Margot is a good actress or can represent Harley well. The scenes decorations feels like it was designed by a crazed extravagant fashion designer and the fighting scenes along with the directing is obviously all over the place in a disastrous manner.My suggestion is don't waste your time or money on this garbage until the suits learn how to make a proper Harley movie."
Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey,08-Mar-20,"Well i highly suggest that you do not smoke before starting that movie.
I did and i was trapped on my couch without the will to move my arm to reach the remote control. So i was literally forced to watch the whole movie! If i ever will be a bad person and that for go to hell this exact situation but for all eternity will be my punishment. I started praying daily to prevent this horrible fate."
Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey,11-Feb-20,"Saw this movie with no expectations and open minded, And oh my word what a complete disaster! This movie was a pain to watch, boring, nothing happening, stupid dialogue and a script that's just not interesting at all! I honestly didn't think that a movie that was so hyped could get so ruined in so many ways, some elements were kinda cool but not enough to clean up the mess the rest of the movie served.Without a doubt one of the worst movies i have ever watched (possibly the worst ever). A total waste of money in my opinion."
Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey,05-Feb-20,"A dud from Warner Bros. The best thing about suicide squad was Robbie's performance but this vehicle is a disservice to the potential that was there. Robbie does her best but the direction, script and editing are not at the requisite level. An interesting character poorly treated by a very lacklustre script. Disappointing."
Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey,09-Feb-20,"This could have been such a good movie! The movie took a few steps too many into the woke space. While some of the elements fit in well with the theme, it becomes tiring if the same message is constantly being repeated over and over and over. It simply spoils the movie"
Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey,11-Feb-20,"I haven't walked out of a film in 30 years, until tonight. About 45 minutes was all I could take. There literally wasn't a single scene that wasn't absolutely stupid in every way.I just there squirming, feeling so embarrassed for Margo. Please do not waste your money on this awful film."
Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey,22-Mar-20,"I actually like the actors, no hate here, but this movie is impossible to sit through. There is not one good thing about it. There is not one scene worth watching. At all. What functioning industry would produce something like this I cannot comprehend."
Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey,09-Feb-20,"Before we saw this movie, my son told me that there were lots of 1/10 reviews on IMDb from people who hadn't even seen the film. Well, here's a 1/10 review from someone who has.Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn reminds me a lot of Lori Petty in Tank Girl (1995), another comic book film that really ground my gears. Like Petty's character, every quirky mannerism and snarky comment by Harley got right on my tits, as did her horrible fashion sense. In addition to Robbie's diabolical performance, we get equally obnoxious turns from Rosie Perez as a tough cop, Ella Jay Basco as an annoying pick-pocket, and Ewan McGregor as camp crime boss Roman Sionis, plus an absolutely pointless tribute to Marilyn Monroe, lots of dumb, supposedly amusing captions, a tiresome self-aware voice-over, and a horrible CGI hyena.Director Cathy Yan (who?), working from a charmless script by Christina Hodson, is unable to do anything interesting with the admittedly wafer-thin plot, which can be boiled down to just a handful of words: ""everyone is looking for a diamond"".A muddled, noisy, gaudy mess, full of poorly constructed action scenes and goofy humour that falls flat on its face, Birds of Prey is possibly the worst film I have seen at the cinema in recent months. And I saw Cats and Bombshell (another Margot Robbie disaster)."
Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey,06-Feb-20,"Birds of Prey: and the Fantabulous Emancipation of one Harley Quinn, is a movie I had high hopes for but it fell flat. I will start off this review with the positive aspects first such as: Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn was a great casting and continues to be where I think she gives a better performance then her one in Suicide Squad, and Ewan Mcgregor plays a decent version of Black Mask. The use of colours and costumes I thought were great and I found some moments of entertainment through some of its action sequences.However, This film has a lot of problems, most of the performances in this film are very shoddy, especially from Rosie Perez who is a walking cliche' as Renee Montoya (and I know that's what they were going for but it just doesn't work}, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Huntress who gives us some very cringey at times acting, and I think some of this has something to do with the screenplay which I also think is average at best. The humour that they're going for doesn't work at all I chuckled maybe once, and it was the same for my theatre. They also butchered Victor Zsasz which I found extremely disappointing as I was looking forward to his inclusion in the DCEU, the way he was portrayed was nothing like how he is in the comics and it seems like he is just trying to be some knock off version of the Joker. Also why is the film titled Birds of Prey? This is a Harley Quinn Movie, just like the trailers the Birds of Prey are barely in it and when they were they had small glimpses of being cool characters but for the most part they were some of the most cliched early 2000's era superhero characters I have seen since that era.Overall, I found Birds of Prey to be a disappointment I came into this film very optimistic but got let down, due to the fact that this films writing was just plain bad. If Margot Robbie's and Ewan Mcgregor's performances weren't as great as what they were with the nice compliments of the characters costumes it would have been completely boring and cliched garbage."
Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey,27-Mar-20,"So many good actors and characters, how did this turn out so badly.
If it was free to watch, I would have turned it off.
Unfortunately, it's just bad."
Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey,09-Feb-20,I was one of the many fans of Margot Robbie who was wowed by her initial performance as Harley Quinn and looked with anticipation for the character's return. I never imagined the pathetic sequel that has been released. EVERYTHING IS TERRIBLE! The Director and the Scriptwriter who created this stink bomb should be banished from Hollywood and Margot should have held out for a better script instead of accepting her payday. Very disappointing.
Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey,09-Feb-20,"The acting was good, most of the actors gave it their all, but the film was just so UGLY. Gave me a headache just looking at it. Also the dialogue was so cringe worthy. It wanted to sound and look edgy, but ended up being a complete mess of a film. Feel sorry for a character with such a strong fan base."
Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey,06-Feb-20,It's trying to be a Deadpool movie but it failed Miserably. There are some good action sequences but overall they are nothing like the Birds of Prey. For being a comic book movie it definitely fails. It's a messy movie overall.
Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey,06-Feb-20,"Suggestion, when doing a comic book film using beloved characters make sure to land those characters. You can deconstruct them all you like, but if the heart isn't there you get this instead of ""the joker"".There is no Birds of prey, at least none recognizable from their source material counterparts. Robbie is not Harley, her 90's trashy grunge gender studies cousin maybe, but not Harley. When a cartoon does better than a multi-million dollar film, you've failed.Over the top man hating new wave feminism and alphabet ""representation"" for no reason. Action is not believable. Writing is atrocious. Editing is frenetic.If you hated Suicide squad, welcome to its jealous over achieving sister."
Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey,08-Feb-20,What an absolute waste of money w the stupidest script. Of all the talented writers that must be out there - why would you choose to produce an obviously idiotic story like this ?? I just don't get it. You have this chance of putting something out there of value - all this sweet Hollywood money and this is the best you can come up with ?? Really ??
Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey,10-Feb-20,"With badly driven character arcs and nonexistent plot, ""Birds of Prey"" is a directionless mess. Instead of showing you a fun and interesting story, they would rather talk you through expository dialogue and narration. Beneath this pile of wasted potential is a sadly missed opportunity for an interesting story about some of DC's most interesting characters. The most compelling part of the movie for me was Hunteress, who had less screen time than an adolescent pick-pocket. But the best part of the film isn't even about the film, but the critics response. Even the top critics, whose job it is to judge movies by their story and characters, say that the fighting was so cool that it makes it a good movie. So then, why isn't Green Lantern considered a good movie? Man of Steel? Suicide Squad? These ""critics"" are either to dumb to realize an awful movie when they see one, or they're afraid to criticize movies because of the backlash they might get.In conclusion: Don't make the same mistake I did and waste your hard earned money on this two hour long mood swing."
Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey,09-Feb-20,Some of the action scenes were okay. Nothing special I was really hoping to see something worth watching. This is quite a disappointment. A lot of hype as usual What can I say? I'm just hoping when Venom comes out. I'll have something to enjoy. I don't recommend of this one.
Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey,07-Feb-20,"I'll just go straight for it, if you're going to downvote this review for defending a genuinely entertaining violent film, i get that. Literally just WATCH THE MOVIE! This movie is anything but a ""men are trash"" movie. It's a fun flick about a heist where it's all knives at eachothers throats. Genuinely formulaic at times, sure, but that's practically a given for these types of films! Margot Robbie gave a fantastic performance as the Quinn herself, and the side characters had their moments as well! Gotta give a FAT shoutout to McGregor for his role. He brought just as much flame and fire as Margot gave her role. Go ahead and do yourself a favor. This is a good ass time to watch!"
Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey,13-Feb-20,"I had only the vaguest idea about what to expect going into this movie and maybe that's why I was able to relax and enjoy it. Because, if you do that, you're just liable to find it highly entertaining. The actors did a good job of giving the characters personalities and clear motives. There was a good amount of humor without going off the deep end into silliness. The great soundtrack added to the energy of the movie without overwhelming scenes. This is a thoroughly enjoyable movie."
Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey,16-Feb-20,"I did not think the movie was worth the time it took to watch it. Harley, the main character, never shows any change from being a selfish despicable person. The only two ""good"" characters take a back seat and hardly show up until the end insted of getting sufficient screen time to make them memorable, and the way its written makes it as hard to follow as the story your 5 year old is trying to tell you. Overall, it had some scenes with good graphics but not enough to make up for the colossal waste this movie is."
Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey,12-Feb-20,"I've been a fan of Harley since BTAS & thought she was the only decent thing in Suicide Squad.Think the film shouldn't have really bothered with the Birds Of Prey theme, Just having the film focus around Harley would have worked just as well.Such a shame that it doesn't seem to have set the box office alight but hopefully the fact that is was filmed on a low budget which it will recouperate will lead to a 3rd one. Harley is DCs deadpool character & that's defo not a bad thing..."
Inglourious Basterds,10-Jul-12,"This review gives everything away, so see the movie first.It is neither allegory nor satire, the two finest categories in both fiction and cinema, and yet it approaches perfection anyway. It is of a nature I have no name for, but it is a nature that reveals truth and undermines falsehoods. Nothing is more cloaked in falsehood than the victor's depiction of past wars. It is especially true of the children of the victors--especially the children of US WWII veterans, like myself.We get our view of the war from movies like Audi Murphy in To Hell and Back or Saving Private Ryan. Nothing but praise for our heroes and cheers for killing the enemy. But QT exposes this hypocrisy by engineering a film where we are disgusted first by the excesses of the enemy and then by the excesses of our heroes. That is the first instance. The hypocrisy is slammed home in the second instance where we are first disgusted by the sight of American after American being shot dead by by a German sniper hero and secondly brought to revel in the butchery of several hundred enemy at the hands of our heroes. Tit for tat.It fits the pattern of praise for our heroes and cheers for killing the enemy, but because it is presented both ways the hypocrisy becomes self- evident. This is why so many people hate the movie--even if they fail to realize it. High art, true art, 10 of 10."
Inglourious Basterds,25-Aug-09,"That's what I thought, when I heard about the cast of Inglorious Basterds. And I'm both from Germany and into movies.That guy is older than 50 and so far he almost only played in mediocre TV series - and even there he didn't play the main parts. Obviously nobody ever noticed, what he's capable of. Now, thanks to QT, he got one shot to change that - and - let's put it this way - that was a bingo! He is the living proof of what a great caster Tarrantino is.By the way: I think it's a great privilege to watch the movie as a German - being able to understand everything. And the German dialog is written almost as good as the English.Now I could repeat, what many others have written here before. I'll put it short: Finally, QT is back."
Inglourious Basterds,23-Jul-09,"I had the PRIVILEGE of attending the UK premier of Inglorious Basterds this evening! Having seen the trailers i had high hopes but had doubts due to a string of self indulgent films (c'mon lets be honest, self indulgence is his tarantinos middle name)I was surprised to find though that he had pulled the cat out of the bag with this one. The film is rich with interesting dialogue, Perfect timed comedy with a dash of brutal assassination.The crowning glory of this film though lies with Christoph Waltz whom no fault or error can be found. He manages to create a real tension in the audience whilst remaining quite ""theatrical"" (couldn't think of a better word). He definitely deserved his prize at Cannes and is heading for an Oscar no doubt!!!! Hoping to see him in something again soon!"
Inglourious Basterds,24-Aug-09,"After watching Inglorious Basterds i was really surprised when i saw ratings on IMDb. Didn't expected high ratings and top 250 place. If we can only isolate and rate Christoph Waltz's acting performance i would agree that this movie deserves 10. But he is not alone, and his performance can't cover horrible plot, boring conversations, unfunny characters, alternative QT WW2 fantasy and Eli Roth as Jew bear. The opening scene with Denis Menochet as farmer and Christoph Waltz as SS officer is best part of the movie. Only part that have same quality and connects tension from that scene with the rest of the movie is a basement scene. Basement scene was crossroad for me. Michael Fassbender was great in role of British spy and his character adds some new layer of logic and realism in movie. In moments you can actually see some plot finally breaking through the rubbish you watched after the farm scene. After the basement chapter, movie is going nowhere. Empty space. A lot of empty space for movie that last 153 minutes. Long and boring scenes with boring characters and conversations. Childish fantasy mixed up with Spaghetti western movies and some atmosphere that don't belong to WW2 period. Thats why we have basterds to fill everything else and patch the rest of movie. They failed. Basterds are weakest/undeveloped and most boring part of movie. Movie is named by them, yes - Brad is on Movie poster ... but they are horrible. Worst role of Mr Pitt and i hope last one from Eli Roth. Cinema/Shosanna story with David Bowie music was just another QT patch v1.1 to fill huge empty space between farm and basement. Extremely boring scenes with Mélanie Laurent (taking off cinema letters, red dresses, secret love Marcel...) will blast your brain. Yes - headache is a must. Beside 2 good scenes, i really enjoyed listening smooth gradient of German, French and English language. But again, this is connected to Waltz and Fassbender and their personal knowledge that Tarantino used for his fantasy. Inglorious Basterds is Hybrid movie where gangsters are replaced with Nazis adding them wild west background layer with Brad Pitt on movie poster just to sell tickets. It doesn't work in this case.5/10 - only for Christoph Waltz and Michael Fassbender."
Inglourious Basterds,07-Oct-09,"An fun, engrossing, beautifully crafted piece of nonsense, the likes of which we hadn't seen in a long long time. The silliness of the story is marvelously camouflaged with great dialogue and some superb performances. Christoph Waltz must be thinking already about his acceptance speech. What a performance! The civilized monster, polyglot, refined and deadly. He gets us going from the first, sensational scene. Brad Pitt is also wonderful. Was he putting a Mussolinni chin while impersonating (hilariously) an Italian? I thought so. His character's name sounds like Aldo Ray and I'm sure that's no accident. The film is full of movie references. Another character is named Fenek, as an homage to his 1970's sexpot, Edwige Fenech. What is already one of Tarantino's trademarks is his sure step along the most immediately recognizable bits of pop culture. He's clearly not a cultured man but a pop expert, king in a world where people get their news from TV, don't read, other than magazines and comics, etc. That's how it happens, to be in the right place at the right time. For better or worse this are Tarantino times."
Inglourious Basterds,22-Sep-09,"I will just start with some quotes from other reviewers that describes it the best.""This is easily one of the most overrated films of the year and probably the worst film Tarantino has ever done."" ""The ONLY good thing in this movie was the performance of Mr. Waltz"".""So I was really disappointed, and seeing this movie on place #40 of the greatest movies of all time is the only thing about this, that leaves me with my mouth opened"" Now for more details go and read ""Hated it"" reviews.One thing I hate about a movie is when it treats audience as bunch of dumb people. (Spoiler ahead). Now I know Tarantino's style is based on fantasy and fictitious plots, but come on, Adolf Hitler and 200 top Nazis Officers will be in attendance of a movie premier in occupied France and you have only two guards in the whole theater and the surroundings? Where also an American-African walks around freely with steel pipes locking doors and setting fire. These 2 guards are then executed in seconds opening the door for our 2 ""heroes"" to slay Hitler at point blank with around 100 rounds... very dumb. At least, challenge our intelligence and create a smarter plot to kill one of the most feared tyrants of all time (Go watch Valkyrie). Besides, Mike Myers impersonation of a British general is more realistic and authentic than the guy doing Hitler, just picture that.What ruined it further, is that the only smart and powerful character, which nailed everyone in the movie, with his psychological and mind bending interrogations, ends up to be effortlessly tricked by the most mindless character in the movie.After watching the movie, I was sympathizing with Nazis, who were portrayed to have more bravery and humanity than our Basterds!!! Imagine that.My recommendations, if you have insomnia, 2hrs 33 min to waste or you want to give your mind a break, go watch this movie."
Inglourious Basterds,30-Jul-09,"Inglorious Basterds is a dark and violent comic fantasy, gloriously so. Built on the framework of The Dirty Dozen, Inglorious Basterds ditches the elongated training sequences of The Dirty Dozen to plunge into the action right away. In the process, Tarantino fixes one of The Dirty Dozen's major flaws by giving the bad guys screen time to remind us just how bad the Nazis were. The Nazis with the most screen time end up becoming the most completely human characters in the film, which ironically makes them even worse monsters.Bu ditching the training sequences, Tarantino is also able to give us a picture of the entire war, showing us not only British, American and German soldiers, but also giving us glimpses into the world of French and German civilians, both collaborators and Resistance.It goes without saying that any Tarantino film is going to have fantastic dialogue, but when Tarantino made the decision to have the French characters speak French and the Germans speak German, beyond adding a level of authenticity, Tarantino also somehow ensured that his dialogue in French was as sharp and funny and clever as his English dialogue.Case in point, during the opening sequence the Nazi ""Jew Hunter"" SS Colonel Hans Landa (Christian Waltz) is interrogating French dairy farmer Perrier LaPadite (Denis Menochet). Landa suspects that LaPadite is hiding a family of Jews. While subtly pressuring LaPadite, Landa asks for a glass of milk. After greedily gulping it down, Landa compliments LaPadite on his daughters and his cows, ""à votre famille et à vos vaches, je dis bravo."" The thing of it is, in French ""vache"" means cow, but it is also a vulgar name for the vagina. If reprimanded for this vulgar pun, Landa could quite convincingly claim not to understand French well enough to have meant it that way, but Landa does mean it that way and he means it as a threat. And LaPadite understands his meaning all too well.That is a really subtle piece of acting and word-play that many audiences would never catch, or at least they might understand the subtext without knowing the exact nature of the threat. The film is rich with that kind of detail. All of the French and English dialogue is chosen with that same attention to detail and while I can't swear to the German, I would suspect that it shows a similar level of craft.Inglorious Basterds opens with the phrase, ""Once Upon a Time... in Nazi-Occupied France."" Personally, this reminds me of the opening of every Asterix book and movie, another comic fantasy in a war-torn occupied France. Like Asterix, Inglorious Basterds is howlingly funny in places, although the film also turns darkly serious.In its more serious moments, Inglorious Basterds reminds us that the first casualties of war are compassion and the ability to relax, as in almost every elongated sequence of the film, Tarantino finds a new way to build cruel tension to almost unbearable levels.Tarantino also reminds us that film is dangerous, even inflammable and that its power deserves respect.If you can see this film as I did in a packed theatre filled with knowledgeable fans who get every joke, that you will see this masterful film the way that it was meant to be seen. If you are not that lucky, all that you will see is a great, great film that delivers a darkly funny punch."
Inglourious Basterds,05-Oct-09,"Once again, revenge is at the center of a Quentin Tarantino movie. This time a Jewish dirty dozen takes things on their own hands. Tarantino re-writes history and shortens WWII with a comic stroke that is as entertaining as it is vacuous. A fantasy that re-arranges some controversial historical points. Okay, it's a movie and as such it works for most of its two and a half hours. Christoph Waltz opens things up in the most promising way. The opening sequence is filled with a subtle but unbearable tension. Weltz amalgamates all the Nazi villains we have loved and hated in the movies into one glorious creation. (I will advise my countrymen to see it in its original multi-language version - the Italian version is another movie altogether. Some of the extra pleasures are in the dialog that, naturally, are not to be found in the Italian version) Brad Pitt, rapidly becoming one of the best character actors in the world, with a leading man's face and billing, is truly fantastic. Diane Kruger makes a credible Barbara Bouchet (one of Tarantino's muses from trash action Italian movies from the 70's) and the rest of the cast has some exquisite touches like Rod Taylor as Winston Churchill. Highly recommended for a Sunday afternoon."
Inglourious Basterds,06-Oct-09,"Everything is forgiven because ""Inglorious Basterds"" is so entertaining and at the end of the day that'ìs what matters. I think it's a pity that certain critics, specially in Italy, are determined to transform this clever pulp director into some kind of god. Maybe, partly, because Tarantino has been very clever, elevating some of the Italian pulp movies of the 60's and 70's to a sort of cult status. Italy is very grateful for that, he's rewarded with interminable praise. I fear that's the wrong approach, it's also confusing. He makes popcorn movies, brilliantly. The characters have never anything important to say, Burger King, Superman, that's the extent of its depth and I think he's tapping into a society that's getting shallower and shallower with every passing year. But, if I'm mentioning this instead of talking about all the great things I could be saying about his movie is because there is a strange force trying to brain wash me into believing that Tarantino is the most important influence in movies since time immemorial. No, he's a great director of inconsequential fun movies. I consider myself a fan and I intend to see all his future movies. This one has some wonderful touches, winking at other movies by John Sturges, Robert Aldrich etc. Brad Pitt and in particular Christoph Waltz give wonderful performances. Waltz is at the center of my favorite scenes in the film. Enjoy this movies for what it is and not for what critics are saying it is. You'll enjoy it even more that way."
Inglourious Basterds,03-Oct-09,"Brad Pitt sticks his index finger in Diane Kruger's leg wound and keeps it there until he gets what he wants. Funny, horribly so. The invented yarn takes ""The Dirty Dozen"" for a ride and sometimes abandons it to pay tribute to other movies. Lots of fun. Even ""Paris when it sizzles"" is mentioned in a delightfully organic piece of dialog. I was thrilled by Christoph Waltzer's character and by his sensational performance. Brad Pitt creates a true original. I love the actor's lack of vanity. There's a quirk in the character that is pure Brad Pitt. Tarantino visits a new universe but. fortunately, his hand. his brain and his heart are visible all over the place."
Inglourious Basterds,23-Jul-09,"It just goes to show how wrong you can be. I had not expected to like this film. I was disappointed by both the Kill Bill films (although i preferred the second) and Death Proof (although it was better in the shorter cut of the double-bill release). I love Reservoir Dogs, admire Pulp Fiction and think that Jackie Brown is Tarantino's most mature piece of film-making - technically his most superior - including the last great performance elicited from Robert De Niro. Since then it seems to me while his films have been okay (i haven't hated them) he has been treading water in referential, reverential, self-indulgent juvenilia.Then i read the script last year for Inglourious Basterds - and i hated it! Sure it had some typical QT flourishes and the opening scene was undeniably powerful. There were a couple of great characters. But on page it was more juvenile rubbish, largely ruined by the largess of the uninteresting Basterds of the title. It made me seriously contemplate not seeing the film. The trailers did nothing to convince me. I only changed by mind when i had the opportunity to see the film with a Tarantino Q&A following in London. I figured it would be worth enduring to hear him in Q&A as i know from interviews how entertaining he can be in person.So little was i prepared for the sheer exuberant fun and brilliance of Inglourious Basterds.Easily Mr Tarantino's best work since Jackie Brown it is a triumph.Yes the references are there but they do not interfere with the story, they are not the driving force. Yes Eli Roth is stunt casting but he works fine, with little to do but look aggressive, and does nothing to hurt the film as i had feared. While i admired Mr Tarantino for using stuntwoman Zoe Bell as herself in Death Proof in order to amp-up the exhilaration of the major stunt scene her lack of any acting ability in a key role was a problem for the film. The same could be said of Tarantino's own appearances in several films, especially Robert Rodriguez's From Dusk Till Dawn, which Tarantino wrote.What really makes this work is how BIG it is. The spaghetti western vibe to much of the style, dialogue and performances is wonderfully over the top without descending too far into the cartoon quality of Kill Bill. The violence is so big. The audacity so big. Brad Pitt is so big! In the trailers the Hitler moment and Pitt's performance bothered me but in the context of the film they are hilarious. Pitt is actually brilliant here, exactly what he needs to be. He is Mifune's blustering samurai in Yojimbo, he is Robards Cheyenne from Once Upon a Time in the West, there is a very James Coburn vibe to him, and of course a suitably Lee Marvin edge.Christoph Waltz (who i did not previously known) and Melanie Laurent (who i first noticed in a brilliant French-language British short film by Sean Ellis) are sensational and i expect to see both used a lot more in the future. Tarantino has clearly not lost his eye for casting, which seemed to desert him in Death Proof. Waltz is equally large in his performance. Chilling, yet theatrical. He is Fonda from OUATITW, Van Cleef from Good, The Bad & the Ugly. And Laurent is suitably Cardinale innocence but tough, a fighter. They both dazzle here.That every member of the cast gets the fun to be had from what they are doing while not indulging themselves in just having fun and trying to get laughs helps tremendously. The laughs - and there are loads - come organically. Only Mike Myers comes close to tipping the wink and pushing it too far but his scene is reigned in just enough - with the help of a fantastic Michael Fassbender who seems pulled directly from the mold of Attenborough's Great Escape leader.All the actors shine and Tarantino throws in wonderful flourishes, but ones that work with the story. The introduction of Schweiger's Hugo Stiglitz is a riot. After a sensational slow-burn opening and a glorious intro to those inglourious Basterds the pace never lets up and over two and half hours flies by.It also looks beautiful, marking this as a return to real film-making rather than just self-indulgent silliness. The musical choices, as always, are inspired from Morricone on.The film is audacious and hilarious. After a summer when nearly every film has disappointed me it came as a huge surprise that the real fun and entertaining, but also involving and impressive film should be this one, when i would never have believed it from script form. Welcome back QT."
Inglourious Basterds,25-Aug-09,"...""Inglorious"" as our local theater decided to display its title on their marquee, minus the second word. It is terrific cinema.I don't hesitate to recommend this film to all but the over-squeamish. Let them never know what they're missing.I did hesitate to give it ten stars because of my experience of Tarantino's previous films. In every case, save ""Reservoir Dogs,"" they have improved with additional watching.So although I gave it ten stars, I did so reluctantly. It leaves me no ""up"" to go to.Yes Christoph Waltz is the Nazi we've all imagined the worst to be. He is cultured, sophisticated, suave and most sadistic, the kind of man who can make a glass of milk a threat and who puts out his cigarette abruptly in a strudel, grinding it into the whipped cream as if he were grinding his heel into a victim.To understand Tarantino's films, you need only have a sense of dialogue, color and pacing. The colors are as bright as necessary and when necessary, brighter yet. In the French farmhouse of the opening scene, they are muted and dark, but excessively so. Outside a brilliant sun is shining, but in the one room of the house, everything is bathed in shadows and black.It is a brilliant setting for an interrogation by Waltz, as the ""Jew Hunter"" of the SS, who dangles his host French farmer over the precipice of revealing what he cannot reveal numerous times, then pulls him back with obsequious lines of friendship and understanding.A second sadistic German, well-played by August Diehl, later functions as important actor in the final plot twist. Diehl's Nazi Major, who has an ear for German accents, is almost as good as Waltz....almost.Film classes will study much from this movie. They should look lovingly at the superb pacing. Tarantino knows just how long to draw out a scene, building suspense in the manner of Hitchcock, then at just the breaking point, suddenly coming to a resolution.For color, look for a final shot at a French Theater, where its secretly Jewish proprietor is staging a surprise for the upper reaches of Nazi leadership.We see her, played by Melanie Laurent, awaiting the hated German dignataries who will arrive for a film preview of the latest Deutsch film masterpiece, a propaganda piece about a German hero and his dubious accomplishments.Laurent is framed on a balcony, reflected in the glass mirrors of the gorgeous theater, her red lips and low cut dress reflecting everywhere the intensity of her designs on her guests. It is a single shot that would be worth an entire film.There are thankfully many more such images, many more paced scenes of exquisite dialog and suspense.In short, see it. I'm sure you'll see it again and again."
Inglourious Basterds,14-Dec-09,"Chapter One: Once Upon a Time At A Table (1941)In which a German Nazi and a French Dairy Farmer talk at a table for 20 minutes; first in French, then in English.Chapter Two: Three Years Of Inglorious Basterds In Sixteen Minutes... Without Tables (Mostly)In which an American Lieutenant talks to his newly formed 8 man Jewish- American commando unit. There are no tables present. Cut to Adolf Hitler, three years later. He is angry at his men's inability to deal with the Basterds. Hitler does have a table. We return to the Basterds in a flashback. Again, distinct lack of table-based content. Chapter Three: German Night in Paris... At A Table... TalkingIn which a Jewish woman who escaped from under the table in Chapter One has somehow managed to become the proprietress of a cinema. The Jewish woman talks to an Actor at a table in a bar. Later, the Jewish woman, the Actor, Joseph Goebbels and a Translator talk at a table in a Restaurant. The Actor and Goebbels talk in German. The Translator translates the German into French. The Jewish woman replies in French. The Translator translates the French into German. Goebbels decides to hold a film premiere at the Jewish woman's cinema. The Actor and Goebbels leave. The Nazi (who talked with the Dairy Farmer at a table for twenty minutes back in Chapter One) arrives. He talks with the Jewish woman at the table. He leaves. The Jewish woman breaks down; overcome with emotion at having spent so long talking at a table. Chapter Four: Operation Table TalkingIn which Austin Powers sends a British Officer to join the Basterds and an Actress on a mission to talk in German at a table in a Tavern. After 21 minutes of talking at a table they all shoot each other. The actress survives but spends the next 5 minutes lying on a table talking.Chapter Five: Revenge of the Giant TableIn which, The Basterds decide to continue the operation by talking in Italian and suicide bombing the cinema. The Nazi takes the Actress into a small room where they sit next to a table. A hoe that he found under the table in the Tavern fits her so he kills her. Then he takes two of the Basterds to a big room, where they sit and talk at a table. Meanwhile, the cinema burns down, Hitler is riddled with bullets and the two Basterds blow themselves up for no good reason at all.The End"
Inglourious Basterds,23-Feb-10,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.What is the purpose of this movie? A bunch of Americans enters Nazi-occupied France and starts slaughtering Germans. You see them scalping their enemies and beating them to death with baseball bats. While making jokes, of course.Some will say that this movie is a parody of a certain genre. For a parody, it is neither witty nor funny. The contents is zero. It is exceptionally brutal and disgusting. Underneath lies a subtle political message, because it is again ""the good guys"" killing ""bad Nazis"". The whole plot is unthinkable if you turn it around. Could you imagine a storyline where Nazis (while making jokes) kill everybody in the Warsaw ghetto with flamethrowers? Probably not, but this movie is exactly about that, with the exception that is satisfies the weird moral expectations of a certain audience: slaughtering people is so cool when done by the right people.This movie only works because of the hidden Nazi-ideology underneath. It does not regard the enemy as people. And if the latter is supposed to be an element of the fun, I am happy to say that this kind of fun will always remain a mystery to me.Another mystery is how such violence can fascinate the American crowd while a bit of nudity will freak them out. But if a naked body is pornography, this movie with all its brutality is pure pornography at its very worst.Inglorious Basterds is a pointless, boring and tasteless waste of time and money."
Inglourious Basterds,02-Jun-09,"Inglorious Basterds makes no apologies, asks for no forgiveness, it's a  no holds barred assault on the senses. Tarantino doesn't care if he  offends, if he steps all over stereotypes and clichés, this is film  making at it purest. It's great to see a film maker whose work clearly  isn't interfeared with by the powers that be. Tarantino is a master of  effortlessly cranking up immense tension and suddenly mixing it with  laugh out loud moments; you're not sure if you should be looking away  in disgust or rolling around laughing, either way it's a roller coaster  and one not to be missed! It's not for everyone, certainly if you're not a fan of Tarantino's style, this may be a little hard to swallow, but  never-the-less, it is a film which simply has to be seen. No self  respecting film fan should miss this. And the performance of Christoph  Waltz... Oscar don't you dare ignore him!!"
Inglourious Basterds,23-Aug-09,"I can't imagine a director whose thirst for blood and violence is greater than Quentin Tarantino's. (At least in his films) Inglourious Basterds is no different. We all know Tarantino, the guy who exploded on the scene in the early 90s with cult classics, such as Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. Since, he has been a disappointment for some. Well, I am relieved to say, Tarantino has not lost his touch. He brings us his best since Pulp Fiction and thankfully so.We know the story, a WWII tale told only as Tarantino can. (Fictional of course) A war film hasn't been done like this before. Brad Pitt as Lt. Aldo Raine leads the Basterds in Nazi occupied France. Their goal - killin' Nazi's. Christoph Waltz as Colonel Hans Landa plays a similar role on the other side. He's know as the ""Jew Hunter"" and goes about his business as ruthless as no other. The third sub story consists of a young Jewish refugee, Shosanna Dreyfus, who witnesses the slaughter of her family. And she, of course, wishes to plot revenge on the Germans for her devastating lose. There actually is three stories here intertwining and connecting with each other. If you know anything about Tarantino or his films, this is nothing new for him.War has never been been so fun. The Basterds, are haunting, but at the same time, very funny, at times even hilarious. The dark comedy aspect play a big aspect in this as in many other Tarantino films. The entertainment and hilarity is led by Brad Pitt. I found him extremely funny and entertaining. I couldn't wait to see him on screen again. Even with his crazy accent, he works in this type of film. Also making great impressions were Mélanie Laurent and Christoph Waltz, who were tremendous. The film was filled with noteworthy performances.The story itself, has so many historical inaccuracies to even count, but so what? It isn't meant to be a documentary. Tarantino wanted to have fun with, as should we. The cinematography department deserves big props with beautiful vibrant colors highlighting the film. You've really got to love the last line in the film... but Pulp Fiction remains his masterpiece.Quentin Tarantino among all other things, is an entertainer. WWII, is one of the most tragic events in history, but Tarantino some how manages to make it fun. Inglourious Basterds is a fun film, it's tremendously entertaining, shocking, dramatic, suspenseful, and funny at the same time. Jam packed with everything you look for in a movie, done with that certain Tarantino style, it's worth being checked out. It's time to experience for yourself what war is like through the eyes of Quentin Tarantino."
Inglourious Basterds,03-Sep-09,"This usually all sounds a lot better in my head (so forgive me for rambling) I'm hardly Tarantino's biggest fan (and will *try* not to stoop to calling him a 'hack'....which is quite hard) I don't like to mock or critique a movie before seeing it. So with cautious hesitation, i walked to the cinema today to watch 'Inglorious Basterds'Now, to call it a 'rip-off of a rip-off' would be unfair here. Tarantino is happy enough to take the title from Enzo Castellari's (less than spectacular) Dirty Dozen clone, but not it's plot points (that, he takes from all other genre of movies) 'Inglorious' opens with a Nazi officer and his lengthy interrogation against a farmer who is hiding Jews in his basement. This is such an anti-climax, in that, it's dialogue is stale, and outcome signposted a mile off. Of course, one of the hidden Jews makes her escape (but more of her later) We (the obviously, easily pleased) audience are treated to the introduction of Lt. Aldo Raine (ha-ha, that name almost sounds like B-movie king ALDO RAY....ha-ha Quentin...keep those 'tributes' coming) and this character is played by none other than Brad (DALLAS) Pitt (sorry, DALLAS was about the only good thing he's ever starred in) and with jaw-jutting, Mr Jolie treats us to a hound-dogged, southern drawled, smirking Nazi-killer. Meanwhile Mr Tarantino forgets that actual grown-ups may be in attendance, so assumes that the teenyboppers won't have heard of the 'Dirty Dozen'?Raines 'platoon' consists of (John Cassavettes looking) blood-thirsty Jewish soldiers, all looking to get the big payback on Adolf Hitler. Tarantino in all his superior knowledge, pays special attention to two of these men, by casting his long time best buddy (and fellow homage-sycophant) Eli Roth (as the baseball bat wielding 'Bear Jew') The other man is called Hugo Stiglitz (and i'll wager more than half the QT fan-boys had never heard this name before this movie) Keep up the good work Tarantino, you've managed about 6 or 7 'hommages' so far (in the first 15 minutes) keep adding them, and it may detract from the plot (or lack of?)Anyhow, cutting a long (and extremely boring and protracted) story short, both Raine and his men (the 'Inglorious Basterds') and the sole survivor from chapter one, both have separate plots to kill Hitler at the showing of a Nazi-propaganda movie, in a french cinema (owned by the fore-mentioned survivor, now grown up)More boring (and pointless) conversations follow two and fro, as Pitt mugs away at an audience past caring. And any genuine suspense, leading to the assassination of the most deadly tyrant of all time, is thrown-away by the directors insistence of placing a 1980's David Bowie song in a WWII movie.My problems (and there are many) with this movie, is the re-occurring problem i have with most Tarantino product.....he rarely knows when to either start or stop. I don't need 'homage' after 'homage' to get the *joke* (whatever it may be) I knew of Inglorious Bastards, Enzo Castellari, Aldo Ray, Hugo Stiglitz (and the ultimate crime of the entire movie) Ennio Morricone's haunting score from REVOLVER. I go to the cinema to see the stars.....if the best you can do is the dire Barad Pitt, i'll assume You (Mr Tarantino) are the main draw here? I don't want the audience directing the movie. I pay to see YOUR vision, your ideas, your creativity....NOT how you can patchwork (time and time again) endless scenes from endless movies. It's high time the fan-boys (on IMDb) employed some 'tough love' on your 'idol' (god knows, if you don't....the studios should?)The tired old argument with Tarantino worshippers is ""well, if you can do better...do so"" Let me tell you, if i was a 46 year old director, with the (unfortunate) pull QT has.....i'd want to offer YOU a lot more than a warmed up muddled re-hash of better WWII movies than this tripe. The directors he attempts to emulate, made movies so bad by accident, or due to budgetary constraints. It's a cop out, time and time again, to hear his fans campaign his lack of imagination as 'art'. I'm sure he's capable of better (but after giving him the benefit of the doubt, once more....and not to mention 2 and a half hours of my life.....) maybe he isn't?"
Inglourious Basterds,23-Oct-09,"Seriously disappointing performance by Brad Pitt and Q T, the plot is very superficial and lame, and, unless indirectly intended, this film actually glorify the Nazis and portrays them as men of honor, and show that the Jewish people are deceiving, cant keep promises and bloody vicious. ((THE FOLLOWING CONTAINS SPOILER)) Hitler together with the most notorious Nazis are attending a stupid plot less movie about the killing of 300 Italian soldiers in a small cinema theater in Paris is unbelievably ridiculous. the Nazis laughing and hooraying each killing in the movie as if watching a basketball game STUPID, the deal at the end is lame. whats really appalling is that the movie earned great reviews and is ranked here in the 40s amongst the greatest 250 films. will not be surprised if it harvested many awards, including Oscars, as well. the movie is simply a kissing ass to the Jewish people, but hey reconsider, its not even doing a great job doing that. it truly dwarfed the whole Nazi - Jews conflict and a pure insult to all who fought and suffered from the tyranny of the Nazis."
Inglourious Basterds,21-Jan-10,"For those that have studied WWII, and unfortunately, seen real human brains on the ground, this movie is a travesty, a sadistic farce, and a complete waste of time like most of Tarantino's other questionable work. I do admit to liking ""Reservoir Dogs"" to a point. However, this thing does not even have an original title.I (unfortunately) received this DVD by mistake and see this project as a new low for Brad Pitt and the other actors taking part in this joke of making jews more barbaric than the Nazis. It perpetuates blame on the common German soldiers while covering up the major part US and UK bankers like Prescott Bush had in funding Hitler, as well as, the now confirmed part that British Intelligence had in bringing Hitler and Mussolini to power beginning immediately at the end of WWI.WWII was a complex and tragic event, and the real world history deserves better than this self serving, mythological blood feast served up for fools too lazy to look for the truth and try to prevent a recurrence. History can repeat itself when we become manipulated by propaganda, desensitized to inhumane actions, and self righteous.If you want to look at atrocities, many can argue that Stalin made Hitler and the Nazis look like rank amateurs in the business of murdering innocent people, as well as, the drug crazed gangs of Niger roping off streets with human intestines. Where does it end? We need to be getting the multitude of shadowy intelligence agencies under control and accountability instead of getting a cheap emotional thrill about perpetuating their myths in Hollywood and our capitol cities."
Inglourious Basterds,12-Sep-09,"""Inglourious Basterds"" is supposed to be Quentin Tarantino's homage to the Spaghetti Western. And here's what is interesting: Tarantino has had 40 years to improve on Sergio Leone's 1960s masterpieces. And he's failed miserably.""Basterds"" is a rambling, incoherent mess of a movie. It's obvious that Tarantino desperately wants to be the ultimate ""bad boy"" of cinema who makes ""controversial"" films. But if Tarantino really wanted to be controversial in making a war film, he'd tackle the horrors of the Iraq War, instead of World War II, a long-ago war that already has been re-hashed over and over from every conceivable angle over the decades.Tarantino deeply wants to shock us, to outrage us and to create disturbing art. And he fails miserably. The fact is, Leone was infinitely more daring and controversial way back in 1968 than Tarantino ever has been. When Leone depicted the vicious cold-blooded gunning down of a child in ""Once Upon a Time in the West,"" he created a scene that Tarantino would never, ever have the courage to film. Compared to scenes like that, everything in ""Basterds"" is tame and predictable (as is the case with all of Tarantino's work).Last, but not least, I really can't understand why anyone would be interested in Tarantino's take on the 1960s Spaghetti Western film genre. I mean, why not just watch the stunning originals? The original Italian directors did vastly more with their tiny budgets than Tarantino can do with his bloated $80 million budgets.If you want truly challenging and original film-making these days, I urge you to check out the best of what East Asian cinema has to offer. (Takashi Miike is infinitely more daring, dangerous and talented than Tarantino). Tarantino is a grossly overrated director and the fact that his work is praised in the U.S. shows just how utterly creatively bankrupt Hollywood is these days."
Inglourious Basterds,14-Sep-09,"I will never go to another Tarantino movie again. The entire film was worthless. My wife and I both regret that we didn't get up and walk out at the first indication of what the film was really going to be about (which is still hard to determine since it was such a ridiculous storyline...blood, guts, and violence seemed to be the only real theme), but we kept hoping there'd be something redeeming just around the corner. Unfortunately, there wasn't because there wasn't anything that made sense! We, along with a lot of the other people in the audience walked out of the theater muttering ""that was disgusting"", ""what a waste of time"", ""I should've walked out"", ""where was the comedy"", ""that was pathetic"", etc. It actually made us, the audience, voice our disgust and the feeling that we had just been thoroughly ripped off. The only thing of merit in the film was the costuming and the acting ability of almost everyone in the film....there just wasn't a plot/script worthy of their talents. I rate this a 1 because there isn't a 0. I can't quite understand how anyone could rate this higher than a 0!"
Inglourious Basterds,26-Sep-09,"Previous Tarantino movies were from a guy in love with other movies. This one is from a guy in love with his own writing. It isn't Inglorious, its disgusting.I absolutely hated Inglorious Basterds. The entire point of a film is to entertain - if u call bashing people's heads and removing their scalps entertaining!!!! - and if there is one unforgivable sin a movie can commit, it is extreme boredom or disgust.The movie is just a collection of endless and excruciatingly boring and disgusting scenes of people talking at tables in various languages. There is even one scene where 3 people talk for nearly 45 minutes at the same table, before, thankfully they are all shot. I wished they would have been killed off after 5 minutes. Even Woody Allen knows when to shut the F**K up.This table talk style is a Tarantino hallmark, but in other films, I actually cared about what they were saying and the people who were talking. Here, I couldn't care less. All of Quentin's films display an enormous confidence, particularly Jackie Brown. But here there is a pervasive feeling in every scene, Tarantino had no idea where he was going with the film.Is it violent? Sure there's torture and scalping galore, but you'd have to remind me. Thankfully, the film was so thin, I didn't even remember I had seen it earlier in the day when until I saw a review headline on MSNBC.He's out of gimmicks and apparently dying to write a novel. But do us a favor QT and spare us the movie.I walked out of this movie halfway through and I would never recommend anyone seeing it no matter what a die-hard quarantino fan he or she is.I give it 0 / 10."
Inglourious Basterds,13-Mar-10,"Reviews of this film are largely split into 2 camps; it's good because, or it's bad despite, it's direction by Tarantino.The question I asked myself after this was would this have been made without the Pitt/ Tarantino stamp? The answer was no; and the result was a film that made me so irate that I was moved to post my first review on IMDb...I found everything about this film treated the film goer with something approaching contempt. The script was thin with the exception of one well written character - Landa. Scripting for other characters was anodyne or non-existent, or, in the case of the ""Jew-Bear"", simply a bit weird. Same for the other aspects of characterisation, that was formulaic and thin in nearly every case, especially the made-for-Pitt Aldo Raine and the other Basterds. Style pastiching that normally works didn't; subject matter was treated with either insufficient levity or indifference; scenes were badly edited or irrelevant. The redeeming aspects were cinematography and production values - style over content.So - am I taking it too seriously? No; this is not a funny film (though occasionally it seems to try) and the violence that is shown sits uneasily between cartoonish and unnecessary - a prime example is that of the surrendered German who was beaten to death; added nothing, in any way. In fact the tone of the film was so inconsistent in the way it considered the material that it made me very uneasy.For me - Tarantino needs to start making films to impress others, not just himself. Obviously (most of) the rest of the world disagrees, but that's something either Mr T or I will have to learn to live with...One of the most disappointing films I've seen."
Inglourious Basterds,04-Feb-10,"I simply cannot believe this movie's current rating on IMDb.It is currently sitting in the IMDb top 100, nestled closely with The Bridge on the River Kwai, Raging Bull and the Prestige.To find this movie in the same standing as those three is truly staggering to me. Hence I am taking the time to give this film 1 star, to hopefully help get it down towards its rightful place among the other pieces of truly worthless cinema with which it belongs.I can understand that this is a movie that you either love or hate - it is certainly true that it is both a provocative and original film. However, what surprises me is the massive bias towards the ""love"" side, given the film's content - which can be summarised as an unashamedly unrealistic and soulless collection of sadistic/casual mindless violence, strangely blended with dramatic scenes of the kind of things that genuinely took place under the Nazis.What I am trying to say is that combining very tense, well written SS interrogation scenes (which evoke some genuine emotional investment in the film) with comic book character British generals/Nazi leaders/Jewish soldiers makes for an extremely uncomfortable combination for me. At times it feels like someone has spliced together Schindlers List with Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.My best guess is that the film's originality and uncompromising approach is refreshing to people bored of the same old Hollywood formulae. Certainly the film is unpredictable. The plot (such as it is) is extremely meandering and many of the characters' actions are pretty much inexplicable. *SPOILER* (I point here towards Colonel Landa's killing of Bridget and his non-killing of Shosanna.) But then again every single character is so one dimensional that it leaves you with no idea which characters you are supposed to actually care about anyway. There is no real shock when anyone gets killed because you don't know who anyone is or what makes them tick.Brad Pitt gets the award here for the most wooden and pointless character to appear - he is truly awful throughout the film and finds himself in a role where he does not have to portray a single emotion throughout the film. Nothing.My final point is that originality on its own does not make a great film. Yes, Tarantino has made a movie where you see things that you have never seen before in a major Hollywood release, but that is not any sort of achievement. The reason a high budget film has not been made before where the entire German high command has a day at the cinema in occupied France with almost no guards or security is because that idea is stupid. Yes, the film is stupid - and no amount of brushing over with ""Tarantino is being postmodern"" or ""he's being ironic"" will overcome that plain fact.In summary this is a film that takes an exploitation film script, (that would ordinarily be filed under ""trash cinema"") gives it a big name director/very high quality cast and then takes the plaudits for being ground breaking.It is not. It is simply a steaming turd given a coat of gloss paint."
Inglourious Basterds,03-Oct-09,"Very entertaining, that's for sure. Great little moments ""inspired"" by other movies. ""The Guns Of Navarone"", ""Operation Crossbow"" and a myriad of 70's B exploitation Italian movies. Tarantino is certainly clever and knows how to use the camera but then, I have to say it, nothing. The childish ""divertimento"" dressed in smart ass dialog remains there. The entertainment value is, perhaps, the most one should expect from a movie but it seems a damn shame that such a talent should be put at the service of something so one dimensional. I can't help but remember Ernst Lubitch's ""To Be Or Not To Be"" that was also a comedy with remarkable, inventive dialog but it also had so many other layers that ""To Be Or Not To Be"" after 70 years still resonates with whoever has seen it. Christoph Waltz is terrific and Brad Pitt is always great fun to watch but the experience is purely epidermic in spite of some truly gruesome moments. Am I expecting oranges from an apple tree? If that's so forget what I've just said and run to meet Tarantino's basterds."
Stand by Me,22-Jan-99,"I find it hard to comment on this film without simply repeating what has already been said. It's not that I can't think of anything original, but that others seem to have felt the exact same emotions as I did when watching this film.I saw this movie when I was about 12, 13, maybe 14 years old. So it didn't have the same nostalgic sense it had for so many. But what it did, was make me ache for those memories. I wanted (in the words of another reviewer) to be 12, and *that* cool. I wished I had been like that, that I had had friends like that, laughed like that, and had adventures like that.The 'milk-money' scene was probably one of my all-time favourite scenes in movie history. Up until I saw this movie I had never held much regard for River Phoenix, but the poignancy and sincerity which River added to the role of Chris Chambers touched me to the point of tears. I read in yet another review that in this scene, River was asked to think of a time when he had been hurt by an adult, and that even after the cameras stopped rolling, River sat there still, sobbing and hurting. And I felt every tear and heard every word as though I were there with Chris.This movie made me laugh, cry, rejoice and fear with Chris, Gordie, Teddy and Vern. I loved the campfire scenes, and today I look back on my own childhood, and remember with a laugh the amazingly similar things I used to laugh and wonder about with my friends. I remember dreaming about being a writer and an actress, I remember standing up to bullies, I remember walking or riding with my friends, I remember being afraid, and crying onto a friend's shoulder.I guess what this movie does for everyone, is take them back in time, even though the situations may have been different, chances are you'll find the similarities, and remember with a smile that yes, your life was once *that* cool. In the words of Vern, ""a great time""I especially loved the ending. That they found out who was strong, and who just talked tough. I loved the last scene with Chris and Gordie, and the closing monologue.""I never had any friends later on, like the ones I had when I was twelve...Jesus....does anyone?"""
Stand by Me,09-Dec-04,"This film is a brilliant, well-acted masterpiece! What touched me the most was the late River Phoenix's acting, but all of the young actors performances were incredible. They are why you should see this film. 'Stand By Me' is not a bubblegum Disney film, nor a dry Hollywood film; it is a movie that captures childhood in a poignant, non-candy coated manner that is dead on. I saw this movie only a couple months ago and was blown away by it's style and acting. It is rare that you see such fresh, relaxed and deep performances that the actors in this film offered. Although this is not a recent film, it is a genuine, inspiring film that is so refreshing-being so different than the films Hollywood often gives us. I give this film a 100+ and recommend it to everyone. You will benefit from it's message and it's wonderful acting."
Stand by Me,02-Apr-01,"Stand By Me is yet another one of the stories made into a movie from the author who has had more stories made into movies than any other author in history, Stephen King. Clearly, the central character here is Gordie Lachance, from whose point of view the story is told and who obviously symbolizes King himself, given many of his characteristics as well as some of the content of the film. This movie is literally filled with actors who have achieved varying degrees of success over the years, such as Jerry O'Connell, who played Vern, River Phoenix, who could have been bigger than Leonardo DiCaprio if he hadn't died, Corey Feldman, who has grown into an unenviable but visible existence, Kiefer Sutherland, who has become an excellent and very well known actor, John Cusack can be seen in a small role as Gordie's late brother, and of course, Richard Dreyfuss, who played the narrator and Gordie as an adult, has remained famous but originally achieved fame more than a decade before Stand By Me was filmed or the original story was even written.Stand By Me takes place in the summer of 1959, the general time period that Stephen King is most skilled at presenting, and four friends set out to find the body of a kid who was killed by a train, hoping to find what they predicted would be astronomical fame. Unfortunately, the town's bullies are also out to find the body for the same reason, which leads to the films ultimate final climax. Even though this is a very clever story with which to tell a fall from innocence story, it is the brilliant characterization and the incredible acting that really make this a classic film. It is extremely rare that a film comes along that stars young kids and is so moving and powerful. Also, every one of those kids is made three dimensional in creative and smooth ways, making you feel like you really knew them by the end of the film. Vern is the fat kid who always gets picked on, Teddy and Chris both have abusive or deranged fathers, not to mention Chris's cruel brother, and Gordie is a young boy who lost his brother three months earlier in a violent accident and who has been largely ignored by his parents ever since. In one memorable scene, Gordie wonders how Teddy can be so enthusiastic about his father's alleged military achievements when the man once held his head to a stove, nearly burning his ear off. Gordie is mystified because he could care less about his own father, who hadn't laid a hand on him since he was three years old and got caught `eating bleach under the sink.'Stephen King pokes fun at his own craft many times in the film, such as in Gordie's vehement line, `F*ck writing. I don't want to be a writer, it's a stupid waste of time!' Not only that, but there are also obvious references to his other works, such as when the boys first realize that no one brought food, and Teddy says, `This is great, what are we supposed to do, eat our feet?' People who actually read instead of just lazily watching the movies will recognize this as a major part of the plot of another of King's short stories, `Survivor Type,' from which Cast Away borrowed heavily. And why don't you people read these books? `The Body,' which Stand By Me was based on, is only 148 pages long, you could read that in a couple of hours and the experience is totally different from a movie. It's even more disturbing that `The Body' was published in the same book (Different Seasons) as a couple of King's other famous stories  `Apt Pupil' and, of course, `Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption.'Stand By Me is a story of how one event can unexpectedly change lives. It seems to be a story about friends and how important they are, but this possible theme is clearly dispelled in a line from the narration spoken at the end of the film  `As time went on, we saw less and less of Teddy and Vern, until eventually they became just two more faces in the halls. It happens sometimes, friends come in and out of your life like busboys at a restaurant.' Instead, the film is about learning from a life changing experience and actually making changes or modifying your life in some way because of it, and this is heavily emphasized at the end of the film.Stand By Me is a timeless film. Stephen King's story is skillfully brought to the screen under the direction of Rob Reiner, and the 1950s are brought back to life just as successfully as King so often does in his stories and novels, with the slicked back hair, the hot rods, and in the film, and excellent 50s soundtrack. There is so much more to this film than just the superficial story  things about the characters and the story, but also about the tremendously talented man who wrote it all."
Stand by Me,03-Dec-03,"Without a doubt this movie is probably the best coming of age flick around, it has terrific acting and an incredibly touching plot that keeps you going throughout the whole film. I think the reason I love this film so much is because, everyone in some way could relate to it. When you're a pre-teen and have a close group of friends and face something so intense together, there's that special bond that no matter how much you loose touch with each other, one day, you just think of them and that one incident.Stand by Me is about 4 pre-teen boys whose summer is about to end and they are about to start junior high. They've obviously grown up together and are nervous of the world they are about to face, where they are no longer kids, but just about to become adults. When their friend, Vern, tells them about a kid their age that is missing that he found out by listening in on his brother where the kid's body is, the boys think it would be so cool to find the body and become the local town heroes. They have one problem though, there are these big tough guys who want to find the body first, it's a matter of who will reach it first. But of course, it's the bonding of the boys that really gets you into the film.These are some of the best characters I have seen on film, we start with Gordy. Gordy is an intelligent writer who lost his big brother, his idol, in a car crash recently and can't get any love or respect from his father and it's obvious that he gets it from his friends. That's what keeps him going. Chris is the leader of the gang and Gordy's best friend, he comes from a very bad family and is dubbed the bad seed everywhere, he's the kid who you knew in school and just knew he'd turn out bad, but there's a deeper side to him. The speech that River Phoenix turned out for Chris was so beautifully dilvered as a child who's been disappointed so many times by an adult.Teddy is another bad kid sort of speak, he has a bad home life where his father is crazy and nearly killed him a few times. He has a quick temper, but you can tell that his friends keep him down to Earth and help him through the worst times. Then there's Vern, the funny fat kid who is pretty much scarred of everything, and in some ways is the 4th wheel. Still, Vern you can tell is a great friend and the other's appreciate him despite how he can hold them back.The acting is just phenomenal. Now, the directing, Rob Reiner is without a doubt one of the best directors of all time, he took these young boys and pushed them to their limits, he was so smart about it as well. He said in an interview that he had to get pre-teen boys who were close to the personality of the character in the film, so it would come natural to the pre-teen actors, and you could tell that this film was his baby, he put so much thought and love into this film. That's what makes this film so special, nothing could ever compete with a coming of age film like Stand By Me.10/10"
Stand by Me,16-Oct-05,"I am 14 years old, and I absolutely love this movie. But don't let my age fool you. I'm not just going to sit here and talk about how hott River Pheonix was.This movie is well rounded in my perspective. Everyone can relate to at least one of the boys in it at one time in their life. The actors are matched perfectly with who their character portrays.Corey Feldman's character Teddy is the boy who's sensitive about his dad, but tries to hide it, Jerry O' Connell's character Vern is the chubby, wussy kid, but still part of the club, Wil Wheaton's character Gordie is the sweet, intelligent friend who tells stories to the other boys and is ignored by his parents, and River Phoenix's character Chris is the boy in the neighborhood that's been labeled a bad kid and feels he'll never get out of their town, the peacemaker, and Gordie's best friend. This movie just sucks you in as soon as you start watching it. It's not overly mushy and sad, but it's not so tough that only a sixteen year old boy could stand it. You feel for each character, no matter how mean or nice they are. My personal favorite is Chris Chambers, which i know this will probably drive you guys nuts that almost every other person does too, but River Phoenix is just so touching. The campfire scene is great, the milk money seen is great, and one of my favorites is the train scene. You can definitely see the terror in their faces. It's funny that they all act so tough, except maybe Vern, although he tries, and they still like talking about goofy and dancing and singing along to Lollipop. You also just want to be there with them. Feel that kind of friendship that so many people long for. It's such a feel good movie, but not in the sense of a 10 year old's feel good movie. It makes you feel complete when you watch it. It's not jam packed with action sequences or it doesn't have fluffy pink bunnies hopping around in it either. It's just one of a kind. Definitely worth my time and yours.The newest DVD of Stand By Me (Special Edition) has Walking the Tracks: The Summer of Stand By Me where all the main actors,except River, and Rob Reiner are interviewed. They also talk about working with River Phoenix. There's also the Stand By Me music video with River Phoenix, Wil Wheaton, and obviously Ben E. King. Not to mention an extra CD with some awesome oldie's songs like Everyday, Lollipop, Stand By Me, and Mr. Lee."
Stand by Me,05-Jul-99,"Growing up isn't easy for anyone. There are times when you feel no one understands you at all. Although growing up is tough, the friends you have at a young age are the friends you'll remember for the rest of your life. Stand By Me is a very wonderful film, a masterpiece on a small scale. The film is full of great insights into the minds of a group of four boys who decide they want to see what a dead body looks like, and it sparks their interest even more that they actually knew this dead person. A young boy's mind is full of many things, they feel lost sometimes, strong at others, but mostly they feel invinceable. Rob Reiner has directed a film about four young boys who discover life is quick, sometimes merciless, and magical. I've seen this film numerous times and it always seems better than the time before. This is a perfect little film."
Stand by Me,08-Mar-00,"As a lover of Stephen King's writing style and Rob Reiner's directing techniques, this movie leaves me speechless every time. It is an almost forgotten film about a time and a youth nearly forgotten, as well. And I will say, as a writer, the novella that this film was based upon, ""The Body"" has and always will be the inspiration for my style of writing.First of all, I enjoy the title that was chosen for the film. ""Stand By Me"" fits what the characters in the story are facing.  I think that all who have seen this film will agree that the problems are all things that we can relate to.  All of us know someone like these characters. Most of us have met the boy down the road who had a brother with a bad name and a father with an alcohol problem, automatically being labeled as a ""bad kid."" And the boy with the military father, abusive and a little whacko. The fat kid, picked on and ridiculed for his weight.To me, Gordy represents all of us. I found myself seeing a little of me in Gordy as I watched the film. I don't know if any one else shares this, but it was true. Gordy was not very strong, at first, and was not sure what he wanted, except to be with his friends. Still coping with the loss of his brother and the fact that his father was disrespectful to him, Gordy still stood up for what he believed in. And, in the end he surprised the characters and the viewers by standing up to the bullies that had plagued them all.This film is certainly one of my top favorites. In fact, it lies in my top three, probably at #2 or #3. I feel that it is a film that everyone should see at some point in their life due to the fact it changes your look at youth and their trials. Few films are able to do that and I think that this one was an inspiration for others that will do the same in the future."
Stand by Me,02-Jul-99,"Perhaps this is a personal bias because I had friends like this when I was 12, but having said that this is one of the best films I have ever seen and it hits every chord perfectly.There were four of us that were friends and we were known as the Stand By Me Crew. Mike, Gary, Andy and myself were inseparable. And as this film prophesizes correctly, the group has since split up and now I am only good friends with one of them. This movie makes you remember what it was like to have friends when you were 12 and it makes you glad that they were there when they were.The story involves these four kids going on a weekend hike to find a dead kid that apparently got hit by a train. Now if that is all the movie was about, it would probably be pretty boring. But this film explores the fears and anxieties of what it was like to be 12 again. Twelve year olds deal with a plethora of issues and it is not often that adults listen to what kids have to say or see what they deal with. But this film is honest about it's assessment of how they feel.The four boys are played brilliantly by Wil Wheaton, Jerry O'ConnellCoosh from Jerry Maguire ), Corey Feldman and River Phoenix. The story moves along and hits a nerve because of the life that these four actors brings to their characters. There is a real sense of comrarderie between the four of them. But ultimately it is Phoenix that brings the most life to his character and I would say that the milk money scene with him and Gordie (Wheaton) is one of the more touching and poignant scenes ever filmed.What Stand By Me does is brings you back to a time when friendship was more pure and innocent and meant more. You can't help but get caught up in the nostalgia. Perhaps this film means more to me for personal reasons ( as I've already stated ) but it is a wonderful film and it should be enjoyed by everyone.The last line of the movie is so true. Do we really ever have friends as good as the ones when we were twelve? I doubt it."
Stand by Me,13-Jan-03,"Stephen King adaptations can be great. In my opinion the less horror pictures, and The Shining, are the best. Misery, The Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile and this one. Stand by Me is a great film, you can say it is a drama with some thriller elements.Four boys hear the location of the dead body of a boy from their small town. The boys go on a trip to look for the body, about 30 miles away. There are some little problems on the way, including another gang with its leader Kiefer Sutherland. One of the boys thinks about his late brother because of the recent events, played by John Cusack. It seems to be a simple story but it is told perfect.The performances the boys give, one of them is the late River Phoenix, are all extraordinary. I liked the way their friendship was shown. Just a great movie, see this. 9/10."
Stand by Me,08-Sep-15,"""It happens sometimes. Friends come in and out of our lives, like busboys in a restaurant.""Stand By Me is Rob Reiner's love letter to friendship and nostalgic memories. It's ironic that Reiner's film looks at the past with such high regards because we can do the same with his filmography. His best films were all made in the 80's (and we can squeeze Misery and A Few Good Men into that list as well although they came out in 1990 and 1992 respectively), and despite not having directed many great films over the past few decades we can still look back at his early films and appreciate his classics. Stand By Me reminds us all of our early childhood and the friendships we made. It doesn't matter what decade we grew up in, we all cherish special memories of adventures we shared with our friends and how they helped shape us. That is what is so universal and appealing about Reiner's film; even though we may never have grown up in a small town or had similar outdoor adventures it still recalls us back to a time where we were discovering new things about the world and standing up for our friends when they were in trouble or running with them when we got caught playing in our neighbor's yards. Stand By Me focuses on these memories and it's not just about the adventure in itself but the bond these friends shared together. It's probably the go to movie when we are comparing or referencing other coming of age films, and in my opinion one of the best ever made considering how much I appreciate the genre. I'm sure the film itself was a life changing experience for many who grew up watching it and dreaming of having similar adventures with their friends.Based on Stephen King's short story, ""The Body,"" the screenplay for the film was adapted by Raynold Gideon and Bruce Evans. It takes place in 1959 and centers on four 12 year old friends from Castelrock, Oregon who overhear a conversation about the location of the body of a dead boy who had been missing for several days. The news about the disappearance of this boy had spread all over town, so these kids decide to embark on an adventure through the woods and bring back the missing body so they can be received as heroes. Since the journey would take more than a full day, they plan to tell their parents that they are staying at each other's home. Gordie (Will Wheaton) had recently lost his older brother (played by John Cusack in the flashback scenes) a few months prior to this in a car accident so he knew his mourning parents wouldn't even mind him being gone for a few days. His best friend, Chris (River Phoenix), came from a troublesome family and despite knowing he'd get into trouble if they'd discover his lie he didn't think it would be any different if he stayed with his drunk father. Teddy (Corey Feldman) still has the scars from the abuse he suffered from his mentally unstable father, and currently lives with his mother. Vern (Jerry O'Connell), the clown of the group who isn't taken very seriously is the one who came up with the idea of looking for the body, but he also is the first to back down when it comes to it. The four finally decide to go ahead with their plan and begin their adventure, which will eventually shape who they are. The story is narrated by the grown up version of Gordie (played by Richard Dreyfuss) somewhere around 1985.The strong performances in this film are one of the reasons why it continues to work today. River Phoenix was such a natural and is so charismatic that he steals every scene he's in. The chemistry he shares with Wheaton's character is strong and it reminds us all of that best friend we had in our childhood. Corey Feldman must have had the best agent because he starred in some of the best films that were released in the 80's (Gremlins, The Goonies, The Burbs, and The Lost Boys). Jerry O'Connell is probably the one that has undergone the greatest physical transformation, but he was perfect for the role of Vern and he reminded us of that friend who always seemed to be the butt of every joke. These four young actors carry the film and despite not having the most exciting of adventures, the way the story is told is what makes it such a fascinating one. There are small moments like the one where they gather around the camp fire to listen to Gordie's story, or when they are crossing the pond and discover its full of leeches, that stand out. The film is told through Gordie's recollection of these events and each scene feels like an authentic memory someone would have of such a life changing experience. The 50's soundtrack also plays a key role in the film since it adds to the overall sense of nostalgia. Reiner's film reminds me how much I actually have enjoyed Stephen King's non-horror stories (this along with Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile are my favorite film adaptations of his work). Since its 1986 release, all the coming of age films that have followed it seem to heavily borrow from it. Stand By Me is the measuring stick for films in this genre.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"
Stand by Me,10-Jul-05,"Hands down this is my favorite movie. (With the Sandlot in second place). My mom got this movie for me when i was about 12. I saw it the first time and realized that i had friends like that. The movie is definitely one every teenage kid should see. I think it is more of a movie for boys but girls can get out of it the same as the boys can. But the movie overall is great because its just about a four friends who have no experience with the ""real world"". They find out about a dead body and go in search to find it. At first they just do it to be famous and get a reward. But the quest of the boys throughout the movie reveal things that even themselves didn't know about. After it all, the boys find out about reality, and how it isn't glamorous. They realize that the body could of been them and they respect that. In my opinion the point of the movie was not to have you think of when you were 12 and your good friends but to think of what you have now, and what you do with it. In the end Gordie tells us what happens to each and how each kind of go their separate ways. (Such as the last scene of the movie). This is definitely a movie to not only rent but buy. I tip my hat to Reiner."
Stand by Me,29-Dec-00,"In ancient Greece people watched the great tragedies in the amphi-theatres, and eyewitnesses tell us that audiences of 20'000 sat crying when the main character on the stage became aware of his fatal guilt and had to face death. They called it catharsis, best translated by 'cleaning the souls'. Well, measured by the tremendous effect on all of us writing reviews on the film, STAND BY ME has the power and qualities of ancient tragedy. This jewel of a film touches and shakes the best sides in us. I have watched it over and over again, and even if I watch it several times a week I still sit and laugh and cry, and it leaves me sad and confused and grateful, feelings that can last for hours and sometimes days.So what is the mystery behind this masterpiece?First of all it teaches us that good filmmaking isn't about the dollars spent on the production, but about the people who make it.And it's about a unique and humble (I hope you understand what I mean) director: Rob Reiner doesn't try to show how good he is, leering at the Oscar-jury:the story is told without any visual effects, the pace is slow and the cinematography is unspectacular, but he succeeds in inspiring his young actors to perform honest feelings and letting the story develop by its own terms. An example is the milkmoney-scene. It is told that Reiner wasn't satisfied with the performance of River Phoenix. They tried again and again. Finally, he told River to remember a situation of his own life where a grownup had let him down. Guess if he succeeded with it! River Phoenix started crying and he couldn't stop crying a long time after the shot was taken. That's why this film is pure gold: it doesn't show professional acting, it shows young boys who open their hearts in front of a camera. They can do it, because they can relate to similar experiences and because the message is important and universal. We all can relate to similar situations. These scenes make me remember events from my own youth that I had inhibited for a long time, because I didn't like to remember them. That's the pain!But it's not only the director and the actors who should earn all the credits. I read the novel after watching the film, and since that time Stephen King is one of the great contemporary writers in my book. I just don't understand why he doesn't write more of THE BODY kind. To me this book is pure poetry (including all those four-letter-words that Maltin e. a. don't like, because they don't understand why they are necessary)! But the most amazing thing is: the script doesn't only catch the quintessence of the novel, it's partly even better! This perfect balance between humor and seriousness! It doesn't manipulate the audience. In the book grownup Gordon sits in his car when he had read about his friend's death. ""I drove out of town, parked, and cried for him. Cried for damn near half an hour, I guess."" In the film Gordon doesn't cry. He doesn't need to. Everyone in the audience feels like crying, because they understand the tragedy! There are only 13 pages of dialogue and narration, and there really is not one line too much. It's so good, I almost know the whole of it by heart. Take the ending: In the book, the famous writer Gordon Lachance tells about how he met Ace Merrill again, some twenty years after the Ray Brower event: grown fat and the only one alive of his old friends and enemies. How much better is the film's ending! This important line about the friends we had when we were twelve years old is only a line in King's book, commending the good time the boys have at Milo Pressman's junkyard! If there had been an Oscar for impressive film endings, this film had deserved the first!And thank you Jack Nitzsche for the intense score. It's Gordie's theme, when he's not with his friends. In the group Gordie is the smart boy with the sharp, quick, fresh replies. Without the friends, at home or in the store he barely speaks a word. And then we can hear that fragile Jack Nitzsche variation on Stand by me. It's like Gordie crying `where are you, Chris? Come, stand by me'. That's brilliant and exactly what great filmmusic should be: serving the film's dramaturgy.Well, I don't know how many hours it took me to express my love to this film in a language that isn't my own. It seems impossible. It is exactly as Stephen King expressed it himself (end of chapter 29): `Even if I'd known the right thing to say, I probably couldn't have said it. Speech destroys the functions of love, I think - that's a hell of a thing for a writer to say, I guess, but I believe it to be true. If you speak to tell a deer you mean it no harm, it glides away with a single flip of its tail. The word is the harm. Love isn't what these asshole poets like McKuen want you to think it is. Love has teeth; they bite; the wounds never close. No word, no combination of words, can close those lovebites. It's the other way around, that's the joke. If those wounds dry up, the words die with them. Take it from me. I've made my life from the words, and I know that is so.'10 out of 10, no doubt about it!"
Stand by Me,28-Apr-06,"Stand By Me is without a doubt one of the finest pieces of film ever made in the history of humanity. A truly excellent movie that really strikes and affects you with all its glory. It leaves no one untouched whether you're 12 or 112 years old. Simply because it deals with life and friendship, and all that comes with it. Both the good and the bad.Everyone can relate to it and feel what the characters feel. Because we've all been there. We have all done similar things to what they are doing, we have all been dealing with the same issues in life as they are faced with and we all still are.Few films are able do depict the theme of life and friendship as successfully as Stand By Me. In my opinion there are practically no flaws in this production, everything from the plot and the screenplay to the characters and the actors are top notch. Also the music is great.Watching the movie one feel everything from happiness and laughter to fear and grief. Laughter because we remember how fun it was being a child. With everything being new and exciting in life. And facing it all together with our friends. Fear and grief because of how hard it can be having to grow up and let go of the past. Let go of our old friends and our old life. One can't help but to feel nostalgic. At least I do. It makes me think about life in a larger sense. Thinking about my childhood I realize how long ago it was or at least seems to be. The movie frees a lot of emotions and thoughts regarding both my own life and life in general.This movie also has one of the best opening scenes in film history. I almost burst into tears every time I see it. It's as close to perfection as it gets. It's so beautiful and sad. Simply the perfect way to launch the rest of the movie. How the beautiful soft music first almost reaches out and touch you, while seeing the landscape. Then a close up on the car and the main character reading the chocking news of his dear old friend's death. Thereafter such a smooth passage back to his childhood with focus on the kids passing by on their bikes and the music still in the background. Excellent!To conclude I have also one little flaw, or at least I think of it that way. It's regarding the whole ""Lardass-scence"". When I was little I could never figure out why it was in the film. I couldn't see the connection to the rest of the film. Being older and hopefully a little wiser :D I now see that it's a way of showing Gordies talent for making up stories, the talent that have him becoming a writer one day. However I feel this could have been illustrated in a better way. I've always felt that scene is just a little bit over the top and I still do. Otherwise Stand By Me is close to a masterpiece. No one should go through life without seeing and experiencing this wonderful film."
Stand by Me,18-Oct-18,"Another GREAT 80s FILM EASY way for me to say. DO NOT REMAKE THIS FILM IT IS ONE OF 80s BEST FILM'S EVER MADE.
Vern was one of my favorite KIDS in the FILM.
He was AWESOME I liked how Corey Played the LOONEY KID. YOU CAN'T MAKE THIS MOVIE BETTER SO LEAVE IT ALONE."
Stand by Me,30-Oct-17,"In 1959, in Castle Rock, Oregon, the boys Gordie Lachance (Wil Wheaton), Chris Chambers (River Phoenix), Teddy Duchamp (Corey Feldman) and Vern Tessio (Jerry O'Connell) learn that the teenager Ray Brower, who is missing, was hit by a train and is dead in a nearby river. They decide to find the body to become local heroes and along their journey, they disclose secrets and learn the importance of their friendship.""Stand by Me"" is another nostalgic little gem from the 80's with a coming-of-age drama, with funny and heartbreaking moments. The plot is simple but realistic and supported by a group of promising young actors. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Conta Comigo"" (""Count on Me"")"
Stand by Me,18-Oct-05,"Stand By Me is probably the best film ever to come from a Stephen King story. (The Green Mile sucks, by the way.) The story is told from an adult writer's point of view as he recounts an adventure he shared with his three best friends in the waning moments of the summer before junior high school began. We see the four boys head out into the wilderness to see the dead body of a boy who was apparently hit by a train. The boys encounter bullies, other trains, leeches, vicious dogs, and many other things on their trip. And they have some pretty deep and emotional conversations along the way.This is a very awkward age in the life of a young man. You can tell by listening to their conversation topics which range from boobs to whether or not Mighty Mouse can beat up Superman. The youngsters are portrayed flawlessly by four terrific young actors. Who would have thunk that Jerry O'Connell would turn out to be the most successful of them? At times they laugh, other times they pick on each other. Sometimes they seem on the verge of fighting, but when challenged by the older gang of bullies, they stick together. Richard Dreyfuss, who plays the adult writer, narrates the action as things move along. Their trip is full of surprises and emotional insight.Stand By Me is not quite a classic in my book, but it is very memorable. The script is a little too pessimistic for my liking. Right down to when River Phoenix describes an incident where he's caught stealing milk money from school, and his teacher ends up keeping it for herself. There is also a complete lack of positive supporting characters during the scenes set back when they were kids. Only John Cusack, in a cameo role, is shown as a positive older character. No wonder these kids felt so unwanted! All the adults around them were jerks! The script uses more swear words than are actually necessary to convey the anger these kids sometimes feel. And you'd think any dead body that had been hit by a train would be more damaged than the one they find out in the woods. Wouldn't this kid have heard the train coming in time and jumped well out of the way? If he was trying to kill himself, then you'd think he would have stood in the way and been completely pulverized. I know these may seem like petty beefs, but they are enough to knock the review down a star or two.It seems like the film is trying to portray the dead Brower boy as the death of these kids' innocence or something to that effect. As someone who's been their age, I can understand some of what they were feeling. And I totally agree that some of the people you thought were your best friends eventually just turn out to be faces in the crowd at school a few years later.Despite it's faults, this is a powerful film you aren't likely to forget. It's one of Reiner's best, and the outstanding cast does some wonderful work themselves.8 of 10 stars.The Hound."
Stand by Me,08-Jul-99,"I am still a big River Phoenix fan even after his death. This movie I would have to say was his best movie in his earlier roles. All the guys did an awesome job portraying their characters. This movie made me cry, laugh, and rejoice. This movie is just another Rob Reiner masterpiece! I especially love the very last scene where Gordie (Dreyfuss) is finishing his story and he writes about how he has never had friends like he had when he was twelve, and that as anyone? I am only thirteen, and this movies was made the year I was born, but I can still relate to this film so much. I have seen the movie about 12 times, and every time I watch it I understand it more and more. I saw most of the movie when I was about 10 years-old, and the message didn't really sink in then. Now that I am older I can understand the message and relate to it better. The actors really pull you into the movie and script to see what it really was like back then. I know I will refer back to movie time and time again until my dying day. This movie is spectacular!!!!!"
Stand by Me,01-Mar-12,"This film is a brilliant, well-acted masterpiece! What touched me the most was the late River Phoenix's acting, but all of the young actors performances were incredible. They are why you should see this film. 'Stand By Me' is not a bubblegum Disney film, nor a dry Hollywood film; it is a movie that captures childhood in a poignant, non-candy coated manner that is dead on. I saw this movie only a couple months ago and was blown away by it's style and acting. It is rare that you see such fresh, relaxed and deep performances that the actors in this film offered. Although this is not a recent film, it is a genuine, inspiring film that is so refreshing-being so different than the films Hollywood often gives us. I give this film a 100+ and recommend it to everyone. You will benefit from it's message and it's wonderful acting."
Stand by Me,01-Jan-05,"I am as many are, a huge fan of Stephen's King Works. I have also been a fan of many of the films made from his books. Some I am not a fan of. I have not read as of yet and I'm sure I will, The Body. I have seen Stand By Me several times and I am conflicted in many of the great portions of this film and the ideas behind the movie vs the fact that it just doesn't sit with me as entertaining.Stand By Me is considered perhaps one of the forefront coming of age films and for good reason. It's the story of four best friends set in the fifties/sixties told through the eyes of the Gordie Lachance who has lost his role model best friend older brother to an accident. Haunted by the loss of his brother and the fact that everyone seems to have only cared about his older brother including his parents, he is compelled to encourage his group of friends to go on a trek across the county to find the dead body of a missing boy. Unfortunately the ""bad kids"" and ""bullies"" in town also discover that this body is nearby and they race to find it first. During their trek they discover more about each other, and they stand together to overcome their fears about their own lives.I do whole heartedly agree in the pure heart of this film, the coming of age, the different personalities of each boy in the film. It does aim to find a little something of everyone in each boy and it accomplishes that. The cast, especially for young actors is very good. Wil Wheaton as the lead character appears to be weaker than his best friend played by the late River Phoenix but in the end he is really who holds them altogether and overcomes the most of all of them. River Phoenix ironically plays the ""bad boy"" best friend who seems to have very little future but has taken Wheaton's character under his wing and encourages him to make something of himself. Corey Feldman fills in his usual role adequately. Jerry O'Connell as the made fun of ""fat kid"" also plays his role well. Keifer Sutherland who can't help but look like a jerk and an evil fiend also plays well. The cast is basically The Brat Pack and yet for an eighties film it's quite darker than most Brat Pack films. Wholely realistic is the kids' views on life, their fascination with death, cigarettes, adult things, and their adult language. Their trying to be as grown up as possible without any real adult role models.My issue is that the film just doesn't hit me. It never satisfies me or entertains me. I find it entirely too short, very, very, predictable and without any real depth of plot. I know everyone sees this film as a classic and certainly it has it's strong points as I outlined but overall it just falls short for me. The soundtrack, and I absolutely love these songs feels forced like Reiner is trying to force the feeling of the era on us rather than create it all around them. In this case I don't expect anyone to believe my opinion because I am sorely outnumbered but I don't care for this film much at all.5/10"
Stand by Me,27-Mar-06,"The movie Stand by Me is a story about four close twelve year old friends growing up in rural Oregon who are bitten by the curiosity bug. The main Character, Gordie (Wil Wheaton), and his three friends, Chris (River Pheonix), Teddy (Corey Feldman), and Vern (Jerry O'Connell) set out on an adventure to find the body of Ray Brower. They had heard of his whereabouts by Vern's older brother and they were determined to find him. They incur many setbacks during their journey. They are bullied by the older boys of the town who are also trying to find the body and get the fame, attacked by the junkyard dog Chopper, almost getting run down by a train, and attacked by the swamp leaches. The boys learn many lessons on their journey, but more importantly they learn about life. The actual goal of Rob Reiner, director of the film, was to show that growing up has its ups as well as downs. All four of the main characters have had some trouble in their life. He showed this when Gordie's athletic brother was tragically killed in a car accident. By doing this, Reiner elaborates to the audience that bad things do happen to the best people. Chris and Teddy also have very neglecting fathers at their homes. Even though it is all fun and games on the hunt for the body, they still have a troubled life lingering in the background that they can not get away from. And good old Vern has an older brother who wreaks havoc in his life. He is actually one of the older bullies also on the hunt for the body. Reiner cannot make his point much clearer. One of the things I really loved about this movie is how few rules the young twelve year old boys had. The first evident thing is when the movie opens and they are smoking in their tree house. These boys smoke, shoot handguns in town, and cuss like sailors throughout the movie and know one seems to notice. Wow, the times sure have changed since I was a young child."
Stand by Me,15-Feb-12,"i just watched this movie and i have been planning to watch this movie for a long time, this movie is awesome it is moving and just brilliant in every way, i guess the moral of the story is that just cherish every moment you have, had and experiencing because you know we don't live forever. and yes the end made me cry thats just how touching it is, and you know it is true you never find new awesome friends like you did when you was younger. recommend it if you wanna look back at your past and be lost in thought and your future, past and present and just say hey that time was awesome and i wish i could do that again with my old friends :) . . . Krishna c Patel"
Stand by Me,20-Nov-08,"These kinda movies come along very rarely. This is my personal all-time favorite movie. The actors are very talented, especially Wil Wheaton (Gordie) and River Phoenix (Chris) who are my 2 favorite actors. It is based on a Stephen King novella called ""The Body"" and I have read the book and it was fantastic also. The script was put together very well and they done very good on the screen play. All of the actors were very young whenever they shot this and they all showed extreme maturity. I think a lot of people can relate to this movie because it cuts so deep into the heart. I wish that I could have a best friend like Gordie had Chris and Chris had Gordie. Yeah, I have a best friend, but we aren't ""best"" best friends... If you have not seen this movie you need to go out and find it because im sure that this movie will change your life like it did mine."
Stand by Me,24-Aug-05,"I saw this movie a few years ago and I instantly thought it was great. It's a memorable story (adapted from an unusual literary venture for Stephen King) about four 12-year-old boys in 1959 who go in search of a dead body. Everything about this movie was memorable: the script, the acting, and most of all, the four boys. All of them had distinct personalities and backgrounds and didn't blend into each other like so many other movies like this. My favorite character was Chris Chambers, who was not only cute but a ""bad boy"" with a heart of gold (also the breakout role for River Phoenix). This is a must-see for anyone who likes a good movie. The only problem I had with this movie was that I found it unrealistic. The 12-year-old boys in the movies cussed every two words, smoked cigarettes regularly, and talked admiringly in detail about some girl's boobs. I found this unusual even for 1959. I was 12 once, and most of the boys I knew rarely cussed, never smoked anything, and were just a smidge too far from puberty to talk about a girl's boobs in detail. However, these small qualities are redeemed. This is a great movie from the great Stephen King."
Stand by Me,15-Nov-18,"Good story about childhood. Parents, freedom, dreams. And friends. Real friends.
This scenario is simple. After watching the film, there remains a slight aftertaste of losing something important. Something that will never return."
Stand by Me,03-Apr-05,"The most amazing film, truly one of the best i have ever seen, Incredibly funny and the performances from the young boys in the film were just the best i have ever seen in my life. I'm very surprised that they are not as famous as i would of thought they would be to this day. There is a lot of bad language in the film but it just makes it seem more realistic. There were also some tearful moments in it too especially towards the end but i think that just made the movie seem even more special to me. This film has everything, its funny, its adventurous, its tearful and it has a friendship based plot. every time someone asks me what my favourite movie is i always say this one. Don't miss out watch it!"
The Silence of the Lambs,08-Jun-19,"The Silence of the Lambs is a timeless classic, whose more than adequate storytelling never ceases to amaze.The Silence of the Lambs is one of the most entertaining but least fun films to watch all because of its disturbingly genius atmosphere.
It's masterfully acted, especially from Hopkins's side turning this film into a clever and unforgettable masterpiece. Even though Hopkins and Foster don't have much screentime together they still put on a show to remember. Aside from top of the line acting and the directing the script from Ted Tally's (based on the novel by Thomas Harris) is career-defining. From thriller to psychological horror, this movie handles the tone and atmosphere perfectly while switching between the two. In terms of being a psychological horror movie, it does it perfecting as it wraps itself around the viewers' head and proves that gore and blood aren't needed to scare an audience. Surprisingly (and deservedly) this film swooped all five major Oscar categories (Best actor, actress, director, screenplay and picture) even though it was released in February, a whole year before the academy awards.The Silence of the Lambs is a remarkable feat in film making and you be seen by everyone, a film lover or not. Shocking and suspenseful it is a thrill to behold.Final Score: 9/10"
The Silence of the Lambs,19-Feb-99,"Sweeping all five major Academy Awards (""Oscars"" for Best Movie, Director, Actor, Actress, Screenplay) is quite an accomplishment.  Doing it nearly a year after a film was released is a miracle considering the notoriously short attention span of Oscar voters.  It is a powerful example of how great a movie can be when superb writers, directors, actors, and others work at the top of their craft.`Silence of the Lambs' is  the story of a young FBI trainee Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) who is summoned to help find one serial killer called `Buffalo Bill.' by interviewing another.  Foster's performance is absolutely brilliant.  While Anthony Hopkins receives most of the (well-deserved) praise for his chilling portrayal of incarcerated serial killer `Hannibal the Cannibal' Lector', it is Foster's performance that holds the movie together.  The fear she shows just behind her eyes makes Clarice's outward courage all the more interesting and vulnerable.  This is the perfect way to play the part because it explains Lector's interest in Clarice.  Her only bargaining chip in getting Lector's help is to let him `feed' on her innermost secrets and fears in exchange for his brilliant insights into the psychotic mind.  The title of the movie comes from these exchanges and is very poignant.Director Jonathan Demme is masterful.  There is one scene late in the movie that I will not spoil.  It is one of the most simply brilliant scenes ever staged in a movie.  I don't know if all the credit goes to Demme or the writers, but there is a moment in the film where the suspense builds beautifully to a what seems to be a common movie scene.  However, through skillful timing of the direction, the audiences assumptions are used against them and when the truth is revealed (hint: it involves a doorbell) it is shocking and induced a collective gasp from the audience I saw it with at the theatre.  It set the stage for an edge-of-your seat climax.Do not miss this movie.The movie is incredibly suspenseful and an absolute must see."
The Silence of the Lambs,22-Oct-05,"The Silence of the Lambs runs two hours.Anthony Hopkins appears for little more than sixteen minutes, yet during those minutes he hasn't bored you for a second, not even after the tenth or eleventh viewing. Such is the power of his performance, it's absolutely impossible to forget him.His character, Dr.Hannibal""The Cannibal"" Lecter, is a brutal killer with revolting methods and habits, but he's also very intelligent, charismatic and with good taste(you can interpret that as you like).A clichè by now, but who cares? He still is one of the key elements in this wonderful thriller, which sees Jodie Foster's Clarice Starling asking for Lecter's help to catch another killer.The result is a dangerous yet fascinating relationship between the young, unexperienced FBI-agent and the convicted,but basically omnipotent, psychiatrist.He's a step ahead of everyone all the time, and makes sure everyone notices, with his witty, unforgettable one-liners.If there had to be only one reason to worship this movie, then it would have to be the chemistry between the two leading actors.Never before has a non-sexual man/woman connection been more thrilling.Never before has a film's ending been more unsettling and brilliant and left us asking for more.Best watched with a nice Chianti...P.S. dear film-buffs, have the lambs stopped screaming?"
The Silence of the Lambs,21-Jul-00,"Brilliant Best Picture of 1991 that never gets old.  ""The Silence of the Lambs"" deals with a young FBI cadet (Oscar-winner Jodie Foster) who is sent to interview a captured madman (Oscar-winner Anthony Hopkins in one of the greatest performances ever on the screen) to find out about a serial killer (Ted Levine) who is stripping the skin from his female victims after they die.  The FBI has had no luck with the case and agent Scott Glenn tries to throw a curve-ball to Hopkins by sending Foster.  Hopkins is a former doctor of Levine and holds the clues to capturing the unknown criminal.  Needless to say the film takes many twists and turns, creating a suspenseful thriller that has no equal.  At the heart of ""The Silence of the Lambs"" are the confrontations between Hopkins and Foster.  They play a complicated chess match of words which results in some of the greatest footage ever captured for the cinema.  Hopkins dominates in spite of the fact he has approximately 17 minutes of time in the film.  This is a film that will wrap itself around you and you will likely never be able to shake some of the key elements you have seen in this amazing masterpiece.  5 stars out of 5."
The Silence of the Lambs,17-Jan-07,"I'll never forget my first viewing of this movie at the theater and will always look back fondly on it for one reason: helping me quit smoking cigarettes.I read the book first, was fascinated by it, and couldn't wait for the film to come out. That was the day I picked to quit smoking and I knew this movie would take my mind off that matter. I was expecting an intense movie and I got it. Little did I realize how well-received this film would be and how it propelled Anthony Hopkins to super-stardom.Although entertaining, this is not always a fun movie to watch, especially with the scenes with Ted Levine who plays the killer, ""Buffalo Bill."" ""Bill"" and his kidnapped young woman are sick and profane people, respectively, and their scenes are very unpleasant. This movie is not for the squeamish with those and other scenes involving the infamous Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Hopkins). There also is some extreme crudeness in the jail/dungeon where Lecter and other inmates are held.Jodie Foster is excellent as the FBI agent ""Clarice Starling"" and Scott Glenn is low-key and effective as ""Jack Crawford."" A major part of the film is psychological more than violent as Lecter constantly taunts ""Clarice,"" while she tries her best to manipulate him to help with a case. The by-play between the two is a game in itself.Hopkins, however, is the actor people remember best from this movie. His portrayal of the refined-yet-cannibalistic serial killer-doctor is one viewers will never forget. I've enjoyed watching him in the sequels, too. The looks on his face, his fascinating vocabulary with intelligent sarcasm and frankness, never ceases to entertain.""Silence Of The Lambs"" has turned into a modern-day ""classic."" If by some odd chance you have never seen this movie, be warned it is a dark, difficult story to watch at times....but it will get your mind off other things."
The Silence of the Lambs,28-Aug-04,"I've seen way too many thrillers. You name it: ""Identity"", ""Seven"", ""The Usual Suspects"", etc., etc., etc. I remember my friend being so obsessed with ""Silence of the Lambs"", that it drove me crazy. And I hated the movie naturally and refused to see it. But everyone told me that I have to see this, so I let my guard down. And had an open mind, and I'm glad I did. My friend was right, this is a great movie. It is so well acted, I couldn't even describe. I loved ""Silence of the Lambs"" and would recommend it to anyone. It's creepy and exciting. Trust me, you'll love it.10/10"
The Silence of the Lambs,12-Jul-03,This is definitely a film that proves you don't need tons of blood and gore to have a good suspense film.  Anthony Hopkins performance as the deranged genius Lecter earned him a well deserved Academy Award and the same was true of Jodie Foster's performance as Clarice Starling.  This film should go down in history as one of the greatest suspense films in the history of cinema.
The Silence of the Lambs,12-Jan-99,"The Silence of the Lambs, having accomplished the rare feat of winning all five of the major Academy Award categories, is a remarkable achievement in filmmaking.  Gruesome, pulpish material was transformed by dedicated participants on all levels of production, and a film that would have failed in the hands of many others wound up becoming a modern masterpiece.  Taut direction and a superb screenplay might be the best arguments for the film's power, but the flashiest are certainly delivered in the bravura performances of Hopkins and Foster.  Their interplay -- and remember, they only share a handful of scenes together -- is nothing short of riveting."
The Silence of the Lambs,01-Aug-17,"The Silence of the Lambs is a masterpiece you cannot miss, it's a masterwork of suspense that blends the elements of horror, crime and psychology into one tight and smooth story. It's only the third film in history to win Academy Awards in all the top five categories: Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Director, and Adapted Screenplay and that imply something about its technical quality as a film. It features expertise level of craftsmanship in all departments of filmmaking, and takes a huge bonus from the exquisite performances put in by its stellar cast. After all these years The Silence of the Lambs remains in a league of its own and is a perfect exemplification of just how great a movie can become when all the right elements come together and work in perfect harmony to form a complete whole.Based on the novel of the same name, Jodie Foster stars as Clarice Starling, a top student at the FBI's training academy. FBI agent Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) wants Clarice to interview Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), a genius psychiatrist who is also a violent psychopath, serving life behind bars for various acts of murder and cannibalism. Crawford believes that Lecter may have insight into a case of a serial killer called Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine), that murders and skins his victims and that Starling as an attractive young woman, may be just the bait to make him help with the case.The direction by Jonathan Demme is marvelous, as the film introduces its chilling sense of dread and has the audience on the edge of their seats, from the moment Howard Shore's ominous score hits the screen till the end of the film, especially during the climax with a lot of perfectly crafted suspenseful and nail-biting moments. The editing is perfect as the pace is methodical from start to finish, and each and every sequence is relevant to the story. The cinematography by Tak Fujimoto is fantastic as it fully succeeds into creating a very dark and brooding atmosphere that captivates as well as terrorize the audience, while also exhibiting excellent camera work that makes heavy use of close-ups which increase the creepiness and tension along with displaying an optimal color palette and minimal lightning from start to finish, which further enhances the darker ambience the story was aiming for. Moreover, the production design team has done a magnificent work as every set piece is meticulously crafted, richly detailed and very well-lit. The script by Ted Tally, also packs a very well structured and tight plot, every character has a well-defined arc, all the themes are smartly addressed, the attention to detail is quite impressive, and the complete story and narrative are perfect.The performances are incredible. Jodie Foster as Clarice is absolutely brilliant and gives an impeccable performance as a woman who is desperately trying to forget her painful past and yet at the same time tries to prove her worth in a male dominant world. Anthony Hopkins as the genius psychiatrist and cannibalistic serial killer Hannibal Lecter is the perfect amalgamation of charisma, high intelligence and destructive violence, and gives a bone-chilling and memorable performance that will stand the passage of time as one of the absolute best. The small amount of screen time that Hopkins is given is a definitive testament to his acting capabilities, as with such an elegant and minimal performance, he solidifies himself as one of the most iconic villains of all time. Due to the charisma and electrifying chemistry between the two actors every scene they share becomes an instant classic.In conclusion, the Silence of the Lambs is one of the greatest films ever made and a masterwork of brilliant direction, smart screenplay, splendid camerawork, tight editing, marvelous score and exquisite performances, that cemented the legacy of both Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster by engraving their iconic characters into the annals of cinema. The film absolutely deserves all the accolades and recognition it gets, for both its contributions to cinema and the immense impact it had on pop culture. Jonathan Demme's magnum opus is an outstanding achievement in genre filmmaking that has inspired and influenced countless thrillers since its release, and is not only the quintessential suspense and psychological horror film but also an ingenious observation of humanity's dark and violent nature and a masterpiece that every film lover must see."
The Silence of the Lambs,11-Aug-06,"It is a creepy and taken-by-storm experience with the film, background music is darker than the film itself and too ominous, plot is brilliantly constructed, conversations are thought-provocative, to crown the whole, Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkin are the cream. They take ownership of Clarice and Hannibal respectively, transforming them into the most unforgettable screen images.The psychological path of Hannibal is hard to trace. He is so odd a mixture of intelligence, cruelty, insanity, grace and charisma. In the depth, fledgling FBI trainee Clarice is no match of him. She is still naive yet very ambitious. On the trail of the serial killer Buffalo Bill, she's sent to interview him, a psychiatrist-turned-cannibal. Hannibal is willing to provide clues to finding the killer but only in return for personal information about Clarice herself. He calls it Quid Pro Quo. In those mind games, the two dance backward and forward between cannibal and FBI agent, mentor and student, psychiatrist and patient, father and daughter. It is Clarice who breathes life into the multidimensional sophisticated psychopath and Hannibal who nudges the aspiring student FBI agent and helps her achieve her first success in a world of Y chromosome where her guru Crawford uses her, embarrasses her, excludes her; Doctor Chilton regards her no more than a simple-minded woman and tries to flirt with her. Frankly speaking, though no lack of other impressive scenes, it's really the nerves fights between Hannibal and Clarice that carries the film.Some of the horrible scenes involve Buffalo Bill who, a transvestite, skins his victims, especially woman victims. But the most terrifying one is Clarice's single-handed trace in Buffalo Bill's gruesome den, which also has become another irony to the self-important testosterone-dominated world. Crawford's misjudgment and stubbornness makes him out of the right track, a special anti-terror deployment resulting in vain. But Clarice, though excluded from the business which she should be on, still holds onto her intuition and through on-the-spot investigation finds the serial killer at last. She has to take on him herself. (Demme uses ""deceptive cutting"" there to enhance the tension.) It is definitely a life-or-death fight, especially when Clarice is in the dark, groping her way in absolute terror. I have no doubt everyone holds the breath when the film rolls to that part.A gripping film that well deserved its Oscars"
The Silence of the Lambs,04-Jun-20,"I absolutely loved The Silence of the Lambs. Everything about this film was perfect. It starred Jodie Foster as Clarice Starling, a student at the FBI's training academy, assigned by agent Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) to interview Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), a former psychiatrist and cannibalistic serial killer to see if Lecter can help them solve the Buffalo Bill (Ted Irvine) murders and tell them who is behind it.First off I'll say that the acting in this was phenomenal. Anthony Hopkins put on one of the best performances I've ever seen and to think he's only in it for a total of 16 minutes! He really got into the craziness of Hannibal Lecter with his lines, delivery of them and emotions. Hannibal Lecter is for sure one of the most interesting characters of all time. Jodie Foster was excellent too, as I liked Clarice. She was really someone who you could get behind and root for. I liked how much she developed into a smart FBI agent. It was intriguing to see Foster in a more normal role considering I watched Taxi Driver recently and whom she played was VERY DIFFERENT from Clarice. There's no doubt that Hopkins and Foster deserved to win the Oscars that year for best actor and best actress. Ted Irvine, who played the Buffalo Bill was also great as he did a good job of making the Buffalo Bill such a creepy person.The cinematography was great and there were some nice camera angles. I especially liked the POV shots. Lots of great suspense in this such as when Lecter escaped from his cell, and they had the cops, swat team and medics looking for him and when Clarice chased the Buffalo Bill around his house. Those were my favorite parts. I was on the edge of my seat during the house chase. I loved the ending as it was a great way to leave things opened and a nice way for us to know where Lecter is.Overall, I'll rate The Silence of the Lambs a 10/10. Incredible film, that rightfully deserved to win the five main Oscars that year."
The Silence of the Lambs,16-Nov-05,"STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits Rookie FBI agent Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) is assigned to get into the mind of notorious incarcerated serial killer Dr Hannibal 'the Cannibal' Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) to get his evaluation on the elusive Buffalo Bill, a serial killer who's been abducting and killing young women. When a prominent senator's daughter is kidnapped, it becomes a race against time to find her before she is killed and all the while Lecter is playing mind-games with Starling as well as any help he can provide...The first of Thomas Harris's Hannibal novels to be adapted for the screen, only to be followed some years later with some very lacklustre (but inevitable!) follow-ups, despite it's age this remains one of the most effective chillers of modern times. Despite the mainstream appeal of the film, the grainy lighting and laid-back budget give it an art-house feel that sets it apart from other such films that were as successful. The film manages some effectively disturbing scenes that make it a not altogether pleasant viewing experience.Performances wise, in a very early role, a young Foster shows her promise for future roles, with a gripping portrayal of naivety and vulnerability here that is very compelling and convincing, even though there are some plausibility problems with someone as junior as her being assigned to do something like that. Hopkins too is brilliant as Lecter, playing a dangerous man behind bars who's ability to get inside your head and see the things you don't want him to see makes him no less dangerous, if not more so, than if he was on the outside. He's certainly received the most acclaim for his role over the years, but in my humble opinion, he's actually over-shadowed (though only slightly!) by Ted Levine as Buffalo Bill, a truly extraordinary psychopath with an unsettling sexuality disorder that is probably one of the nastiest things ever to be seen in such a mainstream film. As supporting FBI agent Crawford, Scott Glenn is impressive but sort of just faded into DTV land after this film.It's easily one of the most popular films ever made, so it's likely a lot of you are familiar with it already, but with reviews on the so-inferior follow-up films Red Dragon and Hannibal, I thought it only right that I'd finally give this first film a mention. Truly remarkable. *****"
The Silence of the Lambs,19-Jun-00,"With Silence of the Lambs comes some much needed recognition for the horror genre.  It is a first-rate production all around.  It boasts a witty and suspenseful script based on the Thomas Harris novel, full of great lines. It has marvelous direction from Demme.  Demme creates suspense very well throughout and uses some great directorial shots such as the twin frames of Clarice ringing a doorbell and the FBI men breaking into a home.  The two lead actors won oscars for their performances...each deserved.  Foster is very good in her role, but it is Anthony Hopkins that literally lights up the screen with his complex portrayal of a complex serial killer.  Hopkins does the seemingly impossible. He frightens you with his outrageousness and yet illicts some pity/compassion(albeit not a lot) for his situation.  He says his lines with reservedness when needed and brashness when needed.  The rest of the cast is also quite good with Anthony Heald a standout as a unethical, petty doctor in charge of Hopkins.  Of course the story of the other killer is very very chilling as well.  A quality film in all aspects!"
The Silence of the Lambs,10-Aug-19,"I just saw, for the second or third time, this cinematographic masterpiece, during an « UGC culte » evening, in Paris. The list of the Big Five Academy Award winners is short. There are currently three of them, in nine decades: It Happened One Night (1934), One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975) and ... The Silence of the Lambs (1991). This is not really surprising, this film being excellent, endowed with a script skillfully elaborated by Thomas Harris, with an irreproachable casting including Anthony Hopkins, Jodie Foster and Scott Glenn. In addition, the director Jonathan Demme delivers a work obviously enjoying an admirable preparatory work.Without unduly spoiling the script, if you have not seen it yet, by the greatest fluke: a psychopath known as the Buffalo Bill sows terror in the Middle West by kidnapping and murdering young pulpy women, after partially or completely skinning them. Clarice Starling, a young FBI agent, is in charge of interviewing Hannibal Lecter, a well-known former psychiatrist who has also the characteristic of a truly intelligent psychopath focused on cannibalism. Hannibal Lecter is able to provide Clarice Starling with providential information about Buffalo Bill . But he agrees to help her only in exchange for information about the young woman's private life. Between them is established a link of fascination and repulsion.As a synthesis: a thrilling must see. 9/10 of 10"
The Silence of the Lambs,22-Jan-99,"""Silence of the Lambs"" is one of those movies a person could watch over and over again and never get bored.  The mixture of acting, screenplay, and direction make it one of the jewels of American cinema."
The Silence of the Lambs,17-Jul-05,"There is little doubt that the most memorable aspect of The Silence of the Lambs is Anthony Hopkins' incomparable performance as Lecter. Taking over for Brian Cox, who was effective, but not especially memorable, as the good doctor in 1986's Manhunter, Hopkins instantly makes the role his own, capturing and conveying the charismatic essence of pure evil. To his dying day, no matter how many roles he plays in the interim, Hopkins will forever be known for this part. (It is a credit to Hopkins' ability as an actor that this part did not result in stereotyping. His post-Silence career has been greatly varied, with roles as widely diverse as a stodgy butler in Merchant-Ivory's The Remains of the Day and an action hero in The Edge.) I can throw out any number of superlatives, but none of them do justice to this chilling performance, which I labeled as the best acting work of the '90s. Want to feel the icy fingers of terror stroke your heart? Watch this mixture of brilliant eloquence and inhuman cruelty. As portrayed by Hopkins, Hannibal is both a suave, cultured gentleman and an unspeakable fiend. He is gracious and monstrous at the same time. (Hopkins also provided one of the most quotable lines in recent film history with ""I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice Chianti"", which was followed by an inimitable slithering slurp.)"
The Silence of the Lambs,25-May-16,"The Silence of the Lambs (1991) is a classic psychological suspense brilliant masterpiece well acted and the best thriller ever made! This was my first film I saw on VHS as a teenager and I absolutely loved it. Right after seeing this flick, I heard about Hannibal (2001) Ridley Scot film a sequel to this psychological thriller flick, I rushed buying it right away. Saddly I was disappointed with Ridley Scott Hannibal.""Silence of the Lambs "" is a classic and I think people would agree. It is my number 1 favorite thriller ever made, mostly I have enjoyed Jodie Foster as FBI recruit Clarice Starling's. Jodie did a brilliant acting performance I have seen. I love this film to death I absolutely love everything about this film. Since the first time I saw her in Silence I went to seeing her in a movie theater 2002 Panic Room, it was her first film I saw in movie theater since than I love Jodie Foster but Silence will be her best film she ever made. I was disappointed with the sequel Hannibal, no Jodie Foster in it, no brilliant masterful Clarice. Julianne Moore was incompetent for me, she couldn't catch Hannibal. Clarice Starling character was based on Gillian Anderson's FBI Agent Dana Scully and I think The X-Files inspired this film. I am even convinced that The Lone Gunman three geeks were also based on this film. You have a nice shootout on the end with Clarice and Buffalo Bill and Clarice get's her man, spoils her plans saves the hostage and saves the day.The Silence of the Lambs is the 1991 thriller that was the feature film adaptation of the novel of the same name by Thomas Harris and marked the first appearance of Anthony Hopkins as Dr. Hannibal Lecter. (Oscar-winner Anthony Hopkins in one of the greatest performances ever on the screen) Dr.Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lecter, is a brutal killer with revolting methods and habits, but he's also very intelligent, charismatic and with good taste (you can interpret that as you like). He is scary and his the same time awesome including brilliant, you can't out smart him. Director Jonathan Demme is masterful directing this flick you have to be brilliant you have to keep thinking to solve the murder mystery. Scott Glenn acts beautiful as Jack Crawford. This flick got five major Academy Awards (""Oscars"" for Best Movie, Director, Actor, Actress, Screenplay) it is no wonder why.Plot: FBI recruit Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) is asked by the Bureau to elicit Lecter's help in tracking down a notorious serial killer who has kidnapped a US Senator's daughter. Directed by Jonathan Demme (The Manchurian Candidate), the film would receive five Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Actor for Hopkins and Best Actress for Foster and Best Screenplay. Hopkins would reprise his role as Lecter in two more films: Hannibal (2001) and Red Dragon (2002).Real life killer Ed Gein was the inspiration for Buffalo Bill as well as the inspiration for Norman Bates from Psycho and Leatherface from the Texas Chainsaw Massacre movies. And the director Jonathan Demme was a film student of Roger Corman who makes a cameo in the movie. Roger Corman taught not only him, but I think other filmmakers such as Martin Scorsese, James Cameron, Joe Dante, Francis Ford Coppola, and many others. Ted Levine did a pretty solid job as a serial killer Buffalo Bill. This film is fun, intense, very well fast paced goes quickly around for those two hours.The Silence of the Lambs is a 1991 American horror-thriller film directed by Jonathan Demme and starring Jodie Foster, Anthony Hopkins, and Scott Glenn. The film is based on Thomas Harris' 1988 novel of the same name, his second to feature Hannibal Lecter, a brilliant psychiatrist and cannibalistic serial killer. In the film, Clarice Starling, a young U.S. FBI trainee, seeks the advice of the imprisoned Dr. Lecter to apprehend another serial killer, known only as ""Buffalo Bill"".This movie is a perfect 10 out of 10, it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth (Jonathan Demme) with a brilliant cast including Thomas Harris novel that was adapted from it. I even saw the Documentary how they were shooting this film on YouTube. I think I do have that documentary film in my Blu-ray special features. Watch this film you want be disappointed at all. The movie is incredibly suspenseful and an absolute must see for fans."
The Silence of the Lambs,22-Feb-16,"Silence of the Lambs (1991) follows the story of the young and ambitious Clarice Starling in her attempt to apprehend the serial killer named ""Buffalo Bill"" (Ted Levine). Starling goes to the infamous Hannibal Lecter (nicknamed Hannibal the Cannibal for his exotic tastes). Clarice relies on Lecter for his expertise and knowledge about the mind of a serial killer. Whereas Hannibal toys with Clarice in order to amuse himself. Clarice and her fellow agents are forced to rely on the help of a killer in order to catch another.Jodie Foster does an excellent job playing the young and eager Clarice. She portrays her Southern accent as often painfully obvious, which Lecter pounces upon as an insecurity. Foster speaks with a wavering voice at times, showing Clarice's inexperience and disgust with the crimes committed by Buffalo Bill. Hopkins is completely absorbed into the role of Hannibal Lecter. To create his creepy and psychotic persona he stares unblinkingly, forcing both the audience and Clarice to return his cold gaze. Hopkins keeps as still as possible while acting, looking like a snake poised to pounce upon less intelligent prey, and in comparison to Lecter everyone is less intelligent, and is therefore potential prey. Hopkins keeps a soft smirk on his lips throughout the film as if to say he knows something no one else does. The film's soundtrack is absolutely haunting and mysterious. It works well with the film to create tension and anxiety in the audience. However, the director (Jonathan Demme) knows when silence is just as powerful. In a tense scene in complete darkness we are left with no sound save for the heavy breathing of Buffalo Bill. The cinematography is excellent for this film. The colors of the film are gray and lifeless, which complement the film's dark subject matter. At pivotal moments the camera angle switches to first person. This view works perfectly when Clarice rounds the corner and sees Lecter for the first time. We are able to truly appreciate Lecter's piercing gaze, because we see it first hand through Clarice's eyes. The performances of Hopkins and Foster would have been flat if it were not for the well written script. The small anecdotal stories about Lecter help to build his character even before we meet him. Lecter's lines are meant to sound sophisticated and cultured in order to create his paradoxical character as a gentleman-psychopath. Buffalo Bill refers to his victims as ""it"" in an attempt to destroy their humanity in another example of brilliant writing. A key strength in this film is its character development. Not just Lecter or Clarice's development, but their relationship itself. The audience watches as Lecter and Clarice grow closer and closer in a bizarre exchange not unlike two friends sharing secrets. As Clarice learns more from Lecter, so too does Lecter learn more about Clarice. The audience can see that Lecter values this relationship because he does not hunt her down for as Clarice puts it, ""He would consider that rude"". Silence of the Lambs is a gripping and disturbing film, filled with fascinating characters. It remains a timeless horror film that draws from the darkest and foulest corner of humanity's existence. It is a terrifying movie because it reminds us that the monsters in our world are not imaginary, but could pass us on the street any day."
The Silence of the Lambs,20-Mar-99,"Great job by Foster and Hopkins.  Hannibal's part could have been fleshed out a little more, though (sorry, couldn't resist that one).  The book described him in more detail and made him even more reprehensible; the movie could have spent five minutes more and done the same."
The Silence of the Lambs,30-Oct-05,"It's impossible to comment on SILENCE OF THE LAMBS as being a mere film . Its release was a watershed in popular culture and has influenced a myriad of imitations that are far too numerous to mention . Much of this success is down to director Jonathan Demme who has made the film so effective by coming up with the strikingly simple idea of filming everything in dim lighting which gives SILENCE a moody and brooding atmosphere that was absent from movies in the previous decade . Ironically enough this is as typical of 90s film making as MANHUNTER was of 80s movies . Howard Shore's score also helps the proceedings and Jodie Foster gives a sublime nuanced performance as vulnerable heroine Clarice Starling . Watch the scenes closely when Clarice is in the company of men , don't you get the feeling she has a phobia about the male of the species . Is she a victim of sexual abuse in her childhood ? A lesbian ? We never find out but Foster's performance is multi layered and it's a pity this aspect is never explored in HANNIBAL which sadly deletes this aspect to Clarice Sadly SILENCE was released with a tidal wave of hype which the film doesn't live up to . Who can forget the stories that upon seeing this at the cinema certain audience members wanted armed escorts back to their cars ! I'm sorry but despite being a good thriller it's not that good and I fail to see how people were turned into quivering jellies unable to sleep with the lights off . I'm also afraid to say that much of the awards heaped upon the film aren't that well deserved either . Foster deserved the Oscar as did the film and possibly Demme too but did Ted Tally for his adapted screenplay ? All he seems to have done is to copy the best bits of Harris's novel wholesale into the screenplay without making an effort to improve anything . and i'll probably be accused of sacrilege but the more times I see this film the more times I ask myself how did Hopkins win the Oscar for Best Actor ? I don't even think Hopkins should have qualified for the Best Actor category since the role isn't on screen long enough and his performance is slightly hammy . Hannibal as played by Hopkins resembles something along the lines of a paedophile rather than a serial killer who has maimed , murdered and munched on adults . Despite having some reservations of Brian Cox as Hannibal in MANHUNTER you do believe his burly presence does have the physical strength to overpower his victims , not so Hopkins I know it's very difficult , perhaps even impossible , but the best way to enjoy this movie is to erase from your mind the fact that it's one of only three movies to have picked up the Oscar in all five main categories , the fact that it made headlines about being the most terrifying film committed to celluloid , and the fact that it stands as the 28th best movie ever on this website . It is a very good thriller but one that is ultimately disappointing after hearing of the hype surrounding it"
The Silence of the Lambs,26-Dec-19,"Silence of the lambs offers one of the most controversial and fascinating stories in the history of cinema. A picture that for the entire duration is a mixture of comedy / theatrical tragedy and a cult film (which it later became). We witness the whole story, frame to frame, step by step from a glorious balcony of a theatre stage made of wood and blood, with spotlights focused on some of the greatest actors in history and of that time. Unprecedented direction, incessant rhythm that keeps glued to the armchair, almost as if Dr. Hannibal had chained us all himself."
The Silence of the Lambs,17-Mar-09,"It is really difficult for me to understand what it is about this film that everyone loves. I have seen many thrillers and I can honestly say that this one is not even in my Top 20. Although I think Hopkins did a terrific job in Lecter's shoes, his 30 minutes on screen just were not enough. This was supposed to be a horror film but I think it barely managed to create the suspense atmosphere and it certainly did not scare me or made me feel uncomfortable at all. Perhaps I expected more since I have been hearing all the fuzz about this movie since I was a little kid. So I watched this film several times and I am still not enjoying it that much."
The Silence of the Lambs,20-Aug-19,"This movie has great directing, alright cinematography, amazing acting, solid plotline, brilliant writing, well-crafted characters, and average soundtrack. Although it was wasn't my cup of tea, this thriller movie is enjoyable from beginning to end even if you're not into those type. It is a slow-paced film but it gets intense after a while so patience is key and the acting in this movie made it far more interesting, especially Anthony Hopkins' and Jodie Foster's. Personally, a 7/10 but could be an 8 the next time I watch it again."
The Silence of the Lambs,27-Oct-05,"Agent Clarice Starling is a training FBI agent, hope to work in behavioral sciences with Jack Crawford. Crawford though sends Starling on an assignment, to psychologically exam the insanely intelligent criminal Hannibal Lecter. Crawford had another agenda, to see if Starling can press information out of Lecter to help with the current case of Buffalo Bill. Bill has already killed five girls, skinning off sections of their bodies. Lecter is intrigue by Starling and helps her with the investigation; they start to form a strange friendship.The Silence of the Lambs is one of the best psychological thrillers. Thomas Harris's best selling book is faithfully transfered to the screen. It's one dark twisted disturbing ride. The mood is heighten by Demme's great direction, with such detail in all the sets and locations. Demme has used reflective surfaces wonderfully, during one of Starling's and Lecter's talks it used to great extent. One of the final sequences of Clarice walking through the basement of Bill's house is one of the most suspense full scenes i have ever seen.All the performances are knock outs. Jodie Foster as always brings the goods and makes Starling the most interesting to watch. At times she makes Starling so fragile, then a second later she's strong as steel. Anthony Hopkins is so disturbing as Lecter. From the first second you see Lecter standing in his cell; just waiting for Starling to show, you can see Hopkins was perfect casting. You cant keep your eyes off Lecter, he's so disturbing and can make your skin crawl every time he speaks. Ted Levine makes the perfect serial killer, you can see from Levine's performance what a torn and damaged soul the killer is; you feel somewhat sympathetic for him.The Silence of the Lambs is a must see, one of the best thrillers you'll ever see."
The Silence of the Lambs,29-Oct-16,"This review contains spoilers, for a spoiler-free version of what I think of this movie, please read the conclusion only. The idea? Pretty good. The acting performances? Definetively great. But, *SPOILER ALERT* am I supposed to ignore that all of a sudden everybody changes their mind about having Lecter under maximum security at the moment he escapes? Hannibal Lecter's escape is one of the most ridiculously unrealistic and stupid things that I've ever seen in a movie as acclaimed as this one. Let's ignore all the stupid things that happen after he kills the two cops and let's just focus on the situation that makes everything ""possible"", in the first place. Just two cops were watching over Lecter. No camera camera surveillance, they didn't even have a radio to immediately inform the rest of the officers if something goes wrong, that or, for some reason, they didn't used such radio when things eventually went wrong. The rest of the officers, ten or more, were just hanging out in the lobby of the building. That's already very stupid and inconsistent with the way the authorities had been treating Lecter all the rest of the movie until that point. But things get even more ridiculous, both officers, totally unconcerned, enter the cell at the same time to give Lecter his meal. The following sequence is so immensely stupid I can't express it correctly with words. If you are of the popular opinion that this movie is one of the greatest thrillers of all time, please, re-watch this scene. After Lecter easily opens his handcuffs with a pen, he proceeds handcuff one of the officers and attack the other with a very effective attack (please note the sarcasm), he bites his face. Yeah, no way to defend against that, especially if you are an armed and trained police officer. The rest of the escape, including the idea of ripping off one of the officer's face and using it as a mask, is, again, immensely stupid, and would obviously never work in real life. This movie is full of ridiculous plot holes that insult the intelligence of the viewer and everything regarding Lecter's escape is beyond stupid and unrealistic. CONCLUSION (spoiler free): Great performances by the leading actors, well directed, and plenty of good, high-tension, entertaining scenes, but if you care about plot consistency and you need this type of films to have a minimum level of realism, this movie isn't for you, and it certainly wasn't for me. 4/10 not worth it. Thanks for reading and sorry for bad English."
Jojo Rabbit,05-Nov-19,"This film was exceptional and one of the best I've seen this year. Watiti has great comedic vision and the cast is phenomenal. Jojo Rabbit was wierd , funny , heartwarming and heartbreaking and I think its definitely worth the watch."
Jojo Rabbit,03-Nov-19,"The trailer for the movie had me scratching my head but as a HUGE fan of Waititi I felt I ought to give it a shot.My best spoiler free review is that this is an original, outrageous film. The emotional gamut we are subjected to is whiplash inducing, but without the neck brace and ambulance chasing lawyers.Every actor is perfection. Young JoJo and Yorkie are devastatingly earnest and so talented. Sam Rockwell is always a master. Every subtle satire is underwritten with a grim level of truth. The soundtrack n unexpected choice.Go see it. Prepare yourself for quite a ride."
Jojo Rabbit,25-Dec-19,For me this film is a total paradox. I have never laughed so hard in one scene and then cried like a baby in the next. It's unique. Go watch.
Jojo Rabbit,02-Nov-19,"So good. Taika makes you experience joy, terror, love, hate all in one minute and then he jumps out and runs around in a Hitler costume.It's historically accurate too showing the polarisation of Germany during war time, indoctrination into the hitler youth and the storming of Berlin.100% would watch again."
Jojo Rabbit,01-Nov-19,"Greetings again from the darkness. Welcome to the most divisive movie of the year. Some will scoff at the idea and deride the filmmaker without ever even seeing the movie. Some will relay disgust after seeing the movie. A few won't appreciate the style or structure, and will fail to find the humor. Ah yes, but some of us will embrace Taika Waititi's wacky adaptation of Christine Leunens' 2018 novel ""Caging Skies"" as one of the funniest and most heart-warming films of the year ... fully acknowledging that many won't see it our way.One wouldn't be off base in asking why a successful filmmaker would tackle such a risky project: a coming-of-age comedy-drama-fantasy about a 10 year old Nazi fanatic who has as his imaginary friend, not a 6 foot rabbit, but the Fuhrer himself, Adolph Hitler. After all, writer-director Waititi is coming off a couple of brilliant indies (2014's WHAT WE DO IN THE SHADOWS, and 2016's HUNT FOR THE WILDERPEOPLE) and a major score with Marvel money on THOR: RAGNAROK (2017), arguably the most entertaining superhero movie of the past few years. He certainly could have continued to cash in with 'safer' choices; however, Mr. Waititi sees the world differently than most of us. He finds humor in the drudgery, and humanity in malevolence. He's also a bit goofy.Playing over the opening credits is the German version of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"", as we see old clips of German citizens cheering for Adolph Hitler in a similar manner to how fans used to scream for The Beatles. World War II is nearing the end as we meet 10 year old Jojo Betzler (newcomer Roman Griffin Davis). Jojo is fervent in his fanaticism towards the Nazi way, and buys into the belief that Jews are monsters with horns on their head. He's such a believer that his imaginary friend is actually Hitler, well at least a bumbling boisterous version played by the filmmaker himself - enacted to extreme comedy effect (recalling a bit of Chaplin in THE GREAT DICTATOR). Mel Brooks managed to play Hitler to a laughable extreme in ""Springtime for Hitler"" in THE PRODUCERS, but the only thing missing her from Waititi's costume is an old timey dunce cap.Jojo lives at home with his mother Rosie (Scarlett Johansson), while dad is off fighting on the front line. Ms. Johansson's performance is terrific (despite limited screen time) as she creates a believably warm bond with her son during horrific times. Soon, Jojo is off to a Nazi camp designed to teach the boys how to fight (and burn books), as the girls learn the virtues of having babies. The camp leaders are Captain Klenzendorf (Sam Rockwell), who is a bit of a joke on the surface, but more interesting the deeper we dig; Fraulein Rahm (Rebel Wilson) who boasts of having 18 Aryan babies; and Finkel (Alfie Allen) a violent psychopath. At camp with Jojo is his best friend Yorki (newcomer and scene-stealer Archie Yates), and the two show what a genuine friendship can be as the movie progresses.Things change quickly for Jojo when, by happenstance, he discovers a Jewish girl living in the walls of his home. Elsa (Thomasin McKenzie, LEAVE NO TRACE) shows none of the characteristics that Jojo has been brainwashed into believing all Jews possess. She has no horns, flashes a good sense of humor, and is actually very nice and knowledgeable. In other words, she's no monster. As they get to know each other, Jojo realizes this ""nice"" Jewish girl contrasts starkly with his lunatic hero Adolph.Waititi's film is ingenious satire, and it likely won't sit well with those who think not enough time has passed to justify making fun of Nazi atrocities. It's funny and heavy, and deals with some thought-provoking matter in an unusual way. The ""Heil Hitler"" count approaches the 'F-word' frequency of most Tarantino movies, and there is a German Shepherd gag that caught the audience off-guard. Stephen Merchant's Gestapo search of Jojo's house is comedy at its weirdest. The movie messes with your head as it's some odd blend of SCHINDLER'S LIST, ""The Diary of Anne Frank"", and an extended Monty Python skit.It's rare for a film that borders on slapstick at times to have so many touching and emotional moments. The actors are really strong here, especially Ms. Johansson and Ms. McKenzie, who as gutsy Elsa, proves again she is quickly becoming a powerhouse young actor. Roman Griffin Davis carries a significant weight in the story despite being a first time actor, and I can't emphasize enough how young Archie Yates will steal your heart while he's stealing his scenes. Michael Giacchino's score and Mihai Malaimaire Jr's terrific cinematography work well with Waititi's vision ... a satirical vision that would never work outside of his unique filmmaking talent. The story is basically proof of the adage, 'Kill 'em with kindness', when what we are really killing is hatred. At its core, this is a story of humanity and human nature, and how we grab hold of the wrong thing until the truth becomes evident. Now, please pass the unicorn."
Jojo Rabbit,09-Sep-19,"This was another of Taika at his best. Taking him back to his bittersweet indie roots, his storytelling and humanity shows through at every moment. A story of a 10 year old nazi youth in full swing of his country's ideology indoctrination, he starts his journey with his invisible best friend Adolf Hitler (Taika Waititi himself) going off to Hitler Youth camp. His mother is a wild and endearing woman with a playful attitude during this horrible time of war. The movie starts off hilariously, but it takes a little bit of time to allow yourself to feel okay laughing at this side of the german war and this little boy who wants nothing more than to do right by his fuhrer. After a terrible (and hilariously acted) accident, and the discovery that his mother is hiding a young Jewish girl in their attic, his ideals are turned upside down to the thoughts on the war he has grown up with. It's a simple message delivered in a way that tells you what you already know. Facism is bad. It's a story that Taika tells us needs to be told over and over again, because people easily turn a blind eye to the horrors of humankind, but heart and love can prevail. Roman Griffin Davis and Thomasin McKenzie are a great pair and carry the film with warmth and wonderful comedic scenes, but it's Scarlett Johansson who leaves us with the memory of what it means to be on the right side of humanity, and to take life as it comes and teach your children what you can, when you can. Even surrounded by well-known and substantial actors, these two children stand out and bring the movie's warm embrace. Taika is never afraid to lead with a joke, but he always takes the time to bring his message of humanity home by hanging on the sad moments of life too, not jumping over life's tragedies to get to the next one-liner. He balances the good with the bad perfectly, leaving you walking away with a warm feeling in your belly."
Jojo Rabbit,06-Nov-19,"Just watch it and see for yourself. My opinion, it was hilarious and heartfelt. The acting was superb. The story was thought provoking. It was funny at times and heartbreaking at times. I'm a huge fan of What We Do in the Shadows and I am huge fan of JoJo Rabbit. Go support this film in the theatre so more films like this can be made. I can't wait to see what Taika Waititi does next🙏🏻
P.S
I'm a Jew"
Jojo Rabbit,18-Sep-19,"Probably one of the most controversial films to come out of TIFF, I went into Jojo Rabbit with cautionious optimism since I am fan of Taika Waititi while still being aware of the divineness it has spawned in some critics. I was pleasantly surprised on how emotional and thought provoking he made this film while still being very funny without going too far.Jojo is a 10-year old boy who dreams of fighting for his country and making his hero proud. And that hero just so happens to be Adolf Hitler during the final year of WW2. Jojo's blind fanaticism is so extreme he imagines Adolf as his best friend to give him advice, which to no surprise, is not that helpful. After an accident at the Hitler Youth camp, Jojo has to stay with his mother only to discover she is hiding Elsa, a teenage girl who is the very thing his Nazis beliefs have told him to fear and hate: a Jew. As Jojo tries to learn about Elsa's ""kind"", he begins to sees Elsa as the thoughtful yet scared person she really is and not the monster his beliefs have told her to be.The smartest thing I can say is Waitia knows when to make a joke about Nazi's beliefs and ideals but then let the bleakness of WW2 set in to embrace the deeper themes and emotions. Within the first act, Jojo sees his world through rose-tinted glasses as he gleefully gives the Nazi salute to his fellow neighbours on a bright sunny day. All of the Nazi characters are heightened and exaggerated for comic relief from Sam Rockwell's Captain Klenzendorf being a tired and annoyed German soldier, Rebel Wilson as the ignorant Fraulein Rahm to Stephen Merchant as the Gestapo agent Deertz. Waititi takes pleasure in making Nazis the but of the joke from showing them being over-committed to saluting each other for just a simple introduction to their obliviousness of believing any stupid fake news they are told came from Hilter himself.
Once Jojo settles with Elsa sharing his house, his world begins show its true ugliness as Germany becomes more desperate to hold their ground against the Allied forces. At that point Waititi slows down on the comedy and allows moments of shock and drama to settle in to remind the audience what is the horrible cost of ignorance and blind faith. Cinematographer Mihai Malaimare Jr. switches the color scheme from bright and saturated to cold and grey as the seasons pass to reflect the change in Jojo's state of mind. The parallels to the modern day become very clear without getting too blunt.The cast plays each of their roles perfectly. Roman Griffin Davis carries the story as a naïve but yet innocence Jojo. Davis is perfectly cast with perfect comedic timing while still being able to sell the emotional beats that are needed. And he has great comedic and emotional chemistry with Thomasin McKenzie as Elsa. McKenzie displays the hardship her character has gone throughout her life and yet still making her fun and sharp-witted when she points out shallowness of Jojo's ideals. Also who is worth mentioning is Scarlett Johansson as Jojo's mother Rosie. Probably the best performance of Johansson I have seen so far, she brings a huge feeling of joy and optimism that is needed to help Jojo's growth as a character. Out of all of the adults that are blind to the horrors the Axis power is inflicting upon the world, Rosie is the only one that is able to see through it and confront it. As for the big question of Waititi himself playing a young boy's interpretation of Adolf Hitler, he handles it very well. His comedic performance is there to show the absurdity of Jojo's brainwashing from the Nazis's teaching. And it helps that he never to tries to humanize the portrayal of his character. There were even a few moments where he becomes a bit more antagonistic towards Jojo as he begins doubting the faith in his idol.Jojo Rabbit may be a controversial pick if it does get nominated for awards consideration (after I saw it on the last day of TIFF, it surprisingly won the People's Choice Award), but I feel like it is a movie needed for today's political issues. Taika Waititi uses the story of a boy's misguided fantasy and faith to show how easy it is for society to be manipulated into hating minorities, religions and/or groups of people especially when fake news and social media is present. But by the end of the day he shows that compassion and love are still worth embracing in a cruel world so as long as we are able to confront to cruelty in ourselves first."
Jojo Rabbit,29-Oct-19,"As a German, I loved everything about this movie. Absurdity from these times is captured amazingly, and now, almost a century afterwards, we can take it with some humor. Well done, I hope this movie goes on to win some awards."
Jojo Rabbit,29-Feb-20,"Jojo Rabbit demonstrates that there is hope, both for humanity and Hollywood. By the latter I mean it's hard to imagine how a film this original got made in an era of reboots, remakes, sequels and prequels (mostly bad)The characters are charming and quirky, the dialogue clever and the plot wisely confines itself to telling an intensely personal story rather than one of the war itself. The young male star is perfect, and the other performances shine as well. It does seem though that Scarlett got less time on the screen than she deserves.The director cleverly doesn't show us certain things, and a lot of good choices were made in the editing room.Hollywood, if you're listening, more like this please."
Jojo Rabbit,17-Feb-20,Among the best poetic anti war films made. Congratulations.
Jojo Rabbit,05-Nov-19,"I laughed. I cried.. Thank you, Taika Waititi, for this amazing film!Hands-down the best I've seen in 2019!"
Jojo Rabbit,25-Oct-19,"This is fantastic Political Satire; we need to be able use Satire in the correct way and Waititi did just that. If you think this movie is offensive here is Satires definition:Satire
1 a literary work holding up human vices and follies to ridicule or scorn
2 trenchant wit, irony, or sarcasm used to expose and discredit vice or folly"
Jojo Rabbit,27-Oct-19,"""What did they do?"" Jojo asks his mother, inquiring about the townspeople he sees hanging in the village square.""Plenty of good,"" Jojo's mother responds, reinforcing the noblest of convictions to both herself and her impressionable young son.The above interaction is just one of many poignant scenes found throughout Taika Waititi's 'Jojo Rabbit,' about a young boy in Germany's army who discovers that his mother is hiding a Jewish girl in their home.Beyond the many instances of poignancy and incisiveness, 'Jojo Rabbit' is equally packed with witty dialogue and humorous interludes, making it among the finest examples of satire to emerge from Hollywood in recent memory.So color us mystified as to why critics have given this gem such a paltry 78% rating on Rotten Tomatoes and 58% on Metacritic. Those who panned the movie are either unable to laugh at absurdity, or they themselves are so absurd that it's not worth anyone's time to read their brainsick thoughts."
Jojo Rabbit,16-Sep-19,"I was fortunate enough to catch Taika Waititi's latest film at the 2019 TIFF People's Choice Screening and what an absolute treat it was. In this ""anti-hate satire"", we follow the trials and tribulations of a German boy who finds a Jewish girl living in his attic and is confronted with a clash of his conditioned values as a little nazi boy. If you think the synopsis sounds crazy, you have no idea what you're in for...Though seemingly taking inspiration from the works of Wes Anderson and Mel Brooks, ""Jojo"" manages to create something in an entirely new ball park pulling off a spoof that manages to be hilarious while not disrespecting its touchy subject matter, a feat that only the wonderful Taika (who directed, wrote and acted as Imaginary Hitler in) could pull off so well. The film also boasts some killer cinematography as well as a wonderful soundtrack, both of which punctuate some of the films quieter moments to ground us in the era and atmosphere of the film.As mentioned above, Taiki plays the titular boy's imaginary Hitler friend and leaves you weak in the stomach from laughing so much - he's, quite simply, hilarious. And yet, he doesn't manage to overpower the rest of the cast which includes Sam Rockwell, Scarlett Jo and Rebel Wilson all of whom are wonderful. But most notably, it's the child performances that take center stage. The two little leads are incredible, making us laugh at times, shed a tear at others and just feel for the two of them. Their comedic timing, range and overall performances are done to a T - it's because of them the film works as well as it does.In today's day and age, more than ever, people need a reason to just sit back and smile and this makes ""Jojo Rabbit"" a truly timely film. Leave it to Mr. Waititi to take one of the most gruesome periods in human history and, believe it or not, find both a humour and beauty in its telling. It's also entirely original in its execution and is perhaps the perfect example of the kind of film Hollywood could use more of. All that's left to say is thanks for the laughs Taika; and for your brilliantly twisted mind!"
Jojo Rabbit,02-Jan-20,"There is no BUT!!!Everybody here is on point, emotional ride gallore!
And that is not the only thing,... what a great storyteller Waititi is!
What a good way to make people think!"
Jojo Rabbit,10-Nov-19,"Truly marvelous performances, and a story worthy of your time, expertly spun. Very comedic, but not a comedy. Sort of a 'Hugo' meets 'The Diary of Anne Frank' as directed by Monty Python. (best I could come up with, hardly adequate). The critics just got this one wrong, perhaps because they fear praising a work of art with controversial images. Predicting three or more Oscar nominations."
Jojo Rabbit,05-Feb-20,"JoJo Rabbit is a brilliant and brave attempt by Taika Waititi. This movie is crafted by pure creativity. 'An anti hate satire' is the tagline of the movie and the movie shows the Nazi era difficulties through humour and mind blowing dialogue (most from Scarlett Johansson). This was the year that I realised ScaJoh is an excellent actress. All of the cast was excellent including Roman Griffin Davies, Thomasin McKenzie (who both have a bright future), Taika Waititi, Rebel Wilson and an excellent Sam Rockwell. The fat boy also deserves mentioned. JoJo Rabbit deserves acclaim and more people should see it. I don't know why most of the critics hated it but screw them. Jojo Rabbit deserved that Oscar nod for Best Picture and even though there's no hope for winning it, I'm pretty sure the movie has inspired so much hearts and this movie will discussed in the future."
Jojo Rabbit,09-Sep-19,"Jojo Rabbit will divide critics into ; those who marvel at the latest , comedic , Golden Egg , produced by this goose , Taika Waititi and those that want to tear the goose apart , in an attempt to smear some gold , on their own ability to dissect and criticise . Every kid that walks away from this movie , wanting to be a better person , is a tiny step , to making the world a better place ( the goal of the movie ) Those critics who want to shut that down , before it starts , need to ask themselves "" why was everyone but me laughing ? "" Update 15/Sept Peoples Choice Award TIFF . Lesson... Never try to PAN (fry) a golden egg ! :-)"
Jojo Rabbit,05-Nov-19,"I've always said that a great ending can elevate your opinion on the film as a whole. Perhaps not completely shift how you feel, but certainly enhance or detract. I was enjoying the ride with Jojo Rabbit for awhile but I was waiting for the film to move me emotionally the way I'd heard it might. The last 15-20 minutes of the movie do just that. Boasting a hilarious script, unique direction from Taika, terrific performances all around, and a message that is as moving as any film this year, Jojo Rabbit is a win on all accounts. And perhaps, just the movie we need at this time. I absolutely adored this film.9.4/10"
Jojo Rabbit,25-Nov-19,"""Jojo Rabbit"" is a light-hearted comedy exploring dark elements. It tells the story of a 10-year-old boy growing up in Germany near the end of World War II. He's a lot like other boys his age, struggling to fit in and find his way, searching for group and sense of belonging. Unlike a lot of boys his age, he is a passionate Nazi who gleefully exclaims, ""Heil Hitler!"" as he skips down the street to a camp for young Nazis-in-training. Accompanying him as he skips, cheering him on, is his imaginary friend, Adolf Hitler, himself.Hitler, played with uproarious levels of buffoonery by writer/director Taika Waititi, provides many of the film's early laughs. Sadly, the movie fails to deliver on its early promise. It doesn't crash burn - the end product is still respectable - but all the parts never totally come together in a completely satisfying way. We hope for more from a proven entity like Waititi.The title ""Jojo Rabbit,"" as it turns out, is half the name of the 10-year-old boy and half the name of a cute, fluffy animal. Jojo (Roman Griffin Davis) becomes the begrudging recipient of the nickname ""Jojo Rabbit"" for his choice to not coldly murder an innocent rabbit while at Nazi camp. An older boy makes a different choice regarding the rabbit, then callously chucks the body across the woods.Jojo doesn't fit in here. He doesn't want to be a Nazi. He just doesn't know it yet.Jojo lives with his loving, playful mother, Rosie (Scarlett Johansson), who secretly works for the resistance. However, she allows Jojo to follow his misguided Nazi ways, knowing this will keep him safe from party members who search the town for dissenters. Johansson plays the part with impressive layers of complexity. While appalled by her son's Nazi passion, she understands that now is not the time to reprimand him. She quietly does her work and continues to love her son dearly, which is precisely why she opts not to tell Jojo about the young Jewish girl she is hiding in her wall.When Jojo finds the girl (Thomasin McKenzie), he is shocked and horrified. But he quickly discovers that she isn't at all the way Jews have been described to him. ""Where are your horns?"" He asks her sincerely.It's not long before Jojo begins to realize the girl he has been told is a monster is actually a friend, while his imaginary friend is the real monster. If you've seen any movies before, you know this is coming. Nevertheless, a few moments successfully tug at the heart strings. Another moment doesn't work quite as well and ends up feeling forced, even manipulative.The movie's execution winds up being a bit disappointing because of how much potential seemed possible in the opening act. The best moments are the funniest ones, usually featuring Hitler and Jojo, along with a few others that include the scene-stealing Archie Yates, who plays Jojo's friend.Despite the movie's success in comedic execution, the heavier material waivers, leaving the vision of the story a bit foggy. What could have been a best-of-the-year contender, winds up being merely an above average comedy."
Jojo Rabbit,02-Jan-20,"Jojo is a proud Hitler Youth member. He decides to go on a weekend for fellow brainwashed enthusiasts. However, after a (very funny) accident with a grenade he finds himself hospitalised. At home recovering he discovers that his mother is hiding a Jewish girl in their home. He confides this to his imaginary friend, Adolf Hitler (!)This film is actually a comedy! An off the wall, zany and irreverant comedy that works beautifully. It was a massive gamble to make such a film in such oversensitive and 'woke' times. And it was Disney of all studios that made Jojo Rabbit! Should such a terrible period from history be depicted in such a chirpy and comical way? Should Hitler be portrayed as such a goofball within the film? YES! Whether it's Mel Brooks (who said he loved JoJo Rabbit) with The Producers and it's musical Springtime For Hitler or Joan Rivers making her controversial joke about the Holocaust on Fashion Police, humour reaches the parts that more earnest and serious pieces of 'art' can't. It forces you to laugh at whatever is the target of the joke is and then analyse why you laughed at something that you normally wouldn't see as comical.Whilst most critics have lauded the film, there are peripheral pundits who have either said that the filmmakers have gone too far (How dare they make a comedy starring Adolf Hitler?!) or that they didn't go far enough (How dare they make a film about Nazi Germany and not show the full horror of what happened?!). The Guardian hated the film which is another reason for audiences go and see this gem of a film.But, understandably, everything depicted in the film isn't just for laughs. There are plenty of gut-wrenching moments when the full horror is brought home to the characters and audience alike. These poignant sequences aren't milked for all their worth and this makes them all the more powerful and genuine. There were a couple of pivotal scenes which made me fight back tears. These scenes were played out for what they were without the whole film descending into a tissue-soaking cry-a-thon which would have cheapened and devalued the movie's content.The film also looks beautiful with set designs and a colour palate that makes Jojo Rabbit a feast for the eyes. This film is beautifully constructed. Jojo's room, the house in which he resides, the cubby hole that houses Elsa and the surrounding environs are all aesthetically pleasing and a joy to behold.Also, check out the framing. Every scene feels just as quirky, off-kilter and as warped as the narrative. Watch out for the scene on the giant steps and the later scene with it's emphasis on a character's shoes and how this motif is used later on in the film in an extremely heartbreaking but dignified and tasteful way.The soundtrack is also fantastic with The Beatles' German language version of I Wanna Hold Your Hand ('Komm, gib mir deine Hand') and Bowie's Helden leading the way. In fact, these two rather obscure (to English eyes anyway) versions of well known songs normally heard in their Mother Tongue depict the whole feel of the film- off kilter, eschew and very original.There are uniformly amazing performances by the likes of Roman Griffin Davis playing Jojo, Scarlett Johannsen as his mother, Thomasin McKenzie as Elsa the Jewish hideaway and Sam Rockwell (great to see him taking more risks with his choice of roles after starring in the ultra-woke and unbearable Three Billboards). Also, look out for Stephen Merchant as a very sinister Nazi inspector. He reminded me of The Demon Headmaster. But it's director and screenwriter Taika Waititi who plays Adolf Hitler who steals the show. Every scene that hes in is comedy gold as he depicts Hitler as a kind of bro/dude best friend to Jojo. His lines and mannerisms are laugh out loud hysterical.4 parts humour, 1 part sentiment, this film has a power that will seep into your brain during it's running time and stay with you long after the film is over. In fact my first thought on leaving the cinema was that I wanted to see it again.I feel privileged to have seen one of the best films of 2020 on Jan the 1st of this year. A cracking start to a new decade of movies."
Jojo Rabbit,26-Nov-19,"Taika Waititi (""Thor Ragnarok"") is an auteur who I really respect, a lot. He has an incredibly unique, soulful, and humorous sensibility which, despite walking through dark themes and imagery at times, always seems to find a settled place in hope and peace. He has been able to keep this soul throughout films about vampires, foster care, parental death, and even the MCUs ""Thor Ragnarok,"" one of the best entries into the MCU Canon.It is a rare thing when a truly unique voice is given the opportunity to make a blockbuster like Thor and even more rare that they manage to maintain their artistic integrity as they do so. Considering this, I was eager to see ""Jojo Rabbit,"" apparently the film you make after a smashingly successful first go at a major Hollywood blockbuster and the cache' that success garners you, at least, that is, if you are Taika Waititi.The concept of this film is the other half of the draw, for me and, most likely, for many people who have seen the trailer. It's a pretty wild concept to look at the fall of the German Reich from the perspective of a naive wide-eyed eager young boy who is actually a pretty big fan of Hitler and really hates Jews. As I sat down to watch this film, I had moments where I hoped I was about to see something akin to ""Death of Stalin,"" poignant and cutting satire that leaned hard into its themes, with a dash of ""Moonrise Kingdom,"" childhood antics and adulting.In this regard, the film did not disappoint. Especially, the first 30 minutes or so of ""Jojo Rabbit"" is chock full of children hurting themselves, engaging in hilarious ignorance driven misspeak, and a healthy dose of sardonic wit in which the young troop of pseudo cub scouts seem more like children being thrown into basic training and brainwashing. This section is so enjoyable, partially because of the child actors who are simply stellar throughout. The thrill of team activity and camaraderie is writ large across all of their faces even as their confusion about things 'too-grow-up' for them begin to encroach on their happy go lucky fun in the woods lifestyle.This isn't all there is to life, though, as Jojo (Roman Griffin Davis) is soon to learn. Although he doesn't know it, his mother (Scarlett Johannson, ""Her"") is a member of the resistance and is hiding a Jewish girl in her attic. With Elsa (Thomasin McKenzie,""The King"") we get the introduction of an Anne Frank sort of character who forces Jojo into a bit of a quandary. On the one hand, he feels like he should turn her in but he also fears the 'devious ways of the Jew"" and suspects that turning her in may end up getting him and his mother in trouble. He decides instead to dedicate himself to learning and writing about the things he learns from her as a sort of study on Jews and why they are so awful.As you can see, this film has some really interesting character complexities at play and I haven't even gotten to Sam Rockwell (""Moon"") as the Troop Leader for the kids or Jojo's little fat friend in the Hitler Youth who has some of the best lines of the film.Unfortunately, this is where I have to say that I didn't love this film. For all of its great qualities which I described above, the film left me wanting. I don't think everyone will feel this way but there is no way around the fact that this film just didn't stick the landing for me. Why? I'm not exactly sure, and I'll own that.I don't know why I didn't walk out of the theater shouting about about how much I adore this film. Maybe, the humorous and dramatic parts weren't balanced in the way that I typically like or certain sections weren't as snappy as I expected. Either way, I end up feeling that, while it is a good movie, it isn't one I expect to watch more than once more in my life, if that.However, I do think that the film has an audience out there and I sincerely hope it finds that crowd. It is full of heart and the themes of seeking understanding about those different than us, the drive for acceptance, and confronting the ugly realities of life but not losing hope are surely important ones that anyone today will see the value of. Also, if you want to see a kid shoot a bazooka by accident and react as if he just spilled the milk instead of blowing up a building, then you may need to run out and see this film."
Jojo Rabbit,18-Feb-20,It should have won best picture. An amazing movie and a surprise.
Jojo Rabbit,07-Dec-19,"First off this movie is just amazing from the 1 second of the movie to the last second as it is able to portray war while still being able to be a hilarious and happy movie as it is able to keep comedy all while exposing some of the disturbing truths about war and patriotism i also have to say this movie had some of the best acting I have seen in awhile as the actors are able to portray their characters in a very realistic light while not going to over the top with it but just having fun with their role which in turn creates this masterpiece of a movie that feels like it was directed by someone like Quentin Tarantino except if it was pg13 of course but still it's able to do all of that and more as it also has some very funny scenes and some very sad tearjerker Esque scenes not to mention that this movie is able to combine the horrors of war like that of hacksaw ridge the coming of age of a teen movie like stephen Kings it the comedy of something like parks and recreation all while having amazing actor chemistry intense scenes and extremely hysterically dumb humor throughoutOne last thing I have to say is a recommend this for more 13 year olds and I know most people will disagree but some of the scenes are a little bit much as this movie contains most of its characters being killed in very disturbing fashions like hangings and being shot offscreen but still disturbing as you have come to know these characters quite well doin my opinion I would say wait till 13 or at least 12 to watch
All in all I give this review a.... 11 OUT OF TEN"
Aquaman,11-May-20,"And it has nothing to do with the comic books.Bad and pointlessWhat is the point of this film? A big beefcake? Because that's literally the only storyline this mess has going for it. Pointless characters, horrible CGI for this modern time, bad acting, I could continue. If I had went to the theater to see this, I would be trying to get my money back. I gave it a 3 only because of the nostalgia I have for Aquaman. That's all that is good about this excuse of an action/family film."
Aquaman,17-Dec-18,"What's with the 10 out of 10 reviews? really?. Sure it's probably the best (or second best) DC Justice league era, but that's not difficult.
Like all the other offerings, it's overblown, wooden, one dimensional and over reliant on over the top CGI.
As a child I was always a DC fan and I want them more than anything to bring this thing together, but Marvel have certainly laid down a tough marker for how it should be and DC still haven't met that challenge.
The main thing missing from the film is charm and simplicity, sure Momoa just about saves the day and I think he can develop Aquaman into a loved character, and the film is a step in the right direction. But 10 out of 10 it most certainly isn't."
Aquaman,15-Jan-19,"If you are a preteen, the story may work for you. If you have any common sense, the bad dialogue and blatant rip off of every sci-fi and fantasy movie cliche will drive you crazy.Special effects are decent, and the story moves along at a decent pace. Momoa carries the film despite being surrounded by one dimensional characters with digitally botoxed faces. I would never watch this movie again."
Aquaman,25-Apr-20,It was that bad.Total character assassination and a complete lack of understanding of what Aquaman is all about.
Aquaman,03-Apr-20,"I hate this story, but I just also learned of the things what the actress has done,I was so disappointed. Although she has done something wrong, I just wanna to say that the movie is pretty bad on its own and I hate the song especially Everything I Need. Also,the fight scenes are very boring ,just like real people fighting in front of you.The actors and director are the pits. I need another glass of wine."
Aquaman,16-Dec-18,"I have no idea why somebody would give this movie a good score, let alone 10. After 20 minutes I have decided that its for the best to switch my brain off and enjoy the show. But damn this movie is way too dumb. Character development is rushed and is given in a form of cringy and weak dialogues. Jokes feel like they are just out of place, but specific moments are created just for them to happen (which makes it even more ridiculous). There are some really stunning shots, but its more of an exception rather than the rule.
But the main issue, which makes this movie unwatchable without at least 4 cans of beer, is the fact that its linear as hell, there are 0 unpredictable plot twists, from the beginning of the movie (or even from trailers) you for sure know how its going to end.
Also the mood is unbelievably inconsistent, at some points characters are dead serious, while in 2 minutes they may be cracking jokes. Its not as bad as in Justice League, but black manta just looks pathetic with his constanty frowny or angry face.
WB, u evil corporate idiots, stop ruining your movies by trying to be like Marvel and making movies based on a formula which clearly doesn't work. It just looks like a parody and not a well done one."
Aquaman,09-Aug-19,.. Aquaman is quite classy and smart.Here he is a thuggish beefcake that talks trash and spends his time topless on the beach.No wonder humanity is in decline. Industrial pollutants??
Aquaman,18-Mar-20,"He would be fit and a lot more slim than the impostor in this film.By the way, what's up with sound being transmitted underwater like that?
Is Rian Johnson dropping bombs in space like The Last Jedi again?"
Aquaman,13-Jul-19,"Has anyone read the Aquaman comics? Does anyone know Aquaman's story? Does anyone care for Aquaman?This film is the story of a weird tattooed trash amphibian thug who speaks like a hoodlum and who, for some reason, gets trained on the beach with his top off.
It is like the trashy beefcake anti-hero of 21st century or something.what rubbish."
Aquaman,26-Dec-19,Now that this mystery has been resolved I have no interest in this film.It was boring and cliched. The main actor is probably another of those MMA meat heads with brain damage (if there were any brains to begin with) and the story defies physics.Poor (true) Aquaman!
Aquaman,06-Jan-19,"I don't know where the hype for this film comes from, because it can't be from the content. The dialogue and characters in this movie are often ridiculous in the least entertaining way possible. Silly can be entertaining, but it can also just feel stupid. The female characters only seem to exist to be Aquaman's conscience (because he can't think for himself, as he's boring), they have no flaws or vices (in other words no depth). The villain is a cheap charicature of the warmonger, with a few poorly expressed environmental ideas thrown into his perspective. The good points of this film fall mostly on the visuals. It is a stunning film in terms of the undersea beauty portrayed, a literal riot of colour across the screen. I would also say that action is pretty positive, the combat is intense and epic. Overral though, I wouldn't reccomend"
Aquaman,15-Jun-20,"Look at the so-called Aquaman in this movie. Does he look like a prince to you? His mother was a queen?? Not at all.
I am not sure why they strayed so far from the Aquaman we all like and love.I guess the main actor looks like a bouncer or something so the loutish market can see him and like this film.
People who do not know Aquaman (comics or cartoons) may like it however. I dont know."
Aquaman,13-Feb-20,"Absolutely not.He looks like a mob contractor who bangs heads not someone who dishes out wisdom and justice, which is the true traits of Aquaman."
Aquaman,07-Apr-20,When we saw it in the theatre we were literally laughing at it. It's so bad you can't help it. When will they stop making these?
Aquaman,14-Dec-19,He looks like the kind of urban thug who shops at Wal-mart?Yikes.
Aquaman,02-Jun-20,"Probably the worst comic book movie ever I'd rather watch ""Eyes wide shut "" atleast they showed Kiddmans rack"
Aquaman,05-Apr-20,Who cast this guy? I bet he is a WWE or MMA loser with the brain damage that goes with it.How pathetic.No wonder the film repelled me. Aquaman is an arbiter of justice not a Duck Dynasty extra.
Aquaman,03-May-19,"Some trashy tattooed thug who looks like he is even more gross than the Rock trash talks and speaks rudely and crudely all over the place and they want us to believe he is the son of a queen and royalty.
No wonder the movie included rap 'music.'
Anyone who has read an Aquaman comic book will shake his head in sadness."
Aquaman,17-Jan-19,"C'mon, 10/10 seriously? the director used every action figure/action movie ever created to fight with or against Aquaman, splashing on testosterone. The Atlantis guards are Power Rangers, the underwater fighter jets are from Star Wars, the battle with other underwater kingdoms looks like a battle from the Lord of the Rings, some personages are a version of the Street Sharks, even Godzila had a resurrection moment!. Do you remember the Disney's the Sword in the Stone? even the guy name is Arthur! Did you spotted the dinosaurs at Jurasic Park? I only missed a Smeagol-like scene with the trident... my prrrrecioussss.Ah, and a very funny scene is watching Aquaman trying not to fall (and looking very scared) from the roof of one house in Sicily (two stories high) , when he'd just jumped from a plane thousand meters high with no parachute in the desert.But Nicole Kidman was beautiful as always."
Aquaman,26-Jan-19,"Everything I saw, read and heard about 'Aquaman' before it came out had me convinced it wouldn't be my cup of tea. My impression was that this would be yet another bloated studio tentpole with cheesy dialog, a generic story and artificial looking CGI. However, once it opened, a passionate film fan I respect a lot started spreading so much obviously genuine enthusiasm for the movie that I eventually got over myself and watched it.I think it was the moment when Nicole Kidman swallowed a goldfish that I started to suspect I might actually enjoy this movie. That suspicion, however, turned out to be wrong, because I didn't just enjoy it: I ended up ADORING it. The weirdest thing: the film DID contain all those elements I had feared - and yet none of that seemed to matter. It just works. It shouldn't, but it somehow does, which is why I've since come to the conclusion that director James Wan is some sort of genius wizard filmmaker. Don't let the generic superhero tropes and cheesy dialog fool you into thinking this was a typical mainstream movie (though I DO suspect those things managed to fool the studio executives into thinking exactly that: which is probably how James Wan got away with it), because in truth, this is the least generic, most bonkers big budget studio flick I've seen in ages. It's the film 'Valerian' wants to be. It's crazy; it's over-the-top; it's beautifully designed with incredible attention to every little detail in every frame; it doesn't take itself seriously for a second, and yet it fully commits to - and loves - its characters and the world they inhabit.I was awed, literally awed by the design of the Atlantian society and technology; the worldbuilding and visuals are so distinct and original - which caught me completely off guard, because I didn't expect that in a 200 million studio picture for the masses. When the music score went into full synthesizer mode as ""Aquabro"" and Mera arrive on the collapsed bridge leading to the underwater city, and the screen virtually explodes with the most colorful creatures and underwater vehicles imaginable, I had a stupid grin on my face out of pure joy and adoration for this stunning display of artistic vision (the stupid grin stayed on my face for the remainder of the movie). And the film didn't let up. 'Aquaman' never loses steam; there's no weak third act (at least in my opinion); the wondrous discoveries and beautiful, unexpected designs and creatures keep coming until the very end. Although it has a very different tone, I was actually reminded of watching 'LOTR: The Return of the King' for the first time.It's true, 'Aquaman' delivers the typical, clichéd, cheesy superhero tropes in spades, but those generic story beats - some of which were probably demanded by the studio - seem to be all surface; they're not what James Wan (or his characters) are really interested in. It almost seems to me that the director only used those tropes as camouflage to sneak in nods to every film of every genre he ever loved and get really creative with the worldbuilding. His biggest accomplishment, however - the film's greatest strength - is something that only few blockbusters ever achieve: he successfully combines a genuine sense of wonder and awe with complete, unabashed fun.So, to sum up this review: against my expectations, the superhero film I least expected to like managed to do what not a single superhero movie so far had done for me; it filled me with an urge to immediately see it again, because I was so in love with its bonkers, ""everything-but-the-kitchen-sink"" approach to filmmaking. Naturally, I now hope James Wan will also direct 'Aquaman 2', as I'm sure if given the chance, next time not even the kitchen sink will be safe.P.S.

Aquaman,08-Dec-18,"Finally, DC seems to be moving towards the right direction. I a big fan of superhero movies, not caring whether it Marvel or DC. The movie is very straightforward and you quickly get excited to know what's to come next after the first act. And oh please, the songs used are really good plus the visuals are really good. There are lots of surprisingly good underwater battle scenes and oh my that battle with Black Manta kills it. The main characters are very well explored. The ending could have been done better but it seems that would have made the movie's runtime longer. It's really worth the 2 hours of watching it as the pacing is really good."
The Firm,14-Mar-01,"In The Firm, Tom Cruise plays an extremely intelligent young lawyer who takes a job with a tremendous firm, having been seduced by their huge financial offerings. ""The Firm"" begins to sound very creepy very early in the film, when it becomes known that `the firm' has never had a divorce, `the firm' encourages children,' `the firm' is a big, happy, 41 member family. Unfortunately, it seems that another interesting little side note is that no one has ever left `the firm' and lived. Mitch McDeere (Cruise) is hired by `the firm,' and at first, everything is great. The firm loves him enough to pay back all of his student loans all at once, and he is completely taken in by everything, even down to the way that the firm furnished his new house, in his beautiful new neighborhood (`To make you feel at home. Hope you don't mind.'). The lives of Mitch and his wife Abby (Jeanne Triplehorn) are completely and drastically changed when he is hired by the firm, setting up a disorienting atmosphere, especially when strange things start happening, people getting killed by boat bombs and whatnot. Gary Busey plays a small, seedy role, and it works really well because he's best at playing seedy characters. Ed Harris also delivers a good performance as an FBI agent trying to coerce McDeere into helping them investigate the big bad firm. It seems that McDeere has been helping the firm in its illegal activities, making him guilty without him even knowing about it. If he doesn't help the FBI, he'll go to jail with the other 40 members of that big, happy family. The Firm really gets going once McDeere starts trying to investigate, making copies of incriminating files, etc. Some things may have gone a little too far, like the conveniently placed pillow truck, but as a whole, The Firm is a great thriller. It may not be quite as good as other John Grisham adaptations, The Rainmaker, in particular, but The Firm's complex and fascinating plot, as well as good direction and acting, makes it way above average."
The Firm,05-May-01,"All the elements to make a hard-hitting melodrama of corruption (with FBI and Mafia aspects present) are unfolded here in a gripping yarn from John Grisham's novel. Tom Cruise is excellent as a young man who joins a small but prosperous law firm, only to discover that all the perks he enjoys come at great expense to his integrity, not to mention his life. The plot thickens when members of the firm are murdered and Cruise gets drawn into the unmasking of the firm, risking his life to reveal the criminals. Gene Hackman, Ed Harris, Holly Hunter and Hal Holbrook all give strong performances, with Hunter fully deserving her Oscar nomination. The pacing is good despite the film's length (well over 2 1/2 hrs.) and there's seldom a dull moment. Especially gripping is the supercharged climax.
Not having read the book, I see where others are disappointed with the ending. Having no comparison to make, I can only say that it kept me absorbed until the final scene. Definitely a must-see if you enjoy action thrillers with a climactic punch. One of the best films of the '90s, full of suspenseful twists and turns."
The Firm,31-May-01,"I read ""The Firm"" after watching it, not knowing what expect (I didn't know if it would be a tight or loose adaptation). It was pretty close, with the difference mainly lying in the ending, and that where Sydney Pollack makes this story go from good to great: The book, at the end, makes Mitch out to be a coward and a traitor at the end, by making him give into the FBI. But, in the film, Mitch is seen as a hero who doesn't give into anyone. The FBI doesn't win and the Mafia doesn't win. Mitch wins. He bows down to no one. Tom Cruise also plays a *great* Mitch McDeere, with a lot of intensity and charisma. You cheer for him as the protagonist. Holly Hunter is top-notch with her portrayal of the vulnerable, secretary turned accomplice Tammy. Gene Hackman is also great as Avery Tolar, the one bad guy who sympathizes with Mitch and Abby. Such a great screen presence. His scenes while they're in the Kaymen Islands are key ones to watch. Jeanne Tripplehorn finally makes up for her role in ""Basic Instinct"" as Abby McDeere, the ""cheated wife"", not only by her husband, but also by the firm he works for. Sydney Pollack showcases some of his best work as director, especially by the opening segment that describes Mitch McDeere perfectly in the span of less than 10 minutes. Such a GREAT adaptation, and a even better film to watch!"
The Firm,30-Jun-07,"Tom Cruise, the All American kid from the trailer park who worked his way through Harvard Law School, just got the dream job with a prestigious white shoe law firm in Memphis, Tennessee. Sounds like he's on his way to the top with wife Jeanne Tripplehorn. But it turns out to be a nightmare. This Firm's main client is a Chicago crime family and they launder the mob's money. Now the FBI in the persons of fatherly Steven Hill and hard-nosed Ed Harris are squeezing Cruise to infiltrate and get incriminating information. That would result in disbarment for violating lawyer/client privilege. And The Firm isn't a gang of boy scouts either. They're not above a little blackmail and entrapment and they've got a security man in Wilford Brimley who's real good at it.How Tom Cruise gets out of this rock and a hard place situation is the plot of The Firm. Sydney Pollak gave him one stylish cast in support and everyone of them delivers. Even players like Gary Busey, Hal Holbrook, Gene Hackman, take essentially supporting roles because this film was a guaranteed blockbuster. All of John Grisham's novels have their own built in audience, The Firm is no exception. I do remember my mother was a devoted reader of his work, whereas I always await the film version.Holly Hunter got an Oscar nomination for her small role as private detective Gary Busey's secretary and girl Friday. When Hunter witnesses Busey's murder without the hit men knowing it, she sets the wheels in motion for the downfall of the bad guys. Hunter got nominated for Best Actress for The Piano and Best Supporting Actress for The Firm, a most unusual occurrence. She won for The Piano in 1993, but lost the Supporting Actress Award to her co-star in The Piano, Anna Paquin. Winning both would have just been a bit too much for the Academy voters.The Firm has a far fetched plot to be sure in the way that Tom Cruise brings them all down. Still that's the charm of it. It's almost Hitchcockian in its pace and mood, and even more resembles the Mission Impossible television series in the way it's all brought off. Small wonder that Tom Cruise was chosen to star in the big screen adaptations of that television classic.When I watch The Firm, I'm reminded of that line from another television classic that one Hannibal Smith used to say about he loved it when a plan comes together. That's what you will like about The Firm."
The Firm,18-Mar-06,"This is a long (154 minutes) but pretty solid drama-suspense story about corporate corruption. The film features a well-known cast, and as soon as the action kicks in this becomes a very tense story.Tom Cruise is very good as the hotshot lawyer, as is Jeanne Tripplehorn who plays his unhappy wife. This is a complex story at times, one not always easily understood, especially the ending. So much is explained so fast at the end it's tough to comprehend it all.Wilfred Brimley, Gene Hackman, Hal Holbrook, Holly Hunter, Robert Strathairn and Ed Harris all make this a really deep, impressive cast. For more details of the story, check some of the other reviews."
The Firm,25-May-10,"The Firm (1993)The twist in the plot as you realize this Memphis law firm is not what it seems, and the rather innocent freshman lawyer played by Tom Cruise is slow to catch on, is the core of the movie, and a relief. It starts steadily, or slowly, depending on your patience, and in fact plays many scenes out in more detail than we need for a kind of bookish thriller. It's not a bad ride, and there are some further, minor twists, but it's not packed tightly enough, or frankly original enough, to lift its boots out of the sand.Director Sydney Pollack, hugely successful as a director and actor, might have just had bad scriptwriting here by David Rabe, because John Grisham's book had proved itself. The acting is really solid (I'm no Cruise fan, but he's fine), but the characters are often doing things that just don't quite follow, or that are improbable or stupid. Or they end up doing something dangerous and the danger is either watered down or ridiculous. Examples that come to mind are how they show Cruise discovering or stealing or xeroxing files. We get the plot, but it lumbers along, or is just shown, not built up with suspense. The cinematographer takes a hit here, I think. Things are often nicely framed and routinely well done, but a thriller needs to hide some things, show some things, create ambiance and mystery, and so on, visually. It doesn't really happen.So, for a kind of technical high-stakes, rich person's good-guy bad-guy suspense film, it will get you through, but barely. By the last five minutes, if you aren't sucked in, you'll want to scream ""hurry up!"""
The Firm,03-Jul-06,"When ""The Firm"" came out was - believe it or not - the first time that I had ever heard of Tom Cruise (although I didn't see the movie until several years later). And let me tell you, this was a great introduction. Cruise plays novice lawyer Mitch McDeere, who goes to work for a Memphis firm. With this firm, he has everything that anyone could want. But there's the question: why does everything seem so perfect? The answer lies in the firm's unseemly other side. And they're not just going to let Mitch blow their cover.Sydney Pollack pulled off everything perfectly here. It's sort of like an Ira Levin novel how everything plays out. You may be suspicious of everything after seeing this movie. Above all, it shows that Tom Cruise can actually do a good job when he tries. Also starring Jeanne Tripplehorn, Gene Hackman, Hal Holbrook, Wilford Brimley, Ed Harris, Holly Hunter, David Strathairn and Gary Busey.It's hard to believe that this was the first movie adaptation of a John Grisham novel."
The Firm,02-Jan-05,"This movie was the movie that finally drove the fact home to me that Tom Cruise was a good actor and pushed him to the front of the line. The casting was really really great and the plot was first rate. Cruise is a fresh out of college law student named Mitch with a pretty new wife who is dreaming of becoming a successful and big name lawyer. So as any other graduate he is sending out resumes and getting offers from different firms. But one firm from Memphis, Tennessee gives him an offer he can't refuse. It seems like a small homegrown firm that is very wealthy and prosperous and prides itself on being the best. But this isn't any ordinary law firm. It's a ""Family"" with a history of partners having premature deaths and now Mitch is part of it. And he can't get out. Not alive anyways. So Mitch has to find a way out without joining the list of expired former associates. Gene Hackman in this is incredibly, stunningly, unbelievably great. His character quickly becomes Cruise's mentor. He is an unhappy, alcoholic, womanizing ambulance chaser (albeit an highly powerful and prosperous one) who also cannot escape either and is the linchpin in the unfolding drama that Cruise and Tripplehorn find themselves square in the middle of. Hackman is the one you should despise and dislike right from the beginning but you can't even if you try very hard because he is a likable person and you know he is in serious trouble which makes you emphasize with him right from the get go. My favorite Grisham book adaptation it made him a household name to this very day. Also features appearances by Paul Sorvino, Gary Busey, and Holly Hunter."
The Firm,08-Nov-03,"I wanted to get a copy of the screenplay to compare the movie with the dialog and directions, but initially received the FIRST draft by David Rabe. I finally got the shooting script later.  All I can say is that it ended with Mc Deere blowing away all the partners in a restaurant with an AK-47. It really made me appreciate the re-write by David Rayfiel and Robert Towne. I have watched this movie many times and enjoy the suspense, romance, and Grusin's solo piano score, which always blows me away.  But the one thing that impressed me most with multiple viewing, is how Gene Hackman really makes the movie work.  His portrayal of this corrupt, but incredably likeable character is the one thread that holds the movie together for me and goes down as one of his most memorable acting performances."
The Firm,05-Jun-99,"Though not the best of the Grisham adaptations, this is up to the usual high standard in plot and stars that Grisham movies have become associated with. The plot on this one is a little more far-fetched probably on account of the fact that this was one of Grisham's first works, escapism and entertainment seem to be the most prominent here, other Grisham works had begun to develop other traits alongside populism, like being almost topical and seeming to make social comment on issues that Grisham must have had an inside eye on when he was actually involved in the legal business for all those years. The Rainmaker is a great example of this when a young lawyer takes on a pro bono case of a widow's suit against a rogue insurance company that wouldn't pay up on  a claim for her son's illness, and who as a result died from it. You will find none of this in the Firm, it is the straightforward story of a young lawyer whose life becomes entangled in the law firm from hell, which has all the usual mafia connections and all the usual FBI hardball characters battling with the caricatures from the Mafia. It does however make great entertainment , you will soon forget how far-fetched and improbable it all is, as you will become instantly fascinated, and stick with 155 minutes of plot twists and turns."
The Firm,27-Oct-15,"Anyone who has experienced poverty or hardship in their early life never forgets the experience and always retains a certain element of insecurity about wealth, regardless of how much financial success they later achieve. In ""The Firm"", it's this phenomenon that essentially drives a brilliant young law student to ignore numerous offers of career-enhancing opportunities from a number of prestigious big city law firms to, instead, join a small Memphis partnership who offer him a fantastic remuneration package. Unfortunately, what follows, perfectly illustrates the wisdom of the old adage that ""if something seems too good to be true, it probably is"".Mitch McDeere (Tom Cruise) is the Harvard Law School graduate from a poor background whose exceptional academic achievements lead to him being head-hunted by ""Berdini, Lambert & Locke"". The firm offer him a huge salary, a low-interest mortgage, a Mercedes and the repayment of his student loans and in return, Mitch readily agrees to join them. After relocating to Memphis with his wife Abby (Jeanne Tripplehorn), he quickly settles into the practice and regularly works long hours. Initially, he's comfortable with the firm's family ethos and doesn't share Abby's unease about some of the advice she receives such as ""the firm encourages children"" etc. A little later, however, when he realises that a high percentage of the firm's work is related to the activities of the Mob and a couple of the firm's lawyers suddenly die in mysterious circumstances, he gets the strong feeling that something sinister is going on.Mitch's suspicions are confirmed when he gets approached by the director of the FBI and Agent Wayne Tarrance (Ed Harris) who inform him about the firm's criminal and money-laundering activities. They want Mitch to supply them with information and documents to be used as evidence to bring his employers to justice and add that if he doesn't co-operate, things will be made very difficult for his brother who's in jail facing a manslaughter charge. They also emphasise that Mitch effectively doesn't have any choice in the matter because no partner has ever left the firm alive and if he simply decides to stay with the firm, he could face 20 years in prison when they go down, as they inevitably will.Mitch knows it would be impossible to pass on the documents that the FBI want without breaching the confidence of his legitimate clients and taking that action would inevitably lead to the loss of his licence to practice law. He therefore realises that in order to meet their demands without losing his career, making his brother's parlous situation worse or winding up dead at the hands of his ruthless employers (or the Mob), he needs to devise an imaginative plan to get out of the trap he's in. When he then discovers that the firm have routinely been over-billing clients for some considerable time, he starts to see an opportunity to formulate just such a plan but, of course, its success is by no means guaranteed.Based on John Grisham's bestselling novel, this glossy thriller was understandably a huge box-office success. It's intriguing, tense and highly entertaining and features a whole collection of great performances from its star-studded cast. Surprisingly though, it's Gary Busey, Gene Hackman, Ed Harris and Holly Hunter that really bring the screen to life in their relatively small parts while Tom Cruise and Jeanne Tripplehorn also do well in their starring roles."
The Firm,04-Jan-05,"You really can't fault any of the performers here. Tom Cruise has a boyish high-school handsomeness and an unthinkingly naive demeanor to go with it. Jeanne Triplehorn has big dark soulful eyes and does and says what she's supposed to. But the lesser actors are the more interesting. And they are here in droves. Gene Hackman, the late What's-his-name Viterelli (I can only think of him as ""Jelly"" in ""Analyze This""), Holly Hunter looking sexy and sassy, a hypomanic Gary Busey who, when capable of it, really delivers, Paul Sorvino who underplays (honest), Hal Holbrook and Wilfred Brimley being nasty, poor Tobin Bell as the albino who must have played a dozen hit men and mass murderers by now, Ed Harris now with a completely shaved head, Terry Kinney as the pale blond nice guy who conceals his demons, and Steven Hill as a ruthless FBI man.The performances and the locations make this worth a dekko. This ought to be Sidney Pollack's turf alright -- corruption in a law firm and illegal activities by the authorities, the kind of polluted panorama that he often finds appealing. But somehow it doesn't come off. I haven't read John Grisham's book but it's hard to believe the plot could be as complicated as this movie. There were times when I was completely lost, especially towards the end when the firm begins to unravel and the chases and breathless phone calls start.Probably the most interesting character's is Gene Hackman's crooked but very human lawyer. His scenes with Tripplehorn are really quite good, his hesitations, awkward silences, embarrassed chuckles, and vapid smiles. His last scene with her, as he lies half drugged in bed, is outstanding.The ending is hard to swallow. Cruise gives the Feds just enough legal information to put the bad guys away for several years, based on the fact that the firm overbilled its clients and used the post office to do it, which is a federal offense. A clever move on the part of Cruise but I had a hard time visualizing these murdering wealthy perps doing any jail time. I mean, for what? For sending a client a bill that charged too much? That would put my plumber in jail, my doctor, my shrink, and a strange porno web site that I once unwittingly subscribed to -- but these guys? Nope. Even if they were convicted, I see Dershowitz handling the appeal"
The Firm,05-Oct-14,"Back in the early 1990's, movies based on lawyers and law were everything, so it's no surprise that many of John Grisham's books were adapted into screen during this time, including this movie The Firm. The Firm is actually a really tense, character-driven thriller that works despite a stuffy running time and a very confusing plot(especially the last half-hour.) The screenplay is effective, but kudos to those who can follow the entirety of the plot because it was hard to follow at times.Sydney Pollack's film is about this very smart man who is on the cusp of graduating from Harvard when he is offered a package at this law firm in Memphis which can afford him an affluent lifestyle. But little does he know the firm has a sinister side. When the FBI talks to him about the firm and asks him to be an insider, Mitch McDeere's life will be forever changed.This film has a well-rounded cast and everyone is put to good use. Tom Cruise does a great job using brain and muscle to sort things out. Gene Hackman does a great job as his flawed, but kind character. Jeanne Tripplehorn is effective as Mitch's wife, Abby. We also get smaller key performances from Ed Harris as the FBI investigator and David Strathairn as Mitch's older brother, Ray who is serving time for manslaughter.Overall, The Firm is a very interesting movie. The plot is all over the place and the film runs over two and a half hours, but the film never becomes boring and it's not all that hard to put the pieces together. I also like the jazzy piano score by Dave Grusin. It sounds upbeat at times, but it adds to the film. A very suspenseful thriller and I was surprised how fast my heart was beating in the three-way battle between Mitch, the FBI, and the Firm. I rate this film 8/10."
The Firm,28-May-10,"In this excitingly convoluted genre piece by Sydney Pollack---who blossomed into a straightforwardly commercial director who was happily a part of the commercial mainstream, unlike such surviving contemporaries as Sidney Lumet and Woody Allen---Tom Cruise plays Mitch McDeere, a poor boy who is embarrassed by his meager roots now that he has graduated from Harvard Law fifth in his class. He gets offers from the top law firms in New York and Chicago, yet ultimately opts for a smaller firm stationed in Memphis. His choice is money-minded. He regards money as peace of mind, however later in the film he is less certain than he's ever been of how flush he'd need to have to be truly at peace.Some movies about the law reduce the judiciary elements to the rank of incidental. This one squeezes them for all they're worth. Without betraying too much of the story, I can say that McDeere is soon enough being blackmailed by both the FBI and the firm's security chief, grizzled and mild Wilford Brimley, quite compelling in an unusual jaunt as a bad guy. To protect himself, Mitch has to exercise both mind and body, eluding hit men and outwitting lawyers, to save both his life and his license to practice law.Drawn from the novel by John Grisham, as adapted by three of the most high-priced screenwriters at the time, this star-studded suspense melodrama takes an admirable two and a half hours to work its way through a hair-splitting ethical hodgepodge. By the finale, regardless of McDeere's gasping expounding during phone calls in the middle of a chase sequence, his plan of action is bewildering. And then there is the one character who never saw two particular killers when she witnessed another character's death because she was totally enclosed and hidden, which is how she survived, but in a later scene with Mitch, she says she saw the killers and details what they looked like, even the color of one's eyes, the one actually being an albino. However, it doesn't seem as far-fetched as it would were the style of the movie not as competent even when the fine points were bleary.Sydney Pollack, usually a solid director of easy-going entertainment, liked to make big, demanding movies and he was secure working with huge stars. Whether or not that colors his movies with a sugar-coated worthiness, he utilized them as abbreviated exposition. Case in point: One glance at Hal Holbrook as the top dog of the Firm and we sense it's a suspicious organization. Holbrook almost always plays the ostensibly dignified man with skeletons in his closet. One look at Gene Hackman, as the law partner who becomes Cruise's coach, and we know he's an incredibly faulty yet essentially not such a bad man, as he always is. One look at Cruise and we get a complacent feeling, because he is, in lots of his roles, just a little slow to figure things out. His characters appear to trust people too readily, and so it seems authentic when he accepts the Firm's song and dance and inducements.The movie is practically a compilation of great small character performances. Ed Harris, menacing with a shaved head, mainly requires little more than a couple of concise appearances to persuasively disclose the FBI's case against the Firm, and to divulge its airy readiness to force a potential witness to undergo impossible duress. Another potent performance is by David Strathairn, as the brother McDeere hasn't told the Firm about. Strathairn has arisen as one of the most commanding character actors around. There are also rich performances by Gary Busey, as an articulate private eye, and especially by Holly Hunter, as his allegiant secretary. Actually, watching this high falutin' legal thriller, it hit me that law firms have to some extent usurped Army platoons as Hollywood's most enjoyed universal human setting. The new law thrillers have the same components as those reliable old World War II action films: Assorted cultural and character archetypes who battle each other when they're not battling the enemy. The law movies have one formidable leg-up: the female characters engage equally in the fray, rather than simply cooking, cleaning and writing letters.The vast peanut gallery of characters makes The Firm into a persuasive Hollywood landscape. There are enough convincing people here to give McDeere a genuine environment to inhabit. And Pollack was forbearing inwith some ways with his material. He would allow a scene to go on until the point was made somewhat more acutely. That would let an actor like Hackman be stunningly compelling in scenes where he delicately authenticates that, in spite of everything, he has a decent soul. A sensitive scene near the climax between Hackman and Tripplehorn is like an advanced course in acting. The parts of The Firm seem better than the whole. And there are some great parts."
The Firm,07-May-12,"I always assumed that no movie based on John Grisham's books can be boring. Why? Because all of them include the most gripping and thrilling stories ever. And it can't be denied that one of their most amazing aspects is that they are perfectly fitted to be adapted onto the big screen. I wanted to watch this film since the time that I have finished reading The Firm, this amazing book, which turned Grisham into a world class writer. I craved for more of its pure excellence. I just needed to see Sydney Pollack's vision. And I am so happy to say right now that he certainly didn't let me down.Tom Cruise, still in his early days of glory, is an ideal Mitch McDeere, the young, ambitious and somehow innocent young lawyer. The man just passed the bar exam and started looking for a job. And then he found what he thought was a perfect opportunity for a well-paid job of his dreams. Unfortunately, this all seemed a bit too good to be totally legit and risk-free. But, at the time, who could tell that this particular firm is controlled by a group of dangerous Mafia thugs?This is the moment when the fun starts. The fast-paced sequences begin to roll. The viewer starts to uncover one secret after another of the overly corrupted Bendini, Lambert & Locke law firm. The suspense is heightening with every scene and that is what makes you concentrated all the time. You simply don't want to miss any part of the action. And I can assure everybody, it won't stop until the last minute. This is what makes the movie so similar to the book - you just can't stop till you know the whole story all the way through. Of course they had to do some rewrites and cut out some of the scenes and subplots (even though the movie is still relatively long). This is probably why the movie seems a bit chaotic at times. Also, I didn't like what the did with the ending, it should have stayed as it was described in the book.On another topic, I love the way that all of the great supporting characters build up the plot. And the stars that play them. One of the most memorable cameos of this movie must be the one made by Gary Busey. The only person that really didn't convince me was Jeanne Tripplehorn. I pictured Mitch's wife very differently - let's just say she seemed more beautiful and appealing in my mind. However, that still didn't stop Gene Hackman's character as he tried to seduce her in the most adorable way (one of the best scenes in my opinion).Even though I found the book more exciting than the movie, I still highly recommend it for its ever-occurring suspense and the atmosphere that causes shivers on the back. You won't find many law thrillers like this one for sure - except maybe for other Grisham masterpieces.8/10"
The Firm,05-Aug-10,"Some would call that a legal thriller but that would be reducing it too much because there is little court action, in fact there is no court action. It is all about how you can fool the FBI, get your feet out of the rich mud in which they are and at the same time remain absolutely true to your oath as a lawyer when you were registered, sworn in to be more precise, to the local bar, here Memphis, Tennessee. But it is a very good film on one legal loophole in our society. A lawyer knows about the crimes of his clients and if these clients are criminals what can the lawyer do when he is under the menace of being killed if he stops doing his good job. That's the first interest of the film. Lawyers cannot because of their oath do anything and yet it is their legal duty to do something. So it will have to be like for Al Capone, a collateral problem that has nothing to do with the business of the client. That's the real loophole of our legal system. Everyone has the absolute legal obligation to report a crime they know about, except lawyers and priests, and that is immoral. A lawyer has to defend his client. An accused criminal has to be defended in court the best way possible. But hiding the crime you know about is not defending, it is concealing. Our society has some kind of a flaw there, and it goes back a long way. Is our justice really equal for all and just for all, victims and criminals alike? The second interest of the film is the super exploitation young lawyers can be the target or the victim of. They are bought by some legal firms with millions of money and merchandize just to be over exploited for a certain amount of time, for doing what they are asked to do, for keeping their mouth shut, including inside the firm, for being subservient servile servants of their older partners. The wives are demanded to be their wives and that's all, and that's hard enough, waiting for them at night when they work late, worrying, but not too much when there is something strange, caressing and cajoling the Dearies when they go through a difficult period, etc. This profession in this society is essentially misogynistic. What about women lawyers today? Then the film shows how the famous Cayman Islands were used in those days as a haven for business, crime, tax evasion, speculation, prostitution and many other options in evil doing. Finally it also shows how justice can be short-circuited by the simple system of ""parole"" and turned into a means to pressurize one person by paroling or not paroling another. The film is well built, full of resources, action too, and rather moral in the end, even if the main criminals will go on running, in that case the mafia and their lawyers. Our society is so hypocritical. Shedding crocodile tears all the time on the poor little poor people who suffer so much. Let me give you twenty euros or twenty dollars for you to go to the restaurant and forget about your misery.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Créteil, CEGID"
The Firm,13-Oct-14,"I am not impressed with Tom Cruise as an actor, but this is one movie I MIGHT watch again, due to the seriously gifted cast, including Miss Tripplehorn. there is enough tension in the plot to show what could happen in a thoroughly immoral, power hungry business. I can truthfully say that virtually everything I know of Memphis, aside from the home of Elvis, I learned from this film. My thanks to those in charge of such details. Everything, I know of Memphis, aside from Graceland, I learned from this film .Again My thanks to those in charge of such details. Many of us will never be able to travel to all the places we would love to see.I have noted this fact in previous reviews. Please give us more location details. It is our armchair tour guide."
The Firm,18-Jan-00,"This is really one of the most interesting movies if ever seen. But not only because of the great acting from Tom Cruise. The greatest thing about this movie is the Oscar-nomminated O.S.T. by Dave Grusin. Really genius. The story is intelligent, basing on a novel by John Grisham, and really exciting. Go and see the movie, you'll really love it!"
The Firm,19-Apr-11,"John Grisham fairly burst on the scene with the very definition of a page-turner in the legal thriller The Firm. His novel is slick, manipulative, undeniably fast-paced and suspenseful. Keep those last two terms in mind, because fast-paced and suspenseful can never be ascribed to the stillborn, ponderous mess that Sydney Pollack perpetrates on the viewer.The storyline centers on idealistic young attorney Tom Cruise, who joins a prestigious Southern law firm that ends up having ties to organized crime and begins to take control of his life. The novel details the dawning realization and horror that the attorney and his wife face when it is discovered that they are basically owned by The Firm and their lives are in danger should they ever step out of line. The film details pretty much the same story with some rather wrong-headed derivations and devoid of any tensions or excitement.The cast is par excellence. There is not even a minor role not inhabited by a first-rate actor. Cruise is ideally cast as the attorney. Gene Hackman is reliable as his mentor at the firm. Unfortunately, of the remaining cast, only Holly Hunter makes much of an impression as a canny private detective's secretary who ends up helping the lead couple. Jeanne Tripplehorn spends much of the film looking constipated as Cruise's wife. The film offers her a mid-way revelation that results in her spending an obscene amount of time moping on a set of swings. The various shady characters at the firm that instilled such fear and distrust in the novel are inhabited on screen by a diversity of non-threatening, retirement age actors - like Hal Holbrook. And to play the terrifying head of security and enforcer of the firm - the man that no one wants to mess with - Pollack casts Wilford Brimley - the avuncular grandfather figure from the oat bran commercials. Apparently Pollack was going for irony, but it blows up in his face. There is something to be said when Ed Harris' relatively sympathetic FBI agent comes off as more of a threat than the assassins dogging Cruise. With the likes of Holbrook and Brimley out to get him, Cruise just has to rev up to a hearty shuffle in order to avoid them.The pace is the film's worst problem. It is stagnant from start to finish. There is literally no stretch of excitement in the entire film based on a novel that was swimming in it. Part of the issue is that Pollack seems to think the story is of biblical importance and needs to be portrayed with unflagging solemnity - in short, he is too good to stoop to a thrill. The film is tragically overlong and easily feels like triple the length it is. Anything that was remotely exciting from the novel has been removed or depicted in such a painfully tedious fashion lest one break a sweat.Even worse, changes made in the story and the outcome in particular make no sense. The true evil of the firm was actually the organized crime syndicate that it fronted for. In the film, the organized crime syndicate is depicted as almost a neutral figure that can be won over by Cruise's reasoning and savvy, while the firm itself it depicted as the ultimate evil (HUH?). We never truly feel that Cruise and Tripplehorn are ever in any serious danger and that, coupled with the staggering pace and running time, gives us no rooting interest in the outcome. And when the outcome is as weak as it is here, one is just as happy not to wait around for it.The score sounds like low-rent jazz and often detracts even further from the ""action"".This production is a veritable textbook on how not to adapt a popular page-turner. A lumbering, tortuous, joyless mess devoid of tension, suspense, excitement or any recognizable human emotion. Even the most undiscerning viewers will find themselves looking at their watches and tapping their feet prior to the halfway mark. A complete misfire and a total dud - this film is indeed painful."
The Firm,29-Feb-12,"Mitch McDeere is a brilliant young law student, happily married husband, and—despite some shady family ties—has a bright, ambitious future in the legal community. About to graduate from Harvard in the top five of his class, he agrees to join Bendini, Lambert & Locke, a prestigious Memphis law firm that makes him an offer he can't refuse. All of his dreams seem to be coming true, but he quickly learns that his new firm isn't as virtuous as it seems. Based on the novel by John Grisham the film benefits from interesting characters brought to life by an excellent cast, and it effectively builds an atmosphere of suspense and intrigue, but they're marred by the film's long running time, an odd (and inappropriate) score, and a third act that runs around before finally arriving at a resolution that's much too pat. Highly watchable, but only if you can accept the obvious flaws. **½"
The Firm,16-Sep-00,"My all-time top-rated film; this one has it all.  The characters, not just the leads, are real and substantive.  Hackman almost steals the show. Cruise takes you with him as a young comer with the world before him: brains, energy, confidence, a beautiful wife (Tripplehorn, who is gorgeous, sensuous, supportive and yet strongly her own person), and a dream job. Cruise and Tripplehorn sizzle throughout the movie, but never more so than in the penultimate scene when he repeatedly asks ""Have I lost you?""  Her answer simply melts the heart.The writing is of course superb, and, although the ending, different from the book, has been criticized, I found it an amazing extrication from a situation which compels the viewer to believe is hopeless.  You want the stars to somehow escape their continually worsening plight - both within their personal lives together and with the evil external forces that have ensnared them, and the movie ending does not disappoint.Disappointing, however are the last few moments, which are disjointed and seem to belong to another movie.  It amazes me that something better could not have been done.  It could only have been worse had our heros ridden into a sunset to the strumming of a western guitar ..."
The Firm,18-Jan-20,It's supposed to be a thriller/action/mystery of this FIRM... But in every built up scene they play this happy go lucky jolly piano that doesn't go with the movie in the slightest. I mean maybe once or twice. But after the 20th time of hearing it in spots where it doesn't belong.. It's downright ANNOYING!!!! Rating would be higher if not for the worst soundtrack decision in movie history!
The Firm,12-Aug-09,"this is a very smart thriller from Sydney Pollack, his directing too. the mystery and tense feeling in this film really won me over.the film stars a fairly young Tom Cruise as a man trying to join a law firm. when he finds the law firm that makes his dreams come true all isn't what it seems. the film also stars Gene Hackman, Jeanne Tripplehorn, Ed Harris and Holly Hunter.... they all do a good job with the acting in this filmthe thing i hated about this which made me give it an 8/10 instead of a 9 or possibly 10 is the musical score....... its terrible and annoying. when i watch films in order for it to get a 9 or a 10 it has to be almost or fully perfect and this isn't just for the musicits a long, exciting and mysterious thriller. its awesome........ 8/10.........j.d Seaton"
The Firm,16-Feb-02,"An excellent triller in which intelligence is more important than guns or violence in winning against an enemy much more stronger! Tom Cruise during the movie is able to loose his ""brave-kid"" face and Gene Hackman is very clever as usual"
The Firm,12-Nov-03,"The movie The Firm was OK but really cannot compare to the book. There were a few things that were very different and many parts played like one long action sequence. The book is a masterpiece and although the movie is certainly watchable it is a bit dull at times. The book existed on incredible tension, drama and great dialogue. It was simply riveting all the way through. The movie was less like a drama/psychological thriller and more, at times, like an (action movie?).There was nothing wrong with Cruise as Mc.Deere. He looks like what I'd picture Mitch to look like anyway from the book. But I am baffled as to why this was not left alone and done exactly as the book was. After all, the book was a major success-there's gotta be a reason. Gristham is such an amazing story teller that I don't know if this could have been successfully adapted to a movie but as movie thrillers go it wasn't at all dreadful but was just alright. But Just lacked a certain something and I gotta say it again, it would have been better to stick to the book (exactly). The changes they made in the movie didn't work.(won't give any spoilers.) Also to many corny chase scenes substituting for real suspense that was so prevalent in the book. only slightly above average movie-READ GRISTHAM'S BOOK-MUCH BETTER!"
Moana,24-Feb-20,"Like most adults, I came to view this film as a result of having two small children. However, I was very pleasantly surprised by the film, and my kids loved it.Let me start by saying that the original music for the film was outstanding. When watching Disney, you expect it to be good, but the soundtrack is amazing. The animation in the film was also what you'd expect from Disney...superb.Now as far as the plot goes. You have a heroine, and what I feel is the first real heroine in all of the animated films that I've watched. Most films make a forced effort to show girls that they can also excel and be whoever they choose. Moana takes a girl, who's also a princess by the way but an ordinary one, and allows her to truly explore, achieve, and save the world not through magic, extraordinary power or luck, but through hard work and perseverance. She is real. Maui is also the perfect comic relief and the Rock does an excellent job in this roll.My kids want to watch it again and so do I."
Moana,18-Dec-17,"I love everything about this movie. The colors, the setting and the characters, all good to my eyes!"
Moana,29-Dec-17,"As an individual double majoring in Computer Science and Creative Writing (with a focus on screenplays) I have to say that Moana was one of the best Disney Movies that I have ever watched! In fact, I was astonished by its storyline along with its animations that it became one of my favorite movies and ended up buying my own Moana doll for Christmas!SPOILERS: In particular, I truly enjoyed the scenes where Moana gained the confidence to go out there and voyage into the sea even though her dad Tui wanted her to focus on being the chief for her people. The first time she went out didn't end so well (I was laughing so hard when Moana's Grandma said that whatever she did that she blamed in on the pig, Pua, which in fact, is one of the most adorable characters that Disney has ever created!), but I admire the confidence that she showed. This confidence showed me that we as individuals are truly individuals. I also loved the scene where Maui was trying to turn into the Hawk when he and Moana were trying to get the hook from Tamatoa's shell. It was hilarious to see him turn from a fish, to a shark, then a chameleon etc, then finally back to his human form. It made it even funnier when Tamatoa was saying that Maui was having trouble with his look as he was singing ""Shiny.""All and all, I can't think of anything wrong with this movie. This is one of the Disney Movies that I can watch over and over again!"
Moana,05-Mar-17,"Moana is a return to the classic Disney formula, the clichés and characters ripped from a number of other animated films. However, the pure beauty and skill of the production rises the old story into new heights.Following from the success of Zootropolis, Moana follows a more traditional narrative we know and love; the princess who wishes for something more and is whisked on a supernatural adventure. We know this story so well yet Moana seems fresh and thrilling as if the plot was innovative. Perhaps this is due to the Polynesian setting or the morally ambiguous Maui, played perfectly by Dwayne Johnson, but most likely it is it the simple magic of Disney – the wonder for both children and adults has reached its peak with the perfection of the classic formula. For once, the clichés make the film more enjoyable. The quality of the animation helps too: it's clear they have reached the pinnacle of blending realistic textures with stylised designs, creating an aesthetic beauty that few other companies can match – Disney have mastered water to the point it looks better animated than in real life! Even the music has been perfected here, the annoying catchiness of Frozen's tunes replaced by memorable but effective songs that fit the culture and setting of our adventure. A childlike warmth was awakened in me and many other adult members of the audience as the film brought the emotional highs of the Disney renaissance without the modern subversion of the classic tropes. While Moana sometimes threatens this with pop culture references, the film thankfully keeps to mostly traditional values and morals; a step above many children's animated films released today.Moana is good, old fashioned Disney magic; the traditional narrative and morals updated with stellar animation and an awareness that's effective but never overpowering enough to threaten the integrity of the Disney formula.SWEETVisit https://sweetorsaltedmoviereviews.com/ for more."
Moana,08-Feb-17,"Wow, what a great great movie! The visuals in this movie are breathtaking!! They are so gorgeous! But, besides the visuals there is such a heart and imagination and creativity to this movie. Moana is such a likable, smart, and relatable person. the voice work for Moana is so sweet and so good. The chemistry between Moana and Maui is so great and so natural. The songs in this movie are so charming, catchy and fun! But, How Far I'll Go is such an emotional song and it has such heart...I dare say I like it a little more than Let It Go! The way Moana sings it and you can feel it!! Wow, I just looved this movie and it is great for kids and adults. I will always love it and I wanna see it again!"
Moana,05-Dec-16,"Instant classic.Easily ranks among the best from the Disney Studio, and a very worthy successor to Mulan 1998, a similar story equally well done.Oddly also seems to be best work ever from Dwayne Johnson, perhaps not the first name I would have associated with ""voice acting,"" but a star turn nonetheless.If you want to be picky -- which is the reviewer's job, after all -- the momentum slows a little at the top of the third act, but the ultimate themes of redemption, forgiveness and self-discovery at the finale are an absolute joy.As they used to say, ""for children of all ages."""
Moana,06-Dec-16,"Tell me if you've seen this movie:Princess wants to do something a parent doesn't want her to do. Close friend/relative inspires her to be/do it anyway. Princess meets wacky sidekick. Prince and wacky sidekick don't get along but are forced to work together. Princess and wacky sidekick bond. Conflict happens and princess and wacky sidekick part ways. Princess continues on. Wacky sidekick shows up out of nowhere to help princess. Princess and wacky sidekick win, become friends forever. Parent realizes they were wrong, encourages princess to be/do whatever.I felt like I already knew the plot to this film because I had seen it 100 times before. Why didn't I rate it lower? Because it's visually stunning. The style of this film is very unique and I like the way they wove Samoan artistic sense into it. I found myself mesmerized at the water effects and the animals more than anything else.Fun for kids, but nothing you haven't seen before."
Moana,03-Jan-17,"2016 has been a particularly strong year for animated films. With the likes of Zootopia, Finding Dory and Kubo & The Two Strings all vying for best animated picture of the year, it seems Moana deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as well. It's no fluke that out of the four movies I just mentioned, 3 of them belong under the house of the mouse.Legend has it that demigod Maui stole a sacred stone, the heart of the goddess Te Fiti. The lava demon confronted him and both the heart and Maui were lost forever. Now, the world is slowly dying and someone must find the heart and force Maui to put it back. But who is this chosen one? It might be Moana, a Polynesian girl who is suppose to be taking over as chief of her tribe, but longs to sail beyond the reef. Featuring new comer Auli'i Carvalho as Moana and the most electrifying man in sports entertainment, Dwayne 'The Rock"" Johnson, as the demigod Maui. It's not surprising that I found myself tapping my feet to the songs in this film because Lin-Manuel Miranda, creator of Hamilton, shares his talent with this film. I can easily see any one of the songs in this piece going up for and winning Best Original Song, giving the man the O in the prestigious PEGOT award circle. He currently has a Pulitzer, Emmy, Tony and Grammy, among more. The songs here remind me of the old-school Disney songs, easy to listen to, fun to play on repeat and important to the story. At first, I felt it was a little too on the nose with some of the lyrics, but eventually he won me over and I've been listening to the soundtrack ever since. The film itself might lack some of the intricacies of plot heavy films like Zootopia, but this journey story is entertaining and heartfelt. The vibrant colours of the green islands and the blue sea help propel the film above and beyond what some others films have to offer. The animation takes a nice little turn for the creative when the characters find themselves under the sea in a side villains lair. We are treated with some bioluminescent sequences with another catchy tune not far behind. Johnson is stellar as Maui, he seems completely comfortable in a voice acting role and surprisingly has the chops to sing a tune. Newcomer Auli'i Carvalho holds her own against a star like Johnson and she really gives a strong voice to a driven female character. I applaud that Disney didn't feel the need to shoehorn in a love story either. This is a tale about self discovery, not some young woman needing to find a man. Disney nods and respects their past while looking to the future with Moana. Princesses no longer need to be the 'love' goal of a man. Moana is a visually beautiful film with great songs and a strong female lead character. There are some visually gags for the kids and a great time for adults. Moana is a great film."
Moana,27-Feb-17,"From the opening lyrics to the final shot, Moana was a fun glimpse into Polynesian life. Reminds me of Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron with its depiction of tribal peoples, people who depend on the land and environment to live. As one of the several catchy songs say, the island gives them everything they need. No need to go beyond the reef.I'm glad that Moana and Zootopia, Disney's two most recent feature films, humorously refer to the archetypal Disney traits that appear in film after film -- i.e. an animal sidekick, the heroine bursting into song, following your dreams. Even if they do year after year, it never gets old. (... Well, maybe a little bit. I'm actually jaded by the happy ending trope in practically every work of film, literature, etc. out there. But that's beside the point.) Even if you can predict the ending of Moana, it's not quite what you expected. Disney has recently been changing things up a bit and having creative endings. Frozen, for example. Even if they weren't slightly creative, the story still enacts the Disney magic -- the ability to inspire, motivate, uplift, and ultimately enlighten further on mankind's communal desire to go beyond the norm. You don't have to do something amazing to make a name for yourself. It's not the hook that defines you, it's what you do that defines you and makes you who you are. Just don't follow hard tradition all the time. If someone says you can't achieve your dreams, he/she is most likely right. HOWEVER. That's only true if you don't give it your all. Those right now who are living their dreams gave it their all. If it's something you really want, after all, then naturally you'll give it the necessary effort and force of will. It won't be easy; life wasn't meant to be easy.It's not as amazing as Zootopia, but Moana is still a genuinely good Disney movie. It has a superb single, a nice accompanying soundtrack, great characters, sublime animation with crystal- clear attention to detail, and wonderful themes and messages. I admit, I was expecting too much from Moana after seeing Zootopia, which is probably why I give Moana a 9. Zootopia hits the 10. If you haven't seen either one, I recommend seeing Moana first."
Moana,21-Feb-17,"Henny's Movie Review: Moana (aka Vaiana)In three words: A Fun Movie.With Pixar dropping the ball lately it is good to see that Disney is picking it up with great movies like, Tangled, Zootopia and now Moana. Yes, they made a mediocre over-hyped movie named Frozen, read my previous review for my thoughts about that movie. Moana really doesn't disappoint it has a good pacing, a great cast, and it is BEAUTIFUL. I could just leave my review at this and tell you to go and watch this movie, but let's see ""How Far I'll Go"".Moana is a story that takes place in Ancient Polynesia, when a curse reaches the island Mata Nui a chieftain's daughter is determined to go on a journey, to find a demigod named Maui in order to stop the curse.Like most Disney movies this is a coming of age story. Moana is a chieftain's daughter who is struggling with her love for her people and her love for the ocean. She is determined and a strong character. It is wonderful to see her grow and find herself throughout the movie. She is voiced by Auli'I Cravaljo and it fits like a glove, perfect love her accent. Moana is joined by a demigod named Maui. He starts out as an egotistical/funny character but we quickly learn why and see him change for the better. He is voiced by Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson and if you know The Rock YOU know what to expect. You can never go wrong with The Rock.Other supporting characters were there to setup the plot and exposition.The music, as expected, was typically Disney which is a good thing because I love Disney songs. After the movie you just can't get it out of your head. All the scores were very good. It did the basics like underscoring a scene but it also carried the movie for a huge part.The three-act-structure. Moana has a great beginning, good middle, and a great ending. Furthermore, the pacing of this movie is fast in a good way. It doesn't hold on to a scene for too long and the movie knows when to cut.The cinematography was beautiful it really shows that the creators have done their research. I love the bright colors and gorgeous sceneries. It would appear that Disney's new approach to movie making is starting to pay-off, by remaking their old animated movies into real-life and mocking their old movies with their new 3d-animated movies, they are breathing new life into their movies. As aforementioned in the introduction Moana is a must see movie that won't disappoint.I give this movie a 8.5."
Moana,19-Mar-17,"I have been largely unimpressed with Disney's recent animated movies, and many of my criticisms with them hold true with Moana. Looking back at Wreck-It Ralph, Zootopia, and Frozen, it seems to me that Disney is more interested in building a visually beautiful world than building a great story. This is true with Moana. The animation is wonderful. The world is gorgeous. The story, however, is rather dull and shallow.The world is by design fairly sparse. There aren't a lot of characters in this movie. So to make up for that, the story or the characters need to be particularly compelling. Unfortunately, they aren't.Disney breaks no new ground with Moana's story. That isn't new for Disney, and to be fair, it isn't necessarily a bad thing. Many good movies are just well-done re-imaginings of classic stories. But Moana isn't even that. At every step of the way, I couldn't shake a feeling that I'd seen it all before. The story never gripped me nor did it leave me feeling fulfilled. Thus, the film just feels empty.If either Moana or Maui were engaging characters, this movie could have been good. Despite a good performance from Auli'i Cravalho, Moana had a very small character arc. She was not that different a person at the end of the film than she was at the beginning. For much of the film, she had very little agency of her own. The plot seemed to carry her along, rather than she driving the plot.Maui did everything he could to cause the plot to stall. This could have been great, as his antagonistic attempts to stop the main character could have worked as the central conflict. But since Moana is rarely actually trying to move the plot forward, the conflict just seems to be her-vs-him, which is mildly interesting at best.It's a shame. Moana could have been such a good movie. But it suffers from the same failings as most recent Disney animated ventures: wonderfully crafted world without a story worthy of that world."
Moana,04-Feb-17,"I saw ""Moana"" tonight in the local movie theater. I have been wanting to see it since Thanksgiving and expected the audience to be few. To my amazement the cinema was almost full, and I can see why. ""Moana"" is a fabulous movie--it will certainly leave you crying and smiling. I would imagine most of the folks in the audience now have seen it 3 or 4 times. I served a number of years in the Army in Hawaii, so I was attracted to the movie for that reason, and it was certainly a great movie going experience. The animated graphics capture the magic and beauty of Polynesia, the land and the ocean. And the story is a lot of fun. Highly recommended for all ages."
Moana,28-Dec-16,"So I watched Moana and boy, what a lazy movie it was. So full of good ideas, squandered on a passable family movie. And yes, I know it's Disney making a family movie, but it had all these ideas that would make a great story if they were taken more seriously. The premise of the movie is basically the whole world dying because of what someone did and they treat this catastrophic event as an annoyance instead of something actually serious.The protagonist is Moana, an absolutely average Disney princess type of character that wants to say no to being stuck in a life of safety and luxury. We've seen it a thousand times by now, it's nothing that stands out or even something logical in the long run since these types of sheltered characters do not know anything about the outside world and are in effect useless on their own.And I have to point this out about her which is one of the many things they didn't bother to clarify. Why is everybody fine with a girl being their leader? Do they have gender equality on this otherwise primitive island? If they do, they never showed it because any other leader we see in their history was a guy. Combined with how she doesn't drown 1 minute after going into the sea with zero experience further proves this movie is empowerment fantasy for little girls instead of a movie where talent and intelligence matter.But it's OK because the scriptwriter did his worst to plot armor her from any possible danger. Because you see, the gods chose her to be the one who restores the world, thus every time she falls in water, a magical wave takes her on the boat. When she doubts her abilities, the ghosts of her ancestors appear to motivate her. She is essentially a plot device fully controlled by the plot instead of doing what she wants and facing the repercussions of her mistakes.And if you think calling her the chosen one properly excuses all the nonsense, it doesn't because the gods make no sense. Why did they wait a thousand years to do something about a disaster that has killed most of the islands, and of all people why did they choose a little girl with no skills or experience of the outside world? They never explain it.Do you know what else they didn't explain? Why her pet pig doesn't grow up. She begins as a little girl and grows up to a teenager, but the damn thing remains a piglet throughout the whole movie. Nobody in the production team gave a damn.The problems don't even stop there. The first thing she has to do is find Maui, a demigod who has been stuck on a barren island for a thousand years and is the only person who can save the world. He is also the one who doomed it, so that makes sense. Also, for a guy who spent a millennium all alone without something to eat or do on a tiny island, he sure looked fine when she appeared. Disney went so safe and lazy on him that he is nothing but a cool guy who does cool things and has absolutely no sex drive, or psychological trauma for being left alone all this time.Accompanying them on their journey is a retarded chicken. It's the most annoying comic relief animal I have seen in my life. It's not funny, it causes more trouble than aid, and they never eat it although they never seem to have enough food. How the hell did it get on the boat in the first place? Moana didn't take it with her, it just appeared out of nowhere in the secret cave nobody had been in for centuries. Nobody in the production team gave a damn.You probably think I am being too harsh on what is supposed to be a dumb movie for kids, when I'm not since they clearly put effort in fleshing out the characters in a way that demands from the story to be better. Moana's father has a good reason for not letting her out in the sea. Maui has a good reason for why he keeps going on adventures and tries to impress the mortals. Even the villain of the movie has a reason for why she is evil. These are really good stuff, and they are ruined by the lazy script.If the movie was like that in all its aspects, I wouldn't be bothered by it. But when you set it up in a way that obviously raises the bar like that, the disappointment multiplies when you treat your good ideas like a joke. I can easily sum up all these problems as cheap resolutions. Everything is fixed way too fast despite the problems building up for countless years. The father changed his mind way too fast and lets his daughter sail in the sea, Maui changed his mind and returned to help her without even showing us how, and the goddess forgives Maui instantly, despite causing her pain and suffering for a thousand years, as well as wiping out the life of countless islands and filling the sea with monsters. Hell, even the disease that was slowly killing the islands went away in a few seconds despite spreading slowly for centuries.This movie is so freaking lazy. The pay-off is not worth the build-up, its ideas are not used properly, and all you end up getting is a generic Disney princess and a retarded chicken."
Moana,12-Apr-17,"Oh... my... word...A girl wants to go where her dad won't let her, wants to do what her dad won't let her. Hmm.. sound familiar? Little Mermaid, Aladdin, Poca... Pocahontas, Mulan, Brave and just about every modern Disney. Let's look at gender then Disney, seeing as you're OBSESSED with it:Male characters: Dad - scared, repressive, short-sighted, wrong. Demi-God chap - selfish, conceited, vain, ineffective, emotionally repressed, thief. Crab - as above (I'm assuming he's male). Coconut Pirates - murderous but ineffectual (I'm assuming their male).Female characters: Moana - bright eyed, aspirational, quick learner, visionary, empathetic, brave, strong, amazing, indefatigable, indomitable, perceptive. Granny - as above plus supernaturally gifted. Earth Goddess thingy - was only trying to kill people because the male character had robbed her of her precious.Yawn. Increasingly Disney is working as a SJW - righting perceived inbalances in society. They have obviously perceived a gender imbalance biased towards males in society and have therefore produced their own version of the world where the gender imbalance is biased heavily and totally towards the females. Everything else in the film is nice ."
Moana,15-Apr-17,"I really appreciated the tribal basis of this animation. I think they should make more of this type of animation and less Disney Princess based ones. Moana was a very well represented cultural animation. I loved the fact that their facial features and body structure were not all lean and straight or small nosed. It brings a kind if realness that the rest of us can relate to. I loved the plot as well so much, there was a point I actually got chills all over. I can't remember how many times I've re-watched it."
Moana,04-Jan-17,"EDIT: Fixed a couple of grammatical errors, elaborated a bit in one section.Let me be honest with you: there have only really been 3 Disney movies in this year and 10 years included and before it that really made me go ""Wow! They DIDN'T just pull another Disney here"". I say that very rarely because Disney has a particular formula that they know works and will give them loads of money... and BOY do they use it allot. If you don't believe me, think for a second: besides Wreck it Ralph, Zootopia, and Big Hero 6, what other PURE Disney (in no association with Pixar) animated movies HAVEN'T had numerous musical numbers, a female lead, a male supporting role, a comedic relief character, and some big journey to stop something bad from happening to the place that the main character lives in?I know it sounds oddly specific, but it's been played so many times by Disney that's actually more mundane at this point. You've seen in in allot of their hits, and by the next, you probably go into the theater telling yourself the same thing as the last: ""I'm ready for the new masterpiece!"". Moana is just another one of these films. Is it well written? Yes! Is it culturally diverse? Why would it not be? Is the animation beautiful and breathtaking at moments? Again, the answer is a resounding YES. While all those things are a saving grace for the film, the biggest issue I have in my mind with it is that I will probably forget it's existence in the years to come, Oscar, Golden Globe, WHATEVER, or not! Moana is excellently produced, but none of that matters to me when the writing and overall story arc basically amount to clichés that have been beaten to death already. ""Oh,"" I can hear you saying, ""but they mock those cliches, therefore it's original!"" Satire and self-loathing have been around for years. When it comes to the former, there's a line between making fun of something and indulging in the exact thing you're aiming to mock. Moana dives head first into the latter.Listen, if you LOVE Disney and couldn't give a Rat's Tail about these clichés, go ahead and go see the film, you'll probably love it because it's Disney. That said, however, if you DO care for more than a small amount of originality like I do, then maybe it's worth a rental, but that's about it. Again, Moana is excellently produced and will most likely leave a smile on your face... but it's also a convincing case study for all the clichés Disney has been stuffing into their films as of late."
Moana,17-Dec-16,"This film is an epic in the truest sense and easily one of Disney's best ""Big Films"".It follows the classic ""quest"" type story of a girl growing up feeling she's destined for more than her quiet life and eventually finding she's the chosen one to go on a mission to save the world, but how it gets there is awe inspiring.The animation is second to none, at one point I had to do a double take that they didn't mix in a live action character. Thinking back to the original Toy Story, things have certainly come far.Unlike other Disney movies (and most movies in fact), Moana is perfectly capable of pursuing her goals completely by herself and doesn't have a love interest, which I think may be a first for a Disney film (it's actually a lot closer to a Miyazaki film in the way the hero is portrayed).The soundtrack is also exceptional, so much so that my 5 year old girl made me order the album after the film. The entire score evokes a sense of adventure and riding over the waves and is simply sublime.To sum up how good this film is, it was the second movie in which I've ever witnessed the theatre audience erupting into a round of applause when the credits rolled (the first was Interstellar).The movie no doubt has some flaws, but I'm giving it a 10 to balance out some unreasonably negative reviews on here, some of which read like they were written by people who have no seen the movie."
Moana,03-Dec-16,"A friend and I went with the kids to watch Moana last night. I loved seeing Polynesian islands in animation again. The scenery is beautiful--much more of it, and more vivid compared to Lilo and Stitch. The storyline was typical Disney, of course. I feel like I've seen this movie a dozen times before. I would add that I am getting tired of seeing male characters portrayed as cowardly, ignorant, and/or irresponsible. This movie succeeds in that aspect, which is disappointing. Having sons, it would be nice to see a movie where a young man is the hero. Instead, we seem to find thattoo many of Disney's children's movies feature a heroine with weak male characters around her. Other than the above-mentioned observation and the glorifying of pagan belief systems, it was an entertaining and uplifting movie."
Moana,23-Nov-16,"Another typical Disney movie of princess, magic, spells, curses, and CONFUSION. I wont spoil it but if you like musical girlie types like FRozen then you'll probably love this. Otherwise, trust me you will be like whats going on? Why is this taking so long? get to the point already. It just drags and drags and drags. It is also somewhat predicable..you'll see what i mean if you go see this. But i HIGHLY recommend you Don't waste your time and money on this movie. If you really want to see it that bad..wait for the DVD...trust me it isn't worth it. At one point in the movie even The Rock says please stop singing. Two good things i can say. The short story before the movie started was outstanding. Its called Inner Workings. Absolutely amazing and well done. Moana also exhibits incredible computer animation. Other than that IT IS A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. I warned you!"
Moana,31-Dec-16,"Animation is good (except surely not all Polynesians are so stocky and have such large cankles???). I liked the Moana character and her outfit was cute. Maui not so much, such an overblown caricature it was ridiculous!!! My 9 year old granddaughter thought his moving tattoos were silly. She and her 7 year old brother enjoyed it OK, but I doubt if they would want to see it again. I know I don't!! The plot was formulaic and none of the characters (except Moana) were memorable. I don't recall any memorable songs, either. The movie needed a MUCH better plot and more in-depth characters. Go back to the drawing board, Disney!! Some of my granddaughter's old Barbie movies (like ""Pegasus"") had better and more memorable stories!!"
Moana,30-Nov-16,"Personally, I thought this movie was boring, so boring to where there were only a couple jokes I found somewhat funny the entire movie, yes this is one of those more song driven movies that are with very little humor, it also appeared as the people I went with(which one of them was a little kid who was laying on one of our arms for half the movie and it wasn't late either, it started at like 12:50 PM I think) wasn't that into it either. First, about the first hour before she got on her adventure was extremely boring, not much was happening and it was all just her not wanting to go, actually during this time, I was so bored, that I went to the bathroom and took my time(usually I run to get back to the movie) and when I got out, I actually got on my phone and looked at how ""bad"" the reviews would be for this movie, it turns out I was very wrong, it has very good reviews and I was surprised. When I got back in there, a little later it got slightly more interesting after she got on her boat, but it still was pretty boring, I even went to the bathroom a second time even though I probably could've held it. I don't think I've been to a more boring movie in my life, the songs seemed pretty generic and I know at least 1 repeated itself later on the movie. I personally didn't care for Frozen either though which I think is the market this is aimed for. This is honestly making me start to lose hope in Disney, I think they've done messed up TV, and now they're messing up movies it seems. I think it is overrated but that's just my opinion. All I can say is that if you like Frozen, you'd probably like this movie. But if you didn't care for Frozen, you'd probably find this one of the most boring movies of your life. I don't even think it's me outgrowing cartoons, I like cartoons but this is just boring, I think it may be they're all aimed for little kids(probably little girls for this one) now, whatever happened to family movies. This movie was so boring, that I was literally able to tell what kind of plot it has, it has a Hero's Journey plot in case you're wondering, I know a lot of movies have the plot, but it's not supposed to be this plain obvious to where I can tell either while or right after I watched the movie. I also think this being about some fictional religion was just weird, like how were the islanders in trouble when the darkness was like halfway around the world, then why would that goddess be that thing that was trying to kill them, it would make more since if we could've saved 10 minutes by her just saying to give her the thing then and that she was the goddess but no, gotta make it obvious about that Hero's Journey plot, seriously. So overall I wouldn't recommend this movie to hardly anyone unless they like Frozen and I personally find this movie very overrated."
Moana,08-Mar-18,"Set on the Polynesian islands of the South Pacific. 2016's 'Moana', explore the expedition of a young woman, Moana (Voiced by Auli'i Cravalho), who is chosen by the ocean itself to reunite a mystical life-breathing relic with an island goddess, Te Fiti, when it was stolen by the Demigod Maui (Voiced by Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson). Without spoiling this fictional movie written and directed by John Musker and Ron Clements, too much; though the film heavily influenced by Polynesian's history, myths, & culture, it is not directly based on any specific native tribe like the 1926's documentary film of the same name. Instead, the film takes specific cultural elements from a variety of native Pacific groups and incorporates them into one generalized portrayal of Polynesian culture, in order to make the audience member to identity the story better. Because of that, certain critics has accuse Disney of cultural misappropriation & exploitation, suitable to spur a profitable capitalist enterprise of music, celebrities and merchandise. While, this is somewhat true. I don't think, Disney had much of a choice. They had to avoid setting off cultural taboos. It was lose-lose catch 22 situation. Somebody was bound to get offended, regardless. However, I don't think, this musical is as degrading as certain people make it out to be. It's pretty harmless, compare to other tropical musicals like 1958's 'South Pacific' whom portray its island people as ugly snake oil-sellers, hags who gives give away their really young daughters to military servicemen to screw. If anything, 'Moana' gives a more positive light. Still, some of the characters of the film were drawn, very insensitive. Maui did look like an obese ""half pig half hippo"" man. He did look kinda offensive. Still, much of that blame, come from the Walt Disney Animation Studios animators trying to lighten their load, by replicate the same awkward-looking art style that their 2002's animation film 'Lilo & Stich' was doing, over 14 years ago. Even back then, not a lot of people were fans of the big nose, the huge tights, oddly body structure, and alien-like eyes, type of a drawing for islanders. So, I really don't know, why they try to copy it. I guess, they wanted to focus more on other drawings like the supernatural elements designs. Even with that, those drawings also felt a little too familiar. If anything, the spirits looks like Disney recycling artwork that was previous, used in films like 2000's 'Fantasia 2000' & 2014's 'Lava'. As for animal sidekicks. As much as I love Hei Hei (Voiced by Alan Tudyk) & Pua. They really weren't needed. It did felt, unneeded animation. Despite that, at least, the island CGI background visuals for 'Moana' were breath-taking beautiful. There is no better example of that, then the 'Where you are' & 'We Know the Way', musical sequences. The other visuals like the action sequences, were equally done well. I just wish this Polynesian Prometheus/Odyssey-like fantasy story was told a little better to match the visuals. The action scenes in this film seem a bit force. Plus, it doesn't make much sense. After all, I get that, Moana was chosen by the water spirit; because how much, she cares about aquatic-life, but it doesn't explain, why the supernatural entity couldn't just do the task, itself. Nor does it explain why, the ocean tries to kill Moana with storms, sea-monsters, and lead them into conflicts with sea raiders, in the course of the film. Did the demigod actions make the ocean, bio-polar, as well? Also, what was the point of even having Maui around? He really doesn't do much; besides put Moana in danger. Let's not overlook that Maui also tried to kill Moana by locking her in a cave to die & trying to drown her in the middle of the ocean. Hero!? He's more like the villain. Another thing about the story, is that much of the flashbacks, book-reading and dream cave sequences could had been cut down in editing. All of them, felt a little too much like filler. The movie tends to repeat itself, multiply times; explaining, how Moana's people were, once- island voyagers, before Maui, cause the ocean to become too dangerous; despite the fact, the ocean, somewhat helps them. All the exposition dump come across, tiresome and very jarring. Another thing, that hurts the movie is the fact that the story of a young native princess tries to break free from the strict confines of her society by seeking out, a mysterious stranger in order to save her land, sounds a little too familiar. After all, we seen heroine's adventures like this, before, in half a dozen, Walt Disney Animation Studios films like 1995's 'Pocahontas'. Even acclaim Pixar films like 2012's 'Brave' had these well-worn elements. Don't get me wrong, it's doesn't make 'Moana' into a bad movie, but its presenting nothing, groundbreaking. In the end, this movie in a couple years, might not stand out, as much, as other films from this generation. Despite that, the movie does offer positive messages for younger viewers, about self-discovery and empowerment. And Moana herself is a great role model, demonstrating perseverance, curiosity, and courage, even when face with danger. Cravalho perform her, very well. She is a great singer and has a passable voice. As for Johnson, not so much. His performance was more mediocre, because how dial down, his personality was. However, Johnson does sings one of the catchiest songs in the movie, ""You're Welcome""; which is a plus. Besides that song, the funniest song is ""Shiny,"" sung by Jemaine Clement; which also really fun to listen to; along with the power ballad, 'How far I'll go'. All great songs, courtesy of creator Lin-Manuel Miranda. All this music, makes 'Moana' soundtrack, worth listening to. Overall: Although. 'Moana' has many big flaws. It still was entertaining. 'Moana' is truly an adventure worth sailing for. So check it out."
Moana,27-Nov-16,"Moana (or Vaiana in my country and many other European countries) is an animated musical adventure directed by John Musker and Ron Clements. It is the second Disney movie this year after the incredible Zootopia that was released back in February, and now I can say it is the second incredible movie released by Disney in 2016. Moana is a very interesting and touching movie about a girl named Moana (Vaiana) who dreams of sailing the world. She is voiced by Auli'i Cravalho who does a fantastic job on the role with her insanely talented voice, singing all the wonderful songs that will very soon be considered as classics. Dwayne Johnson is great (as per usual) as Maui - a legendary shapeshifting demigod. He brings such a fun, lovely, and comforting voice to his character that very few actors can do. And he is great at singing too, which was a surprise for me. It also has great animation, with incredible visuals as we've come to expect in Disney movies nowadays. I truly believe that in this decade, Disney has absolutely taken over the reigns in the film industry, and especially on the animation side of things. With movies like Tangled, Wreck-it Ralph, Frozen, Big Hero 6, Zootopia and now Moana, Disney shows no sign of stopping in their road to greatness and taking over the world."
Moana,15-Dec-16,"The positives: -Great soundtrack. FROZENesque, epic, catchy monologues that repeat in your head. Added with Lion King like incomprehensible but fun tunes with a Hawaiian twist this time. -Beautiful and creative visuals. One in particular I enjoyed a lot was the UNDER underwater world where the ocean served as the sky. The striking beautiful blue/turquoise water with lush green islands were treat for the eyes -No silly, typical Disney, forced romances. -Passes the Bechdel test easilyThe negatives: -Filled with clichés, unoriginal and overused themes, tropes, characters and dialogue etc.... -A lot of trouble with building engagement early on. All over the place with a lot of shifts -Annoyingly predictable, unfunny characters. Specially Maui with such cringe worthy, lame jokes. Maybe i'm too old to be amazed by easy punch lines, that end of the day are meant for kids -difficulty with tonal focus. -unnecessary, out of place scene with coconut pirates that add nothing to the story -lacked the charm and wonder i expect in a kids movie.My rating: -5/10 -Neither original or interesting but has one or two things going for it to be not disregarded. -Compared to other animated family movies this year, I would rank this below Finding Dory but above The Secret Life of Pets."
Moana,06-Dec-16,"So Moana was boring. Not entirely a typical family and kids movie, but still very much in the same vein. It's not very funny, it relies on musical numbers more than it should and those musical numbers are mostly boring or annoying. There's a few good singing parts in it, but it's overshadowed by annoying musical numbers. It relies on pop-culture which is really out of place in a movie that's about Polynesian legends. One of the main characters makes a joke about Twitter in the movie which is completely out of taste and just isn't funny. It's a great visual spectacle, but a poor plot, but would hold up on its own it if wasn't throwing strange out of place jokes and very modern character behavior. I had very high hopes for this movie, and it really was a let down. It was boring, and rather shallow. At best from me a 5/10."
How Do You Know,21-Jan-20,"I'm currently watching this film and honestly, it's so bizarre. These are all incredible actors but in this film... I just don't know what is happening. However, I cannot stop watching it. I just need to understand what the hell is going on and what the aim is. The dialogue between characters are all over the place, not sure if it's supposed to be humourous or not either way I'm not laughing but then again... I am because it's such a ridiculous film lol. Even this review sounds so scrambled because of what this film is doing lol."
How Do You Know,03-Jan-19,"It was winter and i was alone home. I was anticipating there will be no wifi for a couple of days so i had some movies downloaded on my Netflix. Seeing Owen wilson and Paul Rudd on the cast, i thought this movie would be Rom Com. But as i start watching, i found out it's a Romantic Drama with lots of life lessons. I am lucky there was no Internet connection on that afternoon. It's a movie i am gonna suggest to everyone who is having a bad day. I am gonna watch it again."
How Do You Know,26-Mar-11,"From looking at the casting, you would immediately think this to be a romantic comedy, and I guess that's where it starts going wrong.. from people going in to see this movie, expecting a chick flick and being disappointed.I believe the reason for the poor reviews of this movie are due to the fact that is has been advertised and delivered as a romantic comedy.True, it is fit for the romance genre, comedy.. not so much. But as far as romantic drama's go, this is an excellent picture for the modernized crowd.That's because it is so much more. It is ideal for viewing of a well- intended inspiring somewhat-romantic movie. Humour is few and far between for a comedy-seeking crowd, however for those who connect to the characters, the humour is purely intended for those devised from caring for the characters.Reese Witherspoon has perfected the role of Lisa, this is the movie that I would beg girlfriends to watch, due to her total delivery of the character throughout the entire picture, which is something most girls and women can relate to (whether they've reached that hurdle yet or not). Which is where I feel the script originated from, life lessons. The script of the movie is all relatable in one aspect or other. It's moving to view a capture of these 'life lessons' within a movie, and I think if a movie can deliver that, then they have succeeded in making a good movie. Although the writing could have been sharper, better presented and wittier, it was decent enough for one to be indulged in the plot.Paul Rudd, I thought, was a fantastic casting. Again, writing could of been better for a few of his lines where comedy was intended and some of his reactions.. but still I found him to be excellent and I enjoyed watching him.Nice to see Jack Nicholson again, (huge fan of One flew over the cuckoo's nest!), his part was suitable if not a little long winded. I felt (again) wittier writing would have improved his character and performance hugely, however he delivered his part.And Luke Wilson.. okay so we all know what kind of movie's he's known for now, and fair enough, he was a good casting for the part. My only itch is I'd like to see him doing more roles similar to Hutch, ala Starsky&, dry detective types. Moving on, as said above, this is not a movie to make you lol or rofl, merely a movie to be enjoyed from watching these character's journey of self-revelation's throughout."
How Do You Know,03-May-11,"I was expecting to be very disappointed with this film because I'd heard that most people disliked it. I really really liked it. I think that audiences these days have to have a joke every 30 seconds to be entertained. Maybe audiences feel short changed if there isn't a huge obvious wrap up off the plot at the end of the film. I liked that everything wasn't black and white in the film. There are many unanswered questions. The characters' intentions and feelings weren't absolutely clear. That's what I loved about it. It's sad that so many people disliked this film, but I think it's very courageous of James l. Brooks to write a film that pleased him and not have to pace it like most other ""successful"" Hollywood crap movies. This film makes you think unlike many other huge hit comedies these days."
How Do You Know,19-Dec-10,"Greetings again from the darkness. How about a little effort, folks? Writer/Director James L Brooks and Jack Nicholson have teamed up for three far superior films prior to this. Terms of Endearment, Broadcast News, and As Good As it Gets are all insightful dramadies that bring real life into relationships. This is billed as a Rom-Com, but the romance is distant and lame, and the comedy is all but non-existent.The very talented Paul Rudd plays George, son of Charles (Nicholson) who is the target of a federal investigation after his father sets him up by falsifying corporate financial documents. The problem is George is a really nice, honest guy and Charles is a lying scumbag who would throw his son to the federal wolves.In a seemingly unrelated story, Reece Witherspoon plays Lisa, a very talented softball player with an incredible track record and evidently serious skills. She gets cut from the Olympic team because of her advancing age (she will be 31 at the next Olympics). Lisa is dating Matty, played by Owen Wilson. Matty is a $14 million per year major league baseball player, who is also a player off the field.Everyone in this story is so very nice, but screwed up in their own way. That's actually a hopeful start. So one thing leads to another and George falls for Lisa. Lisa moves in with Matty, who lives in the Charles' building. Lisa then moves out. George is always there for Lisa while her life is in shambles. George's life is in shambles too, but all he cares about is Lisa. Any guess how this ends up? Of course you know. This script is not built for surprises. Or romance. Or comedy.The bulk of the comedy comes from a very pregnant Kathryn Hahn as Anne, whose life is also a bit of a mess. She is an unmarried, pregnant assistant to George, who worries about him, her and everything ... but she has such a big heart that she bakes and labels multiple dinners for George.Anyway ... the best part of the film is that we never get subjected to Owen Wilson throwing a pitch or Reese Witherspoon actually playing softball. There is so much talent associated with this film, but it definitely proves the point that the heart of a film is not in the direction or the acting, but in the script. For a similar story line, but far superior film, go re-watch When Harry Met Sally for the eighteenth time. It has comedy and romance and a worthy script."
How Do You Know,20-Aug-12,"When I first saw the trailer for ""How Do You Know"" I thought it looked like a promising rom com, but then I saw the initial reviews for it and steered clear away. It wasn't until my Uncle pushed it on me, ""Didn't that tank?"" ""Yeah, but it's actually good!"" I think the reason why this movie got such bad reviews is people expected the typical rom com (I did). What it is, is a REAL movie, with depth, great characters, smart dialogue, and the complexity of reality, with some jokes and a love story thrown in. Great writing, superb acting. Don't know what else to say. Found it intriguing that on further review, my ""go to"" critics didn't review this one. One of the better films I've seen this year. Would give it an 8, but to right a wrong, giving it a 10."
How Do You Know,17-Jan-11,"I am very critical of slow pacing but did not find this comedy the least bit slow. As one who works on Wall Street, I can tell you that people like George actually do exist (promoted to a position of authority due to nepotism, but set up for a fall because he actually has ethics). I thought the way they set things up with the phone call by Reba, the pragmatic selfishness of his current girlfriend, and the non-date date worked well together and was plausible enough within context to be enjoyable. I also thought the relationship between jock-player (Wilson) and over-the-hill jock Witherspoon was sweet and funny in its own way.However, Kathryn Hahn steals every scene she's in as Rudd's personal assistant who hates what's going on and is also a single mom-to-be. And her scene in the hospital alone was worth the price of admission to me. The ending was also well handled. This is the best Paul Rudd performance I have seen since The Shape of Things after many bad ones in-between. Witherspoon was fine even though she didn't seem to have sizzling chemistry with Rudd - she was wonderful with Wilson. The cameo by Shalhoub as a psychiatrist was hilarious. And Mark-Linn Baker was appropriately cowering as the corporate lawyer. Nicholson was fine - he felt the part even though he could have played it in his sleep. Not one of his best, but more than adequate.So, is this an original and ground-breaking film? No. Is it a highly enjoyable romantic comedy with good supporting performances and funny scenes? Yes!"
How Do You Know,14-Sep-12,"How Do You Know is a romantic comedy that stars Reese Witherspoon, Paul Rudd, Owen Wilson and Jack Nicholson.The movie centers on the story of a passionate athlete who finds herself romantically torn between a narcissistic baseball star and a straight-laced businessman.It was directed, written and produced by James L. Brooks. Lisa (Witherspoon) has sports been the definition of her life. Then, in the blink of an eye, she's cut from the team due to age and decline of skills. With her identity in crisis as she attempts to regain her footing in life,she begins dating Matty (Wilson),a Major League Baseball pitcher and notorious womanizer. Meanwhile, terminally honest businessman George (Rudd) finds himself on the road to financial ruin or worse after being wrongly implicated in a financial crime. As he struggles to clear his name and reconcile his turbulent relationship with his father, Charles (Nicholson);a chance meeting with Lisa at the lowest point in both of their lives leaves him optimistic that things may work out after all. Meanwhile, Lisa and George both realize that the only thing that's certain about the future is that we never know what fate has in store for us.The film fails due to the fact that it is in the romantic comedy genre and it is neither romantic nor comic.It hardly generates any laughs despite the talent involved like Witherspoon and Nicholson.What's worse,there is no resolution involved in the relationship between George and Lisa except the fact that only the future knows what's in store for them.Everything was just left hanging in the air just like how they got attracted to each other except for experiencing bad things in life.It could have worked better if the screenplay addressed the connection between them instead of simply putting it as a plot requirement and nothing more."
How Do You Know,27-Apr-20,"This comedy-drama starring Reese Witherspoon, Paul Rudd, and Owen Wilson directed by James R. Brooks offers up a romantic triangle that at its core is a serious, cerebral look at relationships with strong humorous overtones. Unlike Reese Witherspoon's romantic triangle in This Means War an action, comedy thriller two years later, Witherspoon's character in How Do You Know is much more involved and three-dimensional. This film is for some unsettling with unresolved subplots, especially when it comes to Witherspoon's career. And unlike the more acceptable as well as delightfully twisty romantic comedy triangle of My Girlfriend's Boyfriend (2010) with Alyssa Milano, How Do You Know presents two credible suitors but whose relationship with Witherspoon's character is both convoluted, quite well executed and realistic yet somewhat unsatisfactorily resolved and off-putting. At the same time, it is just this uneasy sense of denouement that makes this movie critically stronger and more substantive, if not plainly audience pleasing. For those looking for an extended look at romantic relationships involving two credible male characters that may recall one's own relational conflicts and torments, this movie puts you in the middle of it all."
How Do You Know,15-Sep-18,"I've always wanted to watch this film as I like all the main artists. But I've always avoided it because of the low rating. What a shame! It's a well written story, portrayed by great artists. There were funny scenes so I don't get why many complained it was not funny. It also had memorable heartwarming moments. But my favorite aspect about this film is how the messages it want to convey are not smacked on the viewers' face. They were subtly delivered, allowing the viewers to relish them and form their own thought. At least that was my experience.My real rating is 8. But I think it is unfair that a gem like this is underrated so I'd give it a 10."
How Do You Know,13-Jan-11,"This is the best performance yet by the wonderful Paul Rudd, a return to form for Owen Wilson, and the first truly sexy turn by Reese Witherspoon, always an excellent actress but never this yummy heretofore. James L. Brooks has a skilled and expert hand with pace and performance, and the movie is funny and unusually thoughtful--too thoughtful, perhaps, for some of the ADD-afflicted people who post here. This is a worthy addition to the very short list of great romantic comedies, and one which will grow in reputation through the years. Jack Nicholson is committed and inventive--perhaps a bit over the top, but that's the only even slightly off-key note in the whole film. Bravo to all involved!"
How Do You Know,20-Dec-10,"Okay, so call me crazy, but I would NEVER give a movie a one star rating unless it was absolutely miserable. Like if I would rather leave the theater and the $10 I spent on it than watch it. How Do You Know was not a one star movie. The only problems I saw with it were that it was a little long. I thought they could have cut some scenes out and not only gotten away with it, but made it a more enjoyable experience. Also, with actors like Paul Rudd and Owen Wilson (plus how it was advertised as a comedy) I was expecting to do a lot more laughing in the movie than I really did. Don't get me wrong, it was funny, but not as much as you'd expect. I think if you go to this movie knowing it's more of a romantic comedy than a typical Owen Wilson/Paul Rudd style comedy then you'll be pleasantly surprised. I really enjoyed the movie, I thought it was very clever and surprisingly uplifting and I thought it was definitely worth the money."
How Do You Know,09-Mar-11,"I can't believe the low rating of this movie. I guess it's because it does not give you usual polished Hollywood story of romance: boy meets girl, girl has a boyfriend/fiancé who at first seems perfect but then turns out to be douche bag and/or evil and there steps in this new perfect guy, they kiss and live happily ever after, the end.Here, both guys trying to get the girl are screwed up in some way or another. Boyfriend (Owen Wilson) is not a bad guy. He is not too sensitive, he sleeps around, but the point is he doesn't try to hide it. He is honest about himself. And throughout the relationship he tries to better himself and the relationship with his girlfriend (Reese Witherspoon). On the other hand the ""new guy"" (Paul Rudd) is depressed, has no job or money and is facing prison time. And at the beginning the girl he's chasing considers him weird. His slime-ball/businessman father (Jack Nicholson) I think just adds likability to Rudds character. Also, what I like is there is no perfect ending. There is sort of a feel-good ending but it's not perfect. Although, for that you'll have to see the movie."
How Do You Know,23-Jun-17,"Everyone has times when things gets tough and they need to toughen up but life keeps moving on and we have to keep up with other stuff in life. So that's what this movie is about, in a funny way. So do watch it. Everyone has their own ideas of what a romantic comedy should be like. I am a practical, logical girl and i despise romantic comedies with too much gooey stuff. This movie was just the right amount of everything. Honestly the phrases used have so much deeper meaning, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Paul Rudd is so honest in his role, and Owen Wilson is such a cutie as always!! I really enjoyed the movie, and don't look so much into the movie, its light and funny!"
How Do You Know,20-Dec-10,"I'm kind of blown away to see that this movie did so poorly over the weekend. I saw it and enjoyed myself and I know others will too. It's not a flawless movie (but neither is Tron, and just about any other Hollywood movie out there) but it's fun and quirky with a lot of heart. Paul Rudd's performance is incredible and nomination worthy. Lesser known actor Kathryn Hahn (who apparently was actually pregnant during filming) is also a standout, and her scene with actor Lenny Venito towards the end of the film made my eyes water. There are some definite magical moments in this film that make up for it's flaws (such as the cheesy scene where Reese gives a speech to her teammates inside her apartment). It's most certainly not a 1 star movie and I hope it sticks around one more weekend so more people have a chance to see it!"
How Do You Know,28-May-11,"I am finding it hard to understand why How Do You Know has received so many poor reviews. My husband and I are both PhDs (in the arts) and loved the film. We were pleased by subtle characterization and sensitive acting that showed us, rather than dictating to us, what to think and feel;we loved Brooks's tender approach to human foibles that allowed us to care for the characters, so that it matters to you what happens to them. Both the writing AND the acting were good, and the actors were well-matched to their parts, and to each other. Especially effective was the ""conversion"" of Lisa from a suspicion regarding whether mother/wife types could possibly be satisfied, as she witnesses, with her own eyes, the magic of fidelity and bringing new life into the world. Also nice was the way that the plot and subplot were intertwined, so that the ""fabliaux"" figures and their relationship informed the fates of the major characters. Bravo, and what a pity that this generation needs something more flashy!"
How Do You Know,13-Mar-11,"To prevent claims that I am negatively reviewing this film because I don't like this type of film, I start by saying I enjoyed many of James L. Brooks' earlier works such as As Good As It Gets or Terms of Endearment. Mr. Brooks has demonstrated his ability to put together a diverse and talented cast and bring them together focusing on the things that make all of us different. The writing brings everything together where the work stands on it's own and is as strong as the sum of it's parts. So what happened here??? This film is a painful and mind numbing experience in boredom, bad writing, bad chemistry and pure stupidity! I have watched many a film and rarely have trouble sitting through them. I found myself laughing and almost screaming at this movie to go somewhere! Is it deserving of one star? Maybe I am being too harsh? No, how can you take a movie with Reese Witherspoon, Paul Rudd, Owen Wilson and Jack Nicholson and basically throw away their talent by wrapping it around insanely boring and random dialog? The first few times the characters think they are saying something witty that makes no sense to where the movie isn't going, it is irritating. To sit through two hours of this torture is enough to drive one to drink! This movie had no exposure for a reason, avoid it! I am sure you have something better to do for two hours even if it is to watch episodes of I Love Lucy you have already seen."
How Do You Know,26-Dec-10,"This was a total waste of money. With such great actors I expected much more. I was so disappointed. There was not much of a plot. There was no spark between the actors. The best part of the movie was the pregnant secretary, who, all in all, had a very minor role. Her role is the only reason I gave this move a 2 rather than a 1. I love Jack Nicholson. I have loved every movie I have ever seen him in. I did not like him in this movie. I am amazed that he agreed to take on such a weak character. Reese Witherspoon is as cute as ever and Paul Rudd is is still the wholesome boy next door but even with these three actors, the movie was a total waste of time and money."
How Do You Know,15-Mar-11,"Now I know what Alex DeLarge felt at the hands of the British Penal System and its experimental aversion therapy...The dialogues are out of key, the characters don't connect, the music is just a punch in the stomach... Any expectation built for this movie is rapidly consumed by the expectation that it ends soon... but it doesn't... Two whole hours of movie which seem more like five and will let any who tries to watch it as tired as Coach Mo after running the marathon...If you're hopping for something in the lines of ""As Good As It Get"" with smart dialogues like ""The Simpsons"" then you're in for a disappointment."
How Do You Know,03-Jan-11,"James Brooks has given us some spectacular work before. There was real magic in the writing of both ""As Good As It Gets"" and ""Terms of Endearment"", with their respective relationships ringing true and heartfelt. Each character shining individually and in their interactions. Not of it happens in this film. It is as if everyone was working alone and never talked to each other, much worse, Brooks seems to have no control over them or generating something that has any coherence. Each of the parts here is very good, with Witherspoon and Rudd doing some fine work, and Nicholson trying to salvage whatever part he has been given, but overall the results are very disappointing.What could have a sweet and intelligent story of second chances and lucky breaks turns out to be a long, verbose, and not very entertaining film, as each of the main actors struggle to keep the narrative going. The problem is not the complexity of the material but the unnecessary amount of dialog that Brooks has come up with to explain some rather simple dilemma. The best moments in the film, and there aren't many involve the limited verbal exchanges between two secondary characters when their baby is born, but watching Rudd and Witherspoon handle their strained conversation is at times painful and challenging for both them and us.The problem with the dialog is that it doesn't ring true. People struggle with relationships and initial meetings, but eventually the rhythm changes and a more natural flow occurs. Here, everyone's pattern is the same. We can't tell one person from the other, and in the end, the film suffers.One last thought: It could have been much better."
How Do You Know,15-Dec-17,"Ok, so I went into this thinking- The ratings are pretty bad, but then again how bad can a movie with Paul Rudd and Reese Witherspoon be? Oh, and Owen Wilson. 
And i was right. Granted, it was no Notting Hill, but then again most romantic comedies aren't. I would even go as far as to say that this movie has been wrongly characterized and is more of a romantic movie with a couple of chuckles.
While the plot and character development could've used just a little fixing up, I'm glad this movie was made, and I'm glad I had the chance to see it."
How Do You Know,17-Dec-10,"""How Do You Know"" is a thoughtful, funny, and romantic dramedy. It covers young people in their early thirties having to make tough choices about their life and career, and does it with way more thought and accuracy than something like ""Morning Glory""(2010).The film begins with some interesting parallels. George (Paul Rudd) and Lisa (Reese Witherspoon) have had some unlucky breaks in their careers and their lives are going straight downhill. George is with an analytically-minded girlfriend but she thinks his troubles would be too much for their relationship, meanwhile Lisa is with Matty (Owen Wilson) but he doesn't have enough brain power to care what she's thinking let alone what that would mean. It ends up playing out like a romantic comedy rather than a drama, but there is still a lot of thought and simple honesty to the whole thing.This is the role that I have been waiting for for Paul Rudd. He is still very funny but this is about his character and what he's going to do with the crap that life has handed him. Witherspoon was cute and likable. Sometimes their simple messages were too simple and things got a little too neat, but the actors were all quite funny and I thoroughly enjoyed ""How Do You Know""."
How Do You Know,05-Sep-17,"Recently I set out to collect and watch every movie that my favorite comedy actor, Owen Wilson ever stared in. I came across this film and thought I'm in for another of those romance movies for girls. I was wrong. While this movie is more romance, than comedy I had moments, where I laughed out loud. (Especially the scene where Wilson's character reads out his ""love letter"") The movie was written so that at the beginning I didn't really like Rudd's character and I cheered for Wilson's character. As the movie progressed though I started to like Rudd more and more until at the end, I was happy for him. Btw I liked Jack Nicholson in it too, I know he was a very bad father and person, but I felt sorry for him at the end."
How Do You Know,18-Dec-10,"Tonight it was a rain-soaked, bone-chilling, blustery night and I wanted to find a warm comforting place to spend some enjoyable time. So, I took myself to the local theater. Of the week's new offerings I chose this film to see, I'll admit, based almost solely on my past experiences seeing films with the principal actors we see here. As it turned out, the film warmed me far more than the stingy heat in the theater. It was a very comforting presentation to enjoy on a holiday season night.One can't say a great deal about the staging of a contemporary film. After all, it's not much of a challenge to capture the mundane surroundings we see every day. The film, then, needs something a lot more interesting injected into it to make it successful and this one succeeds marvelously. The plot concerning a down-on-his-luck businessman falling head-over-heels for a femjock who's just received the biggest disappointment in her life is just different enough to not be boring and interesting and fun enough to hold our attention. The director, James L. Brooks (who also scripted and co-produced), has an incredible track record for excellence as writer, producer, and director so it creates high expectations in a movie goer. He really delivers here with just the right nuance of sentimental warmth and comedy. Of course, he didn't do it alone, having some tremendous acting talent to lend a most competent hand.Being me, I couldn't help but first notice the very talented, captivatingly beautiful Reese Witherspoon as Lisa, the athlete. Yes, I can even buy her as an athlete, something not every actress could carry off. She most ably, and with seeming ease, injected not only an unmistakable air of beautiful professional competence but a degree of class, physical grace and presence that is riveting to watch. It's hard to take your eyes off of her while she's on screen, and she doesn't disappoint for a single moment. Whether she's wearing a baseball uniform or elegant evening wear, she's convincing as whoever she attempts. You just naturally want to like her, to root for her to succeed and find that most elusive of dreams; happiness. Of course, as completely captivating as she is, she's not on screen alone, but surrounded by a lot of other great talents.Everyone seems to like Paul Rudd; here as George. He's a likable everyman in the same sort of mold as Jimmy Stewart and his presence improves whatever he touches. He creates a character here that just makes you want to like him and hope he succeeds. Here, he's the down-on-his-luck businessman who is set up for a blind date with the effervescent Ms. Witherspoon. I love them as a couple. On screen, they're what a lot of people hope to be; good people who find a way through life with someone else. Of course, as films always do, there are stumbling blocks.The first stumble is that Ms. Reese is first hooked up with a real character played by the wonderfully talented Owen Wilson as Matty, the professional baseball player. He is a happy and likable guy with a simple mind and simpler morals who just can't grasp how to treat a lady - or that he really has an incredible lady right there in front of him to lose. Fun ensues and these three, Witherspoon, Rudd and Wilson really do have fun on screen and carry us along for the ride. (NOTE: One can't help but notice the quite accurate depiction of the immense difference in the way the world treats highly successful athletes of both genders. While the males are showered with obscene amounts of cash and attention, the equally great, or even perhaps better, female athletes have to settle for little more than faint praise and a pat on the back.) I was also highly entertained by a wonderful supporting cast, led by none other than the legendary Jack Nicholson as Charlie, Rudd's father and playing as fine a slime-ball as ever graced the silver screen. Thank you, Jack, for giving me a villain worthy of disliking.Now, add to this already fine mix the talent of Kathryn Hahn as Annie, Rudd's very pregnant assistant. She adds a real element of class to what otherwise may have been a mundane role. She really hits her stride in a scene with the great character actor Lenny Venito, as Al, her baby's co-producer. This pair have one of those screen moments that is so terrific it comes very close to overshadowing the main plot.Other memorable performances came from Molly Price as Coach Sally (even though her part was small she shone) and a humorous John Tormey as the doorman and, last-but-not-least the always great Tony Shalhoub as a psychiatrist Ms. Reese almost visits. The short exchange between them is very fun to watch.All-in-all it's a great film to take someone you love to during this holiday season.By Bruce L. Jones http://webpages.charter.net/bruce.jones1/"
How Do You Know,18-Dec-10,"This movie is incredibly boring. With a strong cast, all underused and nothing is remotely funny. I was on the verge of falling asleep during most part of the movie. The dialog is not engaging, nothing is.It's quite sad to see all those good actors having nothing to do on screen. The chemistry between the actors was not believable, Jack had nothing much to do. I've seen Resse in much better movies, she is not a Legally Blonde here.I wonder if it's even a love story, or even romantic, because it does not look like that. It's constant wining, not happiness, nothing.Don't go... A waste of money."
The Princess Bride,10-May-04,"I have been waiting for the right time to review this film. I did not feel until today that I was truly ready to say all I had to say about director Rob Reiner's unforgettable staple of 1980s pop culture. When I first saw The Princess Bride, I was only 7 years old, and hardly cognizant of film as anything but a pastime. While I remember the movie as being enjoyable, I did not have anywhere near as strong a liking or appreciation for it as I do now. I certainly did not remember the film as a theater-going experience, and recently, I got the chance to view it, on the big screen, with at least fifty others in attendance at a midnight screening.Personally, I am one of those people who, by nature, absorbs memorable quotes, and by that token, the entirety of The Princess Bride is fair game. As I sat there watching, I could always hear somebody, if not more than one person, at least whispering along with the movie under his or her breath. Meanwhile, I noticed that there was a wide disparity of age groups. There were pre-teens, teens, people in their twenties, thirties, and some that looked well past forty. If the showing had not been at midnight, I do not doubt that there would have been pre-pre-teens as well.With a screenplay written by William Goldman (based on his book), The Princess Bride is a classic, familiar story of a princess, her true love, and the forces that come between them. As is evidenced by those in attendance, this is a story for all ages. The manner in which this fairytale part of the story is executed by Goldman and Reiner is memorable enough to make this a great film. As any fan of the movie will tell you, however, it is the film's whimsical, irreverent, pervasive tongue-in-cheek antics that make it an unqualified masterpiece.If you hang around people who love this film, do not be surprised if they react to unbelievable situations with the exclamation, ""Inconceivable!"" Likewise, if you tell them to just wait a minute, don't be thrown aback when they suddenly sport a Spanish accent in saying, ""I hate waiting."" And if you suddenly, from out of nowhere, hear, ""Hello.my name is Inigo Montoya.you killed my father.prepare to die,"" don't worry. It's not your fault, and you're not going to die.While The Princess Bride has the sort of satirical edge more geared towards adults, the film is equally effective as a pure fairytale, and for this reason, there is a little something for everyone. In addition, the film enacts a self-referential tribute to the power and beauty of fairytale stories, even in the current age in which many consider them archaic and obsolete.A sick grandson (Fred Savage), who is spending his time mindlessly playing video games (of the nostalgic Atari 8-bit type), gets a visit from his grandfather (portrayed through a wonderful performance from Peter Falk). To the grandson's dismay, his elder has brought a book to read to him. When he expresses disapproval at his grandfather's old-fashioned ways, the grandfather's response is, ""When I was your age, television was called books."" Even this quote stands out as resonant and memorable.The grandson starts out expressing skepticism and boredom, but of course, as the reading of the story progresses, this gradually gives way to captivation and praise. Buttercup (Robin Wright, in her breakthrough role) is a fair-haired, stunningly gorgeous maiden who has been engaged to the smug, cowardly Humperdinck (Chris Sarandon), the prince who rules over the land of Florin. She of course does not love him, and she has been without joy since her true love, a farm boy named Wesley (Cary Elwes), was reportedly murdered on the seas.Of course, without Wesley, there is no story of true love, and we know that he must miraculously return to her someday. This happens through an extraordinary, and increasingly hilarious, set of circumstances. A group of three bandits kidnap Buttercup with the intent of killing her to precipitate a war between Florin and its enemy, Guilder. These three are (in order of increasing stature) the intellectually pompous Vizzini (Wallace Shawn), the Spanish swordsman Inigo (Mandy Patinkin), and the big-hearted slow-witted giant Fezzik (the late Andre the Giant, in one of the most no-brainer casting decisions in all of film history).During the kidnapping, however, a mysterious man in black closes in on the trail of the three abductors, and it is this man who takes on each of the three one by one in battles of skill, strength, smarts, and of course, deliciously witty repartee. There is something unusually extraordinary about these battles, however.With the exception of Vezzini, the abductors are not villains as we might initially perceive them to be. The marvelously choreographed swordplay between the man in black and Inigo, and the hilarious absurdity of the handfight with Fezzik, are not at all about winning or losing. They embody a sense of honor, sportsmanship, and nobility that is rarely exemplified in competition (both fictional and real).Inigo, Fezzik, and the man in black do not display their skills pretentiously or flauntingly. Instead, they take a strong sense of inner pride in the subtle mastery of their arts. As a result, when we see them engage in competition, there is not a sense of enmity, but a wonderful air of camaraderie.Also included in the mix are a sadistic count (Christopher Guest) with an odd physical characteristic and a penchant for pain, an albino (Mel Smith) with a stuffy throat, the deadly wrath of an R.O.U.S., and a clergyman (Peter Cook) who makes Elmer Fudd seem eloquently spoken. Most memorable, perhaps, is the appearance of Billy Crystal and Carol Kane as the miracle-man Max and his wife. It has been reported that in the middle of filming this scene, Reiner was forced to leave the set, because Crystal's improvisations were causing him to laugh to the point of being sick.Regarding the film's casting, every single choice, without exception, is absolute perfection. Cary Elwes not only easily looks the part of a daring, ingenious hero, but as an actor, he has an incredible gift for a subtle mixture of drama and comedy, one that easily coincides with the film's sensibilities. Robin Wright easily essays the role of the headstrong princess, endlessly devoted to her love (with a convincing British accent, despite her American origins).For the scene of swordplay, Elwes and Patinkin had to study fencing for months, which is impressive, but on-screen, I had no trouble believing that they were characters who had studied for at least several years. Despite his limited acting ability, wrestler Andre the Giant is perfect for the role of Fezzik, and something would be lost with any other actor in his place. And of course, Wallace Shawn is endlessly amusing to watch as the diminutive, perpetually exasperated Vezzini.We also don't have to hear Christopher Guest and Chris Sarandon speak any lines to know they are portraying villains. The arrogance, callousness, and sliminess are readily apparent in their facial and bodily expressions.When all is said and done, we have witnessed a wide variety of hilarity, captivating acts of love and heroism, and of course, one of the most satisfying acts of retribution ever put on film (one that immortalizes the film's most famous quote and chooses just the right time and placement for the film's sole swear word).For someone who watches this film for the first time, and quickly catches on to the film's capricious mix of reverence and satire, the film is a marvel to watch simply for the knowledge that you do not know what will come next. Will there be a touching moment? A reflective one? An act of bravado? Or will our expectations be subverted in an act of comical subterfuge? The answer: any of them will do, as the film has a delectable variety of all of them.From start to finish, The Princess Bride is a transcendent, magical experience that constantly elicits uproarious laughter and simultaneously immerses the audience in a rich, magnificent, and almost nostalgic world of folklore that, after the end credits roll, seems timeless and undying. In the years since its release in 1987, it has grown into a cult film of legendary status, and judging by the wide variety of ages I witnessed at the screening (as well as the endless barrage of quoting), it seems perfectly reasonable to assume that the film will endure for many years to come."
The Princess Bride,08-Dec-99,"This is one of those rare films that gets better each time you watch it. With something for everyone, The Princess Bride combines romance, action, adventure and parody to create the perfect movie.Cary Elwes and Robin Wright are beautiful to watch and the story of their love is a wonderful backdrop to the adventure and intrigue played out in this story. Mandy Patinkin is wonderful as Inigo and gets to deliver some of the best lines in the film. Chris Sarandon is perfect in his role as the bad guy prince.The plot is rich, with adult innuendos the kids will miss all together and levels of wit to entertain the whole family. The dialogue is full of very funny catch phrases-  many of which are still part of my repertoire more than a decade after I first saw the movie.   If you like dry humor and fast wit, The Princess Bride will make your day.I have owned this video since 1988 and still watch it regularly - it has become my 'sick day' movie because it is such a joy."
The Princess Bride,10-Jan-01,"There's enough reviews here to show how enjoyable and entertaining this movie is, but I had to put my own word in...I simply love this movie. I watched it with my parents when I was very young, and have been watching it constantly ever since. It's a movie that I just can't seem to grow tired of. For one, I absolutely love the medieval fantasy genre, both in books and movies. From a small child I've loved knights, castles, dragons. the whole sort. This movie, quite simply, puts the viewer into an imaginative world where everything seems real. Second, the characters are so enjoyable to watch, you really begin to feel for them - all of them. Even humperdink, whose name does him justice, gets pity at the end. Lastly, the grandfather's list of the qualities of the book at the very beginning are all true... this story has everything. That is why it is such a classic, when everything comes down to it. From the moving love story between Wesly and Buttercup, to the dynamic and brilliantly scripted duel between the Man in Black and Indigo, to even the hilarious bickering from Vezinni to his lovable giant, Fezzik... This movie finds a place to include EVERYTHING one can imagine.  The story moves along at a great pace, and you feel as though the whole land has been covered when the book is closed. Furthermore, the whole conception of using the ""telling a story"" approach doesn't taken away from the realism of the story, but raises it even more by showing how mesmerized the boy is, listening to the tale - just as we are, in front of the screen.Maybe it was how I was captivated to the screen, watching it as a child... Maybe it was how I'd pop the movie in and turn a boring Sunday afternoon an exciting adventure as I grew up... Or maybe it's how I can sit down with friends and all enjoy the movie together, laughing at its funny parts, and cheering at it's exciting moments. The movie has a place in my heart, and that will never go away. A ""10"" on the scale, and even these words, can't begin to tell how much I love this movie."
The Princess Bride,06-Aug-02,"I'm not exactly sure what exactly it is that makes The Princess Bride such a spectacular film. Or, at the very least, I just can't pinpoint a single characteristic about it that really rises above all others as the main reason that no one should miss it. Indeed, it has a title that should prove to be remarkably uninteresting to the typical action adventure fan (okay, MALE action adventure fan), but even the most die-hard Die Hard fan would love this film. It is extremely important not to judge this film just because it has such a flowery and dangerously (at the risk of sounding shallow) girly name, because it is full of wonderful adventure and even some good killing and violence. Does this belong in this kind of romantic comedy? Absolutely! The cover box of the film looks like that of a cheesy romance novel, but the film is truly great from start to finish. And, indeed, the film is very aware of the superficial impression that it leaves, and it even presents it directly through Fred Savage's initial response to his grandfather reading him the story. But as the film goes on, we begin to have the same reaction that Fred has. We can't get enough. 
Cary Elwes delivers by far the most outstanding performance of his career as Westley, the love-struck servant to Buttercup, a beautiful blonde woman living in a misty romantic fantasy world. Sadly, Elwes' later career has been punctuated by roles that do not serve him well, especially after such a stunning performance in this role. Liar Liar and Twister come immediately to mind. Robin Wright also gives one of the best performances of her career in her film debut here as Princess Buttercup, but the real quality of the performances that makes the movie so great is the fact that they were able to pack the film full of comic relief (it was nearly nonstop from start to finish) without taking anything away from the tension or the overall respectability of the film. It is interesting to consider the polar opposite effect of the comic relief on the vast majority of the James Bond films. Wallace Shawn is absolutely hilarious as Vizzini, the bonehead villain who is completely convinced that he has the whole world figured out, Andre the Giant delivers a lumbering but highly impressive performance as Vizzini's enormous, idiot sidekick, and by far my favorite of all, Mandy Patinkin creates one of the most entertaining and likeable characters created in a film in the entire decade of the 1980s (`My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die!').  This is great stuff. Told as a story read from a book, just like The Neverending Story, The Princess Bride provides a magical mix of romance and fantasy and action and comedy to provide an enormously entertaining film for moviegoers of all ages. The Princess Bride is an absolutely wonderful film that is truly not to be missed."
The Princess Bride,02-Mar-04,"""As you wish..."" ""Inconceivable!"" ""My name is Inigo Montoya...""
I love this film so much.From its opening scenes of the young boy being read a story by his kindly Grandfather to the romance, action, adventure and fun of the fairy tale. The Princess bride tells the tale of the beautiful Buttercup (Robin Wright) and her true love Westley (Elwes)who become separated through the course of an unfortunate event involving some pirates. Westley's destiny is to rescue Buttercup from the clutches of an evil Prince so that they might be together again. Yet he's not bargained on some of the wonderful characters that he will meet (and befriend) along the way...This film is so deliciously acted, made and written that it is a treat to watch.I've lost count of how many times I've seen it now. But every time I still gain the same enormous amount of pleasure from watching it. A movie that is a delight for the young and just as much fun for everyone else.
The actors are all superb in their roles ('perfect casting' does not come close to describing it!) A young Cary Elwes is suitably dashing as our cocky hero (check out the sword fighting!)and Robin Wright is good as the beautiful Buttercup. Mandy Patinkin is great as the vengeful Inigo Montoya who utters that famous ""you killed my father. prepare to die"" line. Everyone else gives there all, including Christoper Guest, Chris Sarandon (as the main villian), Wallace Shawn, the late Andre The Giant,Mel Smith, and Billy Crystal.Even though it is about 18 years old, the humour and sly jokes are still as sharp today as they were back in 1987.You know you are watching a great movie when you here Elwes' ""To the pain..."" speech near the end. You've probably seen The Princess Bride. If so...go and watch it again. Right now, and remind yourself how good it is! And if you haven't- what are you waiting for? Go and check it out now! It's worth it! Hands up who can quote this entire film off by heart! ;)Watch out for:The R.O.U.S's Elwes' and Patinkin's Sword/word fight The Miracle Max scene When our heroes storm the castle (Go Inigo! Go Inigo!) Elwes' ""To the pain..."" speech. (Superb. Shows what a great (and unfortunately underused) actor he is)"
The Princess Bride,28-Sep-03,"This film is an intelligent, sardonic send up of several genres that pokes fun (affectionately) at fairy tales, swashbucklers, love stories and basic conventions of film.  One of my favorite scenes is where Inigo Montoya first confronts his quarry after years of searching.  His adversary does the unexpected-and what most villains in real life WOULD do under the same circumstances, with hilarious results in the scene.  Basil Rathbone probably whirled in his grave!Not by any means Citizen Kane (we already have one of those, anyway) but a champ in its weight class, with a perfect score, a fine script and good performances.  Far more true to the flavor of the original fairy tales that it spoofs than even the best of Disney's takes.  I loved it the first time I saw it and love it more now.  Well worth watching.  Recommended."
The Princess Bride,17-Oct-98,"The simplest pleasures in life are the best, and this film is one of them. Combining a rather basic storyline of love and adventure this movie transcends the usual weekend fair with wit and unmitigated charm.  Every character is a delight and you just want to see more of them.  ""The Princess Bride"" is based on the unsurpassed novel by William Goldman, who also penned the screenplay. While this is a movie review, I cannot recommend the book on which it is based more highly.  It is quite simply the most humorous, enthralling fable ever written and will fill in many details that were impossible to include on the screen.  The only other movie of this type that I can think of that is this much fun was Danny Kaye's ""The Court Jester,"" another costumed comedy/adventure/romance that I also highly recommend."
The Princess Bride,12-Mar-01,"The Princess Bride is a wonderful family film about a maiden named Buttercup and her ""farmboy"" Wesley. When Wesley goes away to seek his fortune, he is reported to be killed by the Dread Pirate Roberts. Hearing this really gets Buttercup down, and it only gets worse when Prince Humperdink chooses her to be his bride.( Hence the title) To make a long story short and not give away the ending, Buttercup's kidnapped for suspicious reasons and rescued by someone familiar. She's in love and nothing can stop true love! A couple of deaths, a would be wedding, revenge fulfilled, and a couple reunited end this gala of a film. But this doesn't even sum it up, I promise! I love this film because it does not take itself too seriously and flows well across the screen. The main characters and their supporting cast are quirky and memorable. You will be repeating classic lines like, ""My name is Inigo Montoya, you killed my father, prepare to die!"" over and over again. Through the adventures of Wesley and Buttercup you feel drawn to the characters and fall in love with their ability to amuse you. Do you want to be entertained with a light hearted fantasy/comedy? Then head on over to your local video store and pick up a copy. Ready to enjoy? ""As you wish."""
The Princess Bride,19-Apr-04,"Cary Elwes, Mandy Patinkin, and Robin Wright Penn star in this classic fairy tale entitled The Princess Bride. It is based on a novel by William Goldman, who also wrote the screenplay. Director Rob Reiner brings life to this story and effectively evokes the enchanting spirit of the witty 1973 novel.The movie opens with a sick boy (Fred Savage) who receives a visit from his grandfather (Peter Falk) who intends to read to him from his favorite book. The boy is not exactly pleased to be distracted from his world of video games. However, his mood quickly changes as he and the viewer are transported to a place out of time. We are taken to Florin, a kingdom in an imaginary land, complete with dashing heroes, cowardly princes, rhyming giants, rodents of unusual size, fancy swordfights, and yes . . . even some kissing.
This fairy tale begins on a farm in the countryside. There lives a beautiful, young woman named Buttercup (Robin Wright Penn) who learns that ""as you wish"" really means ""I love you"" when she falls for her farmhand Westley (Cary Elwes). While trying to seek his fortune, Westley disappears at sea and becomes an apparent victim of the Dread Pirate Roberts. A few years later, Buttercup, who is now engaged to Prince Humperdinck (Chris Sarandon), is kidnapped by a trio of misfits, which includes brains--Vizzini (Wallace Shawn); brawn--Fezzik (André the Giant); and sword--Inigo Montoya (Mandy Patinkin). As they sail away toward the Cliffs of Insanity, they notice the pursuit of a man in black. Now begins the adventure . . . .
The central idea of The Princess Bride is that true love can conquer all. Throughout the movie, there are many hardships and trials that true love must endure. The movie keeps the viewer guessing until the very end whether or not there will be the classic fairy tale ending.
This movie is appealing to me because of the classic fairy tale style combined with the witty humor, well choreographed action sequences, and intense instances of suspense. The characters are well developed and all the actors give an amazing performance which adds to the overall appeal of the movie. The Princess Bride is easily one of my all time favorite movies."
The Princess Bride,19-Jan-20,"To call The Princess Bride a classic is to understate it's significance. The Princess Bride is not only a great movie, it is above all else, a GOOD movie. It unites us as a culture and reveals within our collective nature a longing for the simple times when heroes were righteous and pure, villains were dastardly and vile, redemption was always possible for the wayward soul, and true love could overcome any obstacle. I pray we can find those days again."
The Princess Bride,03-Jul-03,"I love this movie!  It's sweet, but with satirical humor. The dialogue is great and the adventure scenes are fun.  Rob Reiner shows an excellent touch once again with comedy and a childlike point of view.  It manages to be whimsical romantic while laughing at the conventions of the fairy tale genre. I would recommend it to just about anyone. I've seen it several times, and I'm always happy to see it again whenever I have a friend who hasn't seen it yet. I haven't watched it with any kids, but I think it has lots for them too. There are wonderful quotes throughout.  I think Mandy Patinkin absolutely steals the scenes he is in as the Spaniard Inigo Montoya, bent on avenging his father's death. I gave it 8 out of 10 mainly because it feels very light, but I may go back and change to 9 thinking of how happy this movie makes me and it's rewatchability."
The Princess Bride,18-Nov-03,"The Princess Bride is one of those rare, but very perfect films that everyone once in their life time has seen. Just because it is such a loved film, how could you not love it? It has action, romance, revenge, sword fights, true love, humor, friendship, etc. I was only 2 when this film was released, but I still remember how much I was in love with this film at 4. I would rewind the tape and watch it over and over again, the funny thing was my parents wouldn't mind watching it with me, it appeals to children as well as adults. I think the reason why this was such a fantastic film was due to the fact that it was the perfect mixture of a fairy tale with humor, action, and romance. Rob Reiner really knew what he was doing when he made this movie; and it all starts with a grandfather simply reading his favorite childhood story to his sick grandson.Buttercup and Wesley are two farm people who eventually fall deeply in love, but in order to get money to get married, Wesley goes off to find a job and start a life for them. But when Buttercup hears of Wesley's death by pirates, she is taken away by Prince Humperdinck who is about to make her his bride. She is then kidnapped by three rebels who wish to start a war with the prince, Vizzini, Fezzik, and Indigo Montoya(who is on a revenge streak to kill the six fingered man who killed his father). But she is saved by an unknown pirate who later reveals himself as Wesley who escaped death, but Buttercup is taken once again right as she and Wesley are reunited by Prince Humperdinck. The prince orders to torture Wesley and kill him to keep him away from Buttercup, but Wesley ends up being saved by Fezzik and Indigo who will help him save Buttercup.The Princess Bride is a classic film that will never be forgotten. It has classic lines like: Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya, you killed my father prepare to die. And of course INCONCEIVABLE repeated constantly by Vizzini. The acting is perfect and the sets are just amazing. Of course who could forget Billy Cristal and Carol Cane's great performance of the miracle worker and his wife? They were just priceless. Please watch this movie, it's one of those movies that's just impossible not to like, why not to like it would be inconceivable.10/10"
The Princess Bride,31-Dec-19,Can't exactly say what makes this movie great but it is definitely one of a kind. And of course the iconic Inigo Montoya line is worth watching for.
The Princess Bride,02-Jan-08,"A fast paced love story that has everything in it... ""Fencing, fighting, torture, revenge, giants, monsters, chases, escapes, true love, miracles..."" everything you could ever hope for. It has those corny 80's special effects you just have to love. Brilliantly choreographed fight scenes, Andre the Giant playing a not so bright giant, who is very good at rhyming. There's a lost pirate, an evil prince, a not so willingly princess, and an adorably senile king. Not to mention, the Spaniard with a vendetta, the miracle max with a grudge, and the priest with a speech impediment. As well as a well meaning grandpa, and a young boy who learns an important life lesson. And for the girls it has this... ""Since the invention of the kiss there have been five kisses that were rated the most passionate, the most pure. This one left them all behind. The End."" ... o and of course it teaches us what to the pain means. Now ill leave you with these simple words AS YOU WISH"
The Princess Bride,24-Oct-14,"I very rarely like to put 10/10 for a rating of something as I feel nothing is perfect. However, this movie i feel is so close to that 10/10 it would be wrong not to award it this. Although it may not be the greatest movie ever made, it is brilliant in its own right. The characters are humorous, the dialogue is witty and the cast is brilliant. It contains so many different elements which also make it a really good family film. Action, adventure, sword-fighting, pirates, romance, comedy and fantasy. It captures all the elements I could Whilst I still stand by the fact that the book is better, this is still my favourite film."
The Princess Bride,01-Jan-17,"I didn't have this theory about ""The Princess Bride"" for years, until I came close to the age of the grandfather that Peter Falk portrays.Here's my theory. The grandfather goes to the bedside of his grandson, portrayed by Fred Savage, prepared to do what grandfathers do - read him a story. But no, the grandson protests. Does it have sports in it? This is a silly ""yucky"" story full of kissing. Skip the kissing parts! So the grandfather decides to teach the grandson a lesson (the beginning of my theory). He takes what was probably a straightforward tale of love lost and found again, of giants and evil princes and rescues and magic spells, and embellishes it with the wisdom that can only come from living sixty years on this planet. Because, let's face it, The Princess Bride as we are told has much wisdom in it.What are the chances that a story that has been around for a hundred years has lines such as ""You fell victim to one of the classic blunders - the most famous of which is ""never get involved in a land war in Asia"". Only somebody who lived through the Vietnam War era (the grandfather) would come up with this. Too bad Dubya wasn't read this book as a child. Then there is the bit about the Dread Pirate Roberts - an unseen villain who turns out to be a series of villains. He would tuck Wesley into bed each night after he captured him and say ""Good night, Westley. Good work. Sleep well. I'll most likely kill you in the morning."" What other sentence so captures the sentiment of working for large corporations these days who will throw you out into the street without a backwards glance? The book hits how people believe something is real or not real based merely on their feelings about it with this zinger as Wesley carries the princess through a dangerous swamp. She cautions him about the ROUS's (Rodents of Unusual Size). Wesley's defense - ""I don't think they exist"". One immediately attacks.And finally a great quote about love. An angry Prince Humperdinck after being rejected by Buttercup goes to where Wesley is about to be tortured and states ""You truly love each other, and so you might have been truly happy. Not one couple in a century has that chance, no matter what the storybooks say."" Only after kissing frogs for decades can I say this is so true. And on it goes.Thus most of the wisdom of living modern life can be found in this tale within a tale, and I highly recommend it for its humor, its wisdom, and uniqueness. I don't think I've seen anything quite like it."
The Princess Bride,18-Jan-20,"This movie is still one of my all time favorites, after all these years! Just a couple days ago, my 28 year old daughter and I were watching, and talking about Andre the Giant. Still watching, still talking, and still learning about the great stuff this movie has brought."
The Princess Bride,17-Jul-18,"The Princess Bride has been a film that I've always wanted to watch but never got the opportunity until now (Thank you Goodwill!). After finishing the film, I can see why it's close to so many people's hearts. Throughout the film, I caught myself smiling at moments and bursting with laughter at others. It is a very easy watch. The story's pace is great, making the viewer captivated and invested in the characters throughout the entire film. This is done with the help of some fantastically choreographed sword fighting, hilarious jokes, and an array of diverse characters.Even though I enjoyed this film, there are some things I can nitpick. I noticed many continuity errors while watching the film; not that it really matters, but it was sometimes distracting me from the story. I also felt as though there were times where the plot was too convenient or over the top. This could have been intentional since most child bedtime stories are outlandish, but there were scenes such as when they break into the castle that had me scratching my head and saying what the??? There were also parts of the film where I felt as though characters knew things or had things that they probably wouldn't, like when Fizzik pulls out a random black robe from his sleeve. That was confusing, but again, I might just be missing the humor behind those parts.Even though I had some tiny issues with the film, I still had fun with this movie. There were many moments that reminded me of when my dad used to read stories of knights and pirates to me as I fell asleep. This childhood sentimentality mixed with the feelings of whimsy and familiarity while watching the film is why I think that this film was such a fun experience. I would definitely recommend this film, it might not be everyone's cup of tea, but I think most will find something fun about this story of silliness, revenge, and true love.The Good

The Princess Bride,25-Mar-99,"One of those great treasures that you cannot dislike. No matter how many times you see, it takes you breath away, makes you laugh and gives you a taste of the old swashbuckler films of the 1930's. Rob Reiner directs this wonderful romance-comedy-adventure with passion and wit. A classic in a class of its own."
The Princess Bride,13-Aug-19,An hilarious movie that knows exactly what it is. The actors takes their roles seriously and delivers perfectly. It's nice to see young rising stars in an early role which is the case for Robin Wright and most certainly for Cary Elwes.I had a good feeling and a big smile on my lips throughout the movie. Well worth a watch more than 30 years after release.
The Princess Bride,28-May-18,"Maybe a spoiler at the end....maybe. It is 2018 and this movie is now 31 years old. I am pushing 70 and have watched several thousand movies. For clean family-viewable entertainment, this has to be in almost everyone's all time top ten. Or five. Mandy Patinkin, a very fine actor, was never better than as Inigo Montoya, the Spanish swordsman. Robin Wright, barely 21, was exquisite as Buttercup. Cary Elwes has never, IMO, been quite as good as he was as Westley...but then, he was superlative as Westley, setting the bar very, very high. All of the acting ranges from good to great. The inclusion of Andre as Fezzik was random ""geniusness""....it just worked, and worked oh so incredibly well. I have watched this movie many times and I still love it. The outer wrap of grandfather Peter Falk reading the story to his grandson Fred Savage takes the ""Family Friendliness"" rating to a fifty on a 1-10 scale. There are many, many characters to enjoy in this fanciful tale; my personal favorite has always been Inigo Montoya. The sword fight scene remains, for me, one of the finest pieces of dramatic comedy I've ever seen, no matter who was the victor."
The Princess Bride,08-May-20,"Confession. I don't usually like fantasy films. I didn't mind them as a kid and I think I quite liked this, but it didn't leave a lasting impression. I'd put it in the same category as Labyrinth. To be fair, they're both films that have garnered cult status. I've not watched Labyrinth in 30 years (nor do I feel the need to), but I'm guessing that this has aged better. I'd forgetten all about the story-telling narration aspect, Peter Falk reading 'The Princess Bride' to Fred Savage in his all- American bedroom, what a bizarre premise that seems, but it's ridiculously charming and effective. The opening scenes are pure schmaltzy over blown medieval romance and would be pretty unbearable without Fred's voice over, rolling its eyes. It's silly, but never really farcical, deftly balancing it's comedic wit with what feels like a genuine love for its characters. Ah the characters, if you're not smiling within 10 minutes, check your pulse, they're all wonderful! I'm hooked... and so is Fred. Let's not beat around the bush. It takes me no time at all to fall in love, it's 100 times better than I recall. Do you like perfectly choreographed swashbuckling sword fights? This has you covered, with added academic commentary from the combatants. Too flashy? How about ""You put down your rock, I'll put down my sword, we'll try kill each other like civilised people"". I'd also forgotten how quotable this is. ""Life is pain (heiress), anyone who says differently is selling something"" and of course ""Hello my name is Inigo Montoya, prepare to die."" The dialogue really is bloody flawless, littered with fun quips and even the haughty grandising from Prince Humperdink is fun. He is the weak link here though if there is one. Cary Elwes is absolutely marvellous, his lovely exposition explaining his becoming the Dread Pirate Roberts whilst dodging death in the fire swamp is so simple and effective, it's quite disarming and if you didn't already root for our hero, you do now. Then bang, bloody quicksand! (aka Lightning Sand) and 'Rodents of Unusual Size' cementing it's 80s calibre. If someone made this now (please say the rumours aren't true) they'd ruin it with CGI. You really can't beat a bloke in a giant rat suit. You also can't beat Mel Smith in dodgy make-up or Billy Crystal layered in tons of it. It's around this time too that I realise that Prince Humperdink's right hand man is no other than Nigel ""This one goes to up to 11"" Tufnel!! and he's still obsessed with numbers as he cranks up The Machine in The Pit of Dispair. It's all quite simple, the lower class good guys verses the villainous royalty, both chasing the prize that is Princess Buttercup. As we get toward the finale, the threatened wedding of Humperdink & Buttercup, I nearly fall off my chair as Peter Cook announces ""Mawwage is what bwings us together today"". It limps a little as the final minutes draw in, but Andre the Giant keeps the tone light as Buttercup is inevitably rescued, Inigo avenges his father and the as the fairytale ends, I'm left with a warm smile. To think I wasn't sure I'd enjoy this, ""Inconceivable!"""
The Princess Bride,15-Mar-20,Incredible film that continues to prove its worth with every subsequent watch. A classic to defy the ages!
The Princess Bride,12-Dec-19,"As a kid I took the movie very seriously. I loved it, but I didn't get all of the humor. Instead, I loved the sword fights and the attack of the ROUS. I took the story at face value, and it was great. It inspired me to read fantasy literature and to learn fencing. It made me love adventure and question whether or not a pirate and thief could be honorable. It was a great movie at this level.As I got older I began to appreciate the comedy. I laughed at Miracle Max. I laughed at the wedding scene. I laughed at the Sicilian and Fezzik's rhyming. I began to appreciate how the fencing was not just well done, but given a humorous tone. It works even better like this, and was like an entirely new movie.Even in the last few years, I have gained a new appreciation for the movie. I have noticed the different archetypes, and I understand that the movie and the book are of great literary value as well. The story takes some fairly simple characters and situations, like the honorable thief and the battle of wits, and creates an interesting and wonderful story. Each time I watch it I begin thinking about all of the different allusions that appear.All in all, this is a wonderful film. I have watched it over and over again, and I will watch it with my high school students every year."
The Princess Bride,20-Sep-14,"A romance, a comedy, an adventure & a fantasy, The Princess Bride is an amalgamation of all of these and is a fairy tale that has been passed from fathers to sons for generations and here is presented in the form of a novel that is being read by a grandfather to his grandson, thus making sure that the book's narrative style & structure is kept entirely preserved.The Princess Bride tells the story of Buttercup who falls in love with a farm guy but loses him and is at last engaged to the Prince of the region. One day, she is kidnapped & held against her will by three hired helpers; a Sicilian boss, a Spanish swordsman & a giant. But they soon find themselves being pursued by a mysterious masked man who's gaining on their trail.Rob Reiner has directed some well-known classics (A Few Good Men, Stand by Me & When Harry Met Sally...) but most people are still not familiar with his name because unlike other filmmakers, he has no unique style of shooting a film or possesses a trademark. And this is another one of his films that's pretty different in style & approach when compared to his other works. And Reiner does a good job at it.The screenplay is adapted from the book of the same name in a manner that preserves its narrative style, camera-work & editing nicely compliment each other, visuals effects never aims for a realistic portrayal of the world depicted in the story plus it benefits very much from its sweet, tender & pleasant performances from its cast, including Andre the Giant.On an overall scale, there isn't much wrong with The Princess Bride & carries out most of its elements the way it's meant to be. More entertaining than what I was expecting from it, definitely showing a lot of heart, warmth & charm and yet it didn't click enough with me for I'm not really a fan of fairy tales. But for those who've read the book or heard the story or even many newcomers, this will be a delightful experience."
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,02-May-02,"Simply incredible. Never before have I seen a 3 hour movie that didn't seem like 3 hours. I read the Lord of the Rings very recently and I was surprised at how similar Peter Jackson's vision was to my own.Now about the omissions and alterations. I'm not a crazed fanatic who gets worked up over every little detail. I didn't mind Arwen's inflation and I'm actually glad Tom Bombadil was scrubbed (I felt Tom Bombadil was an unnecessary addition to the book). Despite these minor changes, the screenplay stays extremely close to the book and flows very very well (and the prologue was a nice touch).The acting was flawless. As I've read many many times in other reviews, McKellen doesn't play Gandalf, he IS Gandalf. Wood, Mortensen, Holm, Astin, everyone was fantastic. My hat's off to Sean Bean who delivers an excellent performance as Boromir, a character who's intentions are good but wrestles with the corrupting power of the Ring. Bean portrays it VERY well. Oh, and Andy Serkis does a PERFECT Gollum voice. It's EXACTLY as I imagined it myself.The special effects were incredible, the cave troll, the balrog, Gollum, and Sauron's Eye all looked amazing. I was also very impressed by the seamless shrinking of the vertically challenged characters.What's wrong with this movie? I have no idea... I thought everything was perfect. MY biggest gripe is having to wait an entire year to see The Two Towers!"
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,11-Dec-01,"Breathtaking.  Unique.  Captivating.  Enchanting.Within minutes of the start of this first chapter of an undeniably epic trilogy, the audience was left gasping at the intensity of the images on the screen.  And we had nearly three hours to go.The scope of Tolkien's masterpiece may have eluded film-makers for decades, but director Peter Jackson makes good on his promise: he has not only brought us the tale of Frodo and his bold companions, he has brought us Middle Earth.  And believe me, it is BIG.  Sweeping vistas and hang-onto-your-seat camera shots send us zooming through the towering cities and citadels of Tolkien's imagination.But even more impressive than the stunning visuals and sound-effects-like-you've-never-heard-before are the actors who breathe life into the characters.  Ian McKellen's portrayal of Gandalf is nothing short of awe-inspiring, and Elijah Wood's Frodo is one of the most unexpectedly captivating performances I've seen in a long time.  The despair, terror, and determination of the Fellowship is all there, in spades.  I left the theater aching...from tensing every muscle during the fight and flight sequences--the breathless and compelling kind we haven't seen since Spielberg gave us a desperate charge onto the D-Day beaches of Normandy.Those unfamiliar with Tolkien's world may quickly find themselves lost in it, but happily so.  The depth of his creation cannot be grasped in a few hours, and it doesn't need to be; the struggle of good against evil explodes on the screen, and leaves little room for complaint.The movie ended with a stunned audience sitting on the edges of their seats, feeling somewhat bereft.  We were exhausted, but no one wanted to wait a year for more.Jackson's ambitious first chapter is truly unlike anything you've seen this year.  George Lucas and Chris Columbus take note: this is how you deliver on a cinematic promise.For everyone else: don't you dare miss it."
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,08-Oct-02,"It is with no surprise that Peter Jackson's The Fellowship of the Ring film has received such mixed critics. Many viewers refer to it as being childish, boring and uninteresting. Seems to me that it is bound to the same fate of Tolkien's books, destined to be a target for the same type of misunderstandings that keep attacking this literary masterpiece many decades after it's first publication.Having read the books several years ago, I went to see this `impossible' film when it came out with many doubts on my mind. I really liked it, but left the theater with as many doubts as I had before. Was it perfect? Well, maybe not, but what an achievement. After watching it a few times on DVD, and thinking about it for some time now, I find myself loving this film more and more. Let me tell you why...The Lord of the Rings is a fairy-tale of myth and fantasy. Peter Jackson directed a film that was considered, for a very long time, impossible to make, and not only for technical reasons. The narrative roots are incredibly long and detailed, and the storyline is deeply connected with the creation of a fantastic continent from a time unknown called `Middle Earth'. It's author, Tolkien, dedicated a considerable part of his life developing this continent's background, it's mythology and origins, it's different kinds of people, cultures and languages, and therefore it's geographic references are determinant to the unfolding of the story of the One Ring.Peter Jackson went out to achieve the impossible and came out with a recreation of the original that is pure and true to the story in every detail. The first time the four hobbits meet a black rider on the road, for example, is absolutely faithful to the feeling of the book. The assault of the riders at Weathertop is another great example, and it captures that feeling of danger, density and atmosphere that are the main characteristics of the tale. Jackson also took some liberties with the story, and made some right choices along the way. If the so called `purists' may not approve the removal of Tom Bombadil altogether, it should be comprehensible that the travel from Hobbiton to Rivendel is a very long and detailed one and could easily make a movie on it's own. I felt more uneasy with how short the Council of Elrond was. In the book, the council is where the whole story of the rings is first explained, and many passages from the past ages of Middle Earth are unveiled. It is a fascinating moment of the story, that had to be shortened for obvious reasons. Still, after some consideration, I now agree with the options made by Peter Jackson, and think that the movie prologue narrated by Galadriel was the wisest choice. The magic is all there when Gandalf shuts his eyes the moment Frodo stands in the council and says `I will take the ring'. It is there at Moria's Gate, and at the fall of Boromir. It is a powerful film that doesn't fit the rhythm of the standard Hollywood action movie. It is a film that breeds, that takes time to unfold, it's tale branching in every direction.I could go on and on, talking about all the different elements that bring this film close to perfection, but I'll end saying that deep down, this is not about action, beards and big monsters. The greatest thing about this film, to me, is that it brought me back to a time when I was in love with a different world where everything was possible. Reading The Lord of the Rings night after night, I came to understand what this thing of `mankind' really was all about. The corruption of absolute power, the importance and value of friendship, the inevitability of growing up, the strength of hope... That this film could capture that magic, and be a new bearer to it's message of humanism, is a statement to it's greatness. Gandalf's words, that even the smallest person may change the course of the world, and have a part to play in the destiny of all, are immortal.In the end, this is a wonderful film, but that doesn't mean you are going to like it. I cannot tell you what it is like to see this film if you don't know or love the book. But I hope it may plant a seed on your heart to discover a great world of fantasy, beauty and humanity. I believe Tolkien would have liked that."
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,15-Feb-20,"It is my firm belief that the standard versions of The Lord of the Rings should be jettisoned in favour of the extended editions universally. Sure, the near 4 hour runtime is a tad steep, but for an absolute masterpiece like this, it's work every second and the first act of undoubtedly the best trilogy in cinematic history!"
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,30-Jan-02,"...but oh was I thankful for it!!! All through the movie I kept on having this big large smile sculpted into my face. For the record, I'm 25 years old, and I've read ""The Lord of the Rings"" in three times for the first time when I was six or seven years old. Ever since then, I read it at least once or twice a year - therefore you can count me as a fan, for I follow the same cult fan procedure with ""The Hobbit"" and ""The Silmarillion"" as well. Now onto the movie... Gosh, I saw it more than one time, and I keep wanting more of it. It just never gets boring! I really enjoyed the little stuff that is found throughout the movie for fans of the books (the map on Bilbo's table in his house comes to mind, it is exactly as the one in ""The Hobbit"" book that I own), and I also incredibly enjoyed the intro sequence with the re-telling of the battle against Sauron from the Silmarillion, never has an ultimate evil being been so well depicted on the screen. It truly is Sauron. Those who argue the movie cuts too many parts or that it changes the story too much are totally wrong. This movie could not have shown the whole first time in its entirety - keep in mind that the audiobook version of 'Fellowship of the Ring' lasts well over ten hours, making a movie this long would, well, make it way too long and besides, how would you financially sustain such a project? I've read a reviewer saying he'd make all three books with the time allowed for the first movie alone. I think it would be a very fast-forwarding experience of a movie with 'Alvin and the Chimpmunks' kind of voices, incredibly stupid to say the least.Ok, so there are changes in the movie - well, this is Jackson's vision of it. All of us have our own visions of the books, which may or may not be compatible with that of Jackson's, but I can safely assume that nobody can say they have a hundred percent the same vision of the story as Tolkien; that's the thing with books: each reader has a different vision of it. As for me, I was blown away. Never before have I felt so much at home in a movie, it is as if I had taken a walk in the town where I grew up, the Shire, Rivendell, Moria, Lorien, everything felt so much like home, I was moved. I cannot tell of another movie that had me shed tears just by seeing a landscape on screen.As for the changes, well, I found good reasons behind all of them, and let me tell you right away, I was happy that Arwen saved Frodo, yes, maybe coming from a fan it will look like absolute heresy, but I enjoyed the scene a lot. I did not enjoy it because it was supposedly politically-correct to do so, or that I find Liv Tyler to be absolutely attractive; it was just because I felt like even though it was a big change from the book, it was a very good one indeed, it makes you discover the power, determination, and courage of elves and the fact that even elven women, although great in their beauty and seemingly fragile in appearance do not have anything to envy to their male counterparts. And beside, as Arwen is to become a Queen later on, it was pretty good to see her have a great first appearance.The actors were great, they were a lot into their characters, and for the first time, I saw elves as they were, quick, agile, terrifyingly effective in battle - just look at how Legolas dealed with the hordes of enemies without a single hint of fear in his eyes - these are elves as they should be. Gimli was great too, I know people seem to think many characters were not developed enough, but by the actions you can learn a lot. With Gimli a lot can be learned about the dwarves, their pride, deep sense of honor and family, their mistrust of elves, their love for strong beer and a good fight against anything bigger, and their sheer hatred for orcs and the likes. Aragorn was totally the ranger character, the ending scene as he walked toward the horde of Uruk-Hai warriors was great, his attitude, his clothes, everything about him just cried ""ranger"". Boromir was very well depicted, desperate to save the people of Gondor, by any mean necessary, robbed of all hope, yet in the end he redeems himself by showing his true valour, deep down, he's willing to die to defeat evil, and when he recognizes his king in Aragorn, on his last breath, I felt like watching a hero die, it was moving. The hobbits were all great, Frodo is deeply sad and fatalist, and Sam is just the 'best friend' everyone would like to have, just as it should be. Finally, we have Gandalf, quite frankly, he looks mighty, Ian IS Gandalf. The faceoff against the Balrog in the Moria is a memorable sequence, and just shows how strong he really is, to be able to vanquish such a foe. I can't wait for his return.Quite frankly, I can't wait for the two other movies... In the meantime, I'll watch this one over and over again. This movie has everything that a good movie needs to have, and more. Plus, it just might bring more people to actually read books that have more pages than the average little 25¢ novel that has no value in it, which is great. Parents, maybe some scenes will frighten your kids, but this movie has almost NO blood (even though it has a good share of battle) and the foes are undeniably evil, plus it has good values in it - friendship, courage, responsiblity, sacrifice for a good cause, and the belief that anyone can help to change things. This is worthy of Tolkien, this is a movie that will go down in history as being one of the best ever, for sure."
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,07-Mar-06,"Here is one film that lived up to its hype, and by the time I saw it after it had arrived at the video stores, I had heard and read a ton of things about it, and seen all the awards it had received, and expected a lot. To my surprise, it did not disappoint.Now, several years later after having watched all three of these ""Rings"" films twice each, I still think this first movie of the trilogy is the best. It is a truly spectacular adventure story all the way through, probably the best ever put to film...and the first three hours of it is extra special. The following two films were very good, to be sure, but this first had a better mixture of the story. The second and third movies were almost entirely Frodo and his allies' long journey, but the first half of this movie also gives a good bit of interesting introductory material including a number of scenes at the Shire, before the long adventure starts. If you watch all three of these films consecutively the action wears you down by midway through the final episode and it almost becomes just too much That never gets a chance to happen with the ""Fellowship"" film.Anyway, ""Fellowship,"" stunned me for the visuals alone. I can't recall any film that has so many jaw-dropping scenes, one after the other, for three straight hours. Some are beyond description, and I don't care if they are computer- generated. So what? The fact is they are awesome to view, both in beauty and in staggering action scenes that feature incredible-looking monsters and other mythical characters.The story covers all kinds of terrain, too, from the lush Shire of the Hobbits, to the harsh neighboring landscapes. Each couple of minutes, as in the two movies that followed, scenes radically change from calmness to action, adventure to romance, sweet lovable characters to hideous monsters, on and on and on. It's an incredible movie experience."
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,22-Dec-01,"I think it is important to remember that Peter Jackson took up this film not in order just to make a film of `The Lord of the Rings' but because he wanted to make a 'fantasy just like the `The Lord of the Rings'"" as he himself put it.  After repeating that phrase on a number of occasions the question popped into his mind: ""Well, why not the `The Lord of the Rings' itself?"".  In doing this he, of course, set himself an enormous challenge: he had to make a really good `fantasy' film, one which would stand on its own and be true to what he had originally wanted to do but he would also, and here the task he had set himself was enormous, be true to the original book and to make a film which the legions of people who have loved this book would feel happy with.  In the latter task he was certainly not helped by the author or the book: Tolkein, it would seem, hated cinema.  The book itself is `HUGE': this was not going to be the kind of task that the James Ivory team set themselves, or Scorsese nor the kind of task facing Branagh with Hamlet; nor was it going to be like the puny task that faced Columbus with `Harry Potter' who had the bigger budget ($130 million for one film as compared with Peter Jackson with $300m for three).I have just seen the first `volume' and can say without hesitation that he has succeeded in both his goals.  It is not the book but a reading of the book which is inventive and fascinating.  It is the kind of experience that makes you want to go back and reread the whole thing in the light of the emphases that Jackson has brought to the story.  He focuses on the corrupting influence of the ring and, through this focus, the character of the chief protagonists of the story are revealed.  Clearly those most tempted by it are mortal men (Boromir and even, in one moment, Aragorn), those who already have power (Elrond - `The ring cannot stay here'; Galadriel; Gandalf and Saruman),  and, of course, those who would not normally desire it but who by accident become ring bearers - Gollum, Bilbo, Frodo.  I can see why, in this reading, Jackson decided to leave out the Bombadil episode.  Bombadil, like the Balrog, is beyond the ring but the latter is important to the unfolding of the story of the fates of all the characters, Bombadil isn't.It is a miracle of this reading of the first volume of the book that one can see where Jackson is going and one can get a feel of how the reading is going to unfold.  In a sense, Jackson's real trial - as far as those who know the books are concerned - will come with the second film in the series. He has lived up to our expectation by creating even bigger ones: how can he handle the story of the chase andrescue of Merry and Pippin, the storming of Isengard etc - stories which don't really add much to the core theme that is emerging.  Or is he now going to add the theme of the great contest of good versus evil to the unfolding reading?All of this points to the fact that the film, even though it is a feast of special effects, focuses on character.  And this also explains why Jackson chose the actors he did for their roles: they are not `big' names - no `Sean Connery', no `Alan Rickman', no `Brad Pitt', no `Sam Neill'etc.  He didn't want them getting in the way of the story of character.  Ian McKellan's talents, in particular, are used to tell a large proportion of the story: an enormous amount is conveyed simply through his facial expressions and even by the language of his body. The other miracle in all of this is Elijah Wood.  Like many others, when I first heard of Jackson's choice, I groaned: but Wood has been extraordinary.  He brings, as one friend said, a strange kind of androgyny to the role and this is just perfect. McKellan has already been knighted: give Wood the Oscar.And then there is Middle Earth: this is, as someone put it, another character in the story and the New Zealand landscape, digitally enhanced on occasion, lives up to its role too.Enough.  See this film!  Greatest film ever made?  How can one make a claim like that! Silly really; as silly as claiming that `The Lord of the Rings' is the greatest book ever written.  Can't one simply love a story, enjoy reading it a number of times amd lose oneself in it.  One CAN claim that it is the greatest work in its genre as is the film.10/10"
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,14-Apr-06,"The first part of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, the Fellowship of the Rings opened the door to a whole new world for me. I'd never read any of Tolkien's books when I saw the film for the first time at the theatre and, now that I've read them, in retrospect I think being a neophyte to the mythology made my LOTR movie experience all the more miraculous.I loved The Two Towers and Return of the King almost as much as FOTR, but not quite, because seeing Fellowship for the first time was like taking a journey to a fabulous new place and meeting incredible new friends that you don't want to leave. I've never felt anything quite like what this epic evoked in me. It was akin to being a child again, with that tireless sense of wonder and enjoyment of each and every moment, maybe because as a child you are discovering your surroundings, and whatever age you are, when you watch the Fellowship of the Ring you are rendered in awe upon being introduced to the purity and beauty of Middle Earth and darkly enthralled by the majesty of Eisengard, Saruman, Sauron and all of their mighty malice. One of the things that makes this movie so special (and there are so many!) is that you fall in love not only with the ""good"" characters, but also with the ""evil"" ones. For example, Christopher Lee was amazing as Saruman, and I can't imagine the movie without him.Some films that might be comparable to the Lord of the Rings trilogy are: The Fifth Element, the Star Wars Trilogy parts IV, V and VI (forget the newer prequels), the Matrix trilogy (especially the first part), Interview with a Vampire, the Legend of Sleepy Hollow (with Johnny Depp), Logan's Run and The Island. They are all excellent movies and works of art that weave that movie magic that keeps you spellbound and entranced for the duration of their runtime.But after seeing The Fellowship of the Ring, I knew I had found the movie by which I would judge all other movies. Based on J.R.R. Tolkien's beloved books, Peter Jackson has set a new standard in the industry of cinema, one that I honestly think has not and won't be surpassed, at least not in my lifetime, not even by PJ himself.It is truly an instant classic that will stand the test of time and be loved by generations to come. God Bless Tolkien and Jackson and everyone involved in the conception and making of this film, for creating a world that is at my fingertips, only takes the touch of a button to go to whenever I want, and makes me forget everything else.The LOTR Trilogy is undoubtedly MY precious, the non plus ultra of all movies!"
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,17-Feb-02,"When I first saw the trailers for ""The Fellowship of the Ring,"" I had never had any interest in reading the lengthy tome of a trilogy.  But seeing the possibility of the movie, I immediately went out and read the whole thing, insisted on receiving it for Christmas, and enjoyed every minute of it. The feelings I had while reading the series were heightened seeing it come to life in the stunning movie.  I thought it was a fabulous work of art.I thought that having Galadriel tell what was basically the prologue of the book was a good idea, as it helped those who had never read the story.  It also immediately involved me in the film; I felt I had an insider's advantage on the rest of the audience.  Cate Blanchett has a wonderfully deep and emotional voice; the way she speaks Galadriel is almost as effective as her appearence as the Elven queen.  Also, showing the last battle of Isildur and Sauron helped unfog a part of the novel that had me a trifle confused.The entire movie is full of beautiful sets and landscapes.  The Shire was almost exactly as I'd pictured it.  Hobbiton is cute and very whimsical. Mordor was frighteningly well done, extremely real.  Rivendell had a little bit of a European-tourist-trap look, but was beautiful all the same.  The entire backdrop of the movie (the mountains, Moria, Isengard) was perfect; it's amazing that ""Fellowship"" was filmed in one country.Now to the characters.  All I can say is, ""Wow.""  I was a little apprehensive about the casting at first; I'd created such real images of the characters in my imagination, I almost didn't want them spoiled for me. However, I was not disapointed in the least.  Elijah Wood, though not one of my favorite actors, was believable.  You could tell from the first glimpse that Frodo was special; Wood's pale, sharp features contrast sharply with the more ruddy, robust look of the rest of the hobbits.  He also cries like a little girl.  But his weaknesses and strengths make his Frodo an apt choice for the starring character.  The rest of the Hobbiton gang was well-chosen, too.  Sean Astin (""Rudy"" forever to me) was loyal and a bit bumbling, just like the Gamgee of Tolkien's telling.  Pippin and Merry were congenial, slow-witted lads, but very brave nonetheless.  Viggo Mortensen is outstanding.  He has the ability to make Aragorn both menacing and kind. He physically represents Strider to the nines with his strength and virility; the action sequences of his are very passionate and exciting.  Some may have complained about Arwen's character being slightly expanded; I thought it a good change.  In the books, you have to read the whole trilogy and then rifle through the appendix in ""The Return of the King"" to learn the history between Aragorn and Arwen.  Liv Tyler is ethereal and breathtaking, but at the same time displays the courage and magic that make the Elves the beings they are.  Speaking of Elves, I can't help but gush over the handsome and ever-so-talented Orlando Bloom as noble Legolas.  Bloom captured the archer's very movements; he treads lightly and fights fearlessly. Legolas's bowmanship was amazing; he looked so natural loosing his arrows machine-gun style.  He was my favorite character in the books, and his essence transcends the film.  Gimli was pompous and brave, as well.  He is well-represented in the movie.  Boromir was hopelessly lost, but at the same time valiant and strong.  Sean Bean gave an emotionally-charged performance as the tortured warrior.  Hugo Weaving was very good as Elrond.  He was noble and cold at the same time.  And Gandalf.  What more can be said of Ian McKellan's showcase portrayal of the wizard?  He was magnificent.  He could be Gandalf, the kind old conjurer who set off pyrotechnics for hobbit-children.  Then he could turn around and stun the life out of you with Gandalf the powerful wizard, facing the balrog with defiance and an iron will.  His Oscar nomination is well-deserved.Peter Jackson is a brave soul to take on a project that could have backfired in so many places.  Instead of bringing us uninspired kitsch, he serves up raw emotion, graphic battles of good and evil, chilling and wonderful characters, and enough special effects (realistic, mind you) to make John Cameron's mouth water.  Knowing that ""The Two Towers"" was my favorite of the books, I eagerly anticipate the second helping of ""The Lord of the Rings."""
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,25-Nov-02,"Star Wars has been dethroned.  Although George Lucas' movies are good in their own right (except for the juvenile elements he puts in to sell toys to finance the franchise), his scripts (which borrow heavily from J.R.R.Tolkien, mythology & religion) can't compare with the brilliance of the literary trilogy `The Lord of the Rings'.  Granted, Lucas took on a herculean task in writing & directing his story himself, but Tolkien's words, along with Peter Jackson's faithful adaptation & inspired vision, have created something no one man could equal. Of course, it helps that Jackson insisted on at least a 2 picture deal, & New Line Cinema was brave enough to foot the bill up front for 3 movies. They spent $180 million to film all 3 simultaneously.  With the New Zealand exchange rate, that equals $360 million ($90 million ea.), but since they used many of the same sets, and FX development costs were spread throughout, we're seeing $120-$150 million on the screen.  This will ensure consistency in plot, casting, tone, etc.In 3 hours, Jackson has crammed everything essential from the first novel & then some into the film, rewriting some scenes & dialogue with lesser characters for the leads, leaving out only what there wasn't enough time for.  Basically, you have two 90 min. movies running back to back.  There are no slow spots, just one climax after another.  From the opening 10 min. backstory where the Dark Lord Sauron is shown on the battlefield wiping out men & elves 10 at a time with each swing of his mace, I was blown away.  The romance between Aragorn, king in exile, and Arwen, daughter of the elf-lord, is played up for the ""Titanic"" quotient, but it's well done. The story, sets, costumes & FX are so rich, you'll have to see the film several times to absorb everything.  The unspoiled New Zealand locales are spectacular, providing a variety of environments to represent the different settings on the characters' journey.  The location sets are imaginative, detailed & weathered, adding to their believability, while the studio sets match them in meticulousness.  The costumes are at once familiar & strange, drawing on both the medievil & the fantastic, but more important, they're also functional & practical.  The music by Howard Shore is appropriately sweeping, Celtic & folky in keeping with the novel, although it lacks the memorable themes of John Williams or Jerry Goldsmith, but neither would commit a year or more to a 3 picture project.  The FX are as they should be, unobtrusive & unnoticed most of the time, there only to support the story not draw attention away from it as in most Hollywood movies which try to coverup illogical plots & bad acting. I'm particularly gratified by the casting of Viggo Mortenson as Aragorn which was a last minute stroke of luck when the actor first chosen for the part backed out due to differences with the director.  I've always thought Mortenson had an intensity & striking but not pretty-boy looks that could portray a flawed, dangerous hero instead of the villains Hollywood always picked him for.A stellar cast giving some of their best performances, visuals that deliver beyond what I imagined, a perfect mix of humor, passion & tragedy, and a feeling of grandeur, scope & impending doom.  Perhaps as an ensemble piece with so many characters & the inability to concentrate on any one, it can't be measured against some of the classic character study films, but even the casual moviegoer can grasp the ideas & not get lost  As far as I'm concerned, it's one of the greatest films of all time."
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,25-Jul-02,"I think I can watch this film a billion times and not get bored. Today I saw LOTR for the third time and I noticed a few details.When Frodo is stabbed with the blade from the dark rider and the hobbits and Aragorn are in the forrest u can see 3 huge stone trolls in the background. To understand who they are you have to read The hobbit. - When the fellowship is traveling over the mountains everyone is walking IN the snow, except for Legolas who is walking ON the snow. The is because Elves are so light.Well when I saw these details I realised that Peter Jackson was even a greater director then I thought. And for the people who think that there are too much 'ring-shots' (sounds like a word from a porn movie) in the movie: THE MOVIE IS CALLED THE LORD OF THE RINGS GODDAMMIT, THE RING IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN THE ENTIRE MOVIE! Some say that the movie is too long. It may be long but I never ever get bored watching. This movie is just brilliant, mayB just as brilliant as the book."
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,26-Aug-08,"Barely ever hearing of The Lord of the Rings, I went in to see this film in theaters the consecutive Friday it was released, to not only be flabbergasted at its greatness, but wanting more! Since then, I devoted myself to seeing the following two films on the first day of release -- a promise I kept.Peter Jackson's take on Tolkien's fantasy masterpiece not only carries a great deal of the text to full film fruition, but shows the power of film, and proving that nothing is impossible. Jackson's vision is continuous, and never seems to loose grasp of the story that is being told. Using the artistry of John Howe and Alan Lee, The Fellowship of the Ring gleams with a beautiful and dark atmosphere, a length of detail that makes it seem like everyone and everything has its own history, and full of wondrous images one could never imagine.The acting is superb. With a complex script, each actor has transformed these characters into 3-D people with deep back-story, and people that we feel compassion for. This is one extraordinary ensemble cast. Each actor IS that character, making it seem impossible to imagine anyone else fill that person's shoe in their stead. Viggo Mortensen IS Aragorn. Sir Ian McKellen IS Gandalf the Grey. Elijah Wood IS Frodo Baggins. One could weep with our heroes should one fall, or feel inspired when they achieve victory. A fantasy with this much emotion just seems surreal, but it's completely believable.Never losing pace, the writing and direction is flawless, making for one enthralling introduction into Middle-earth. The voice over prologue fills even the most uneducated audience member with all the necessary knowledge they need to know in order to understand our heroes' and villains' motives. Some things of course have been omitted for pacing reasons. While not present in the theatrical cut, we do see the passing of the Grey Elves, and get a brief tale of Beren and Luthien. The barrow-wights and their story is no where to be seen (as interesting as it is in the book, there really is no place for it in this film) and Tom Bombadil is absent as well, but thankfully to the ingeniousness of the writers, in the Extended Edition of The Two Towers a little homage is paid to the character. Omissions and changes are always part of adapting a book to film, and the ones made by Peter Jackson, Phillipa Boyens and Fran Walsh are justifiable in every way.The action scenes are spaced out thoroughly enough for breathing room, plot advancement, and ever-continuing character development. Each action scene is its own, be it the flight to the Fjords of Bruinen, the Mines of Moria, or the showdown at Amon Hen near the end of the film. All are greatly choreographed, each stunt member and actor is full of energy and ambition as they wield deadly weapons at each others' heads and limbs. It really is a sight to behold.The special effects are mesmerizing. The use of CGI, miniatures/bigatures, and even clever camera angles blend to make one ideal image after the other. The soaring images of Barad-dur or Orthanc seem real when in fact, they only stand so many feet high. The Argonath, two figures of enormous height standing before the Anduin River seem like 300 foot creations, when in fact they are about only several feet off the ground. Simply jaw-dropping imagery.Howard Shore's score for The Fellowship of the Ring is a beautiful, epic, and complex piece of work that makes one feel like they have been entranced. Even when some of the text seems omitted from the screen, it can be heard through the powerful instrumentation conducted and created by this composer. The use of leitmotifs to symbolize a country, race, or character is stunning.Overall, The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring is a visionary masterpiece, allowing the world to see what seems like actual history with fantastic elements, equaling the greatness of Hollywood's earlier classics. As the first of three, one who has not seen these films can await the next several hours of their lives to be changed for ever."
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,23-Sep-08,"I confess to say that I did not see the first two LOTR films in theaters. The fact of the matter was that my sister was 6 years old and scared easily, so my father wouldn't take her. So, my father went on his own to see them. I did, however get to see Return of the King in theaters. I was entranced. I was 12 years old at the time, and I didn't understand the story. But I was captivated. When Pippin sang his song, I was in tears. At the very end, I was sobbing. The sense of beauty it had...I couldn't even describe it. So, I watched the first two movies respectively with my father. And now I was within Middle-Earth. I read the books the same month that I saw all three films. Simultaneously, in fact. That is my admiration story.What can I say about this movie that won't fill a novel? Where do I start? I suppose with Peter Jackson. I was so struck to learn how these beautiful works of art, Tolkien's magnum opus, inspired him to want to take on such a daunting yet gratifying task. He saw more in those books than I had read from them, and I'm glad that a dedicated fan brought these jewels to screen. Thank you, Mr. Jackson! The cast? Absolutely beautiful. Their friendship is so apparent, so close, not faked as you see in many other movies. Not one actor in those three films were bad. Yes, you heard me. So those of you who said that the casting was terrible, let me say to you: ""Not all those who wander are lost.""Elijah Wood, who is a very gifted and bright young man, has such an incredible beauty (inside and out) to portray such a conflicted and fatalistic character. His own striking idealism, innocence, and understanding was such that you fell in love with Frodo at first sight, but not to the point where he seemed weak. Elijah is Frodo incarnate, and anyone else would have ruined the role.Sean Astin, another very bright young man, shows his warm wisdom as Samwise, as well as a courage the likes of which I have never seen before in any performance. He had such an aura of honesty and kindliness that it shone like a light on screen. His friendship with Frodo (Elijah respectively) is so obvious and true on-screen, and not a sappy, cheesy ""Hollywood"" special. Friendships that are too sappy (and fake) will kill a movie, but this one was so obviously real and strong that it touched we fans in such a deep way (for those who could appreciate it).I can't say everything I would like to about these movies. The marriage of deep friendship, dedication, and beautiful, realistic special effects creates an entrancing epic that will be hard to rival by any movie. Those who negatively rated these movies, did you actually pay any attention to the screen as you watched the movie? For those who have never seen these movies, please, do. The deep bonds shared by these actors, all of them, are so beautifully shown, and the cast clearly underwent a lot of stress (For those who own the Extended Versions of these movies, you might hear some horror stories from Astin, Wood, Mortensen, Serkis, and more, if you listen to the documentaries/commentaries), but it is clear that they love their roles, and it shines through in their voices, their faces, and especially their acting.I neglected to mention the efforts of the crew. Without them, over 5,000 people strong, these movies would not have been possible. They created Middle Earth in such way that it seemed possible to be a shadow of our past: a past world on Earth that faded away long before our time. Thanks be to them.Yes, there are differences from the books. There always are, in any adaptation. I saw that some people commented about how weak a character they thought Frodo seemed compared to the book, because several moments in which he looks Evil in the face were shortened/changed in the film version. That isn't true. Not at all. True heroism means not only defending others, but accepting aid from others. True heroism means that one accepts that they can't do everything alone, and accepts the aid of those willing to give it. THAT is true heroism. Frodo shows that in every light, even if it isn't always obvious. You can see with much more than your eyes...Overall, if these were the last movies I thought worthwhile enough to watch (I hope cinema doesn't become that bad), it would be fine by me. Thanks to all of the people who brought this to us, the LOTR fans. To my fellow fans, I say: ""May it be a light for you in dark places, when all other lights go out."" 10/10, and then some."
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,27-Mar-02,"LOTR is without a doubt, the best movie I've ever seen. I don't care what the Academy says because without a doubt, it was the best film of 2001 (obviously... i said it was the best movie I've ever seen). It deserved the Academy Award 10 times more than A Beautiful Mind did. I mean look at the difference between ratings. LOTR: #3 ABM: #126 See a difference? LOTR will go on to be an unforgotten movie as what Star Wars is. In twenty years ABM won't even be on the top 250 list, while LOTR will still be in the top 50. SO LOTR fans just remember. Academy doesn't mean sh*t. Time says it all."
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,30-Nov-07,"Peter Jackson set out to make movies which the author of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, J.R.R. Tolkien would have endorsed. All three were resounding successes, though because of the film medium they necessarily varied from Tolkien's story-line. Purists may have issues with Jackson's theatrical license, but as someone who has read Tolkien's books several times and seen the films 4-5 times each, I never felt that Jackson went too far or compromised Tolkien's story, the mythology he developed or the wonderful characters he brought to life. Many have said what Jackson did could not be done. He has not only proved the nay-sayers wrong, but lovingly crafted a set of films which will, for many decades to come, stand out as a great achievement. This is the first of three reviews I am publishing on IMDb for these films. I am labeling them Parts 1, 2, and 3 just in case anybody wants to read them in order. The reviews will be self-contained, but will also be enhanced by a chronological reading. My reviews will focus on the extended edition DVDs, though my comments are also relevant to the theatrical releases.The Fellowship of the Ring introduces the key characters and the broad story arc of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Wizard Gandalf the Grey travels to a small town for small people (Hobbits)to help celebrate Bilbo Baggins' birthday. The very elderly Baggins doesn't look a day over 45, and soon it becomes apparent why. Since the great adventure of his life, a quest he was sent on by Gandalf himself, he has possessed the most powerful object in all of Middle Earth  The One Ring. This ring is evil incarnate, with an insatiable lust for power, it taints every creature who possesses it and tries to work its way back to its creator  Dark Lord Sauron. Bilbo uses the ring to disappear, as he intends to spend his senescence with his friends the Elves in Rivendell. But activating the ring, he draws the attention of Lord Sauron from thousands of miles away in the land of Mordor. Realizing what has occurred, Gandalf scrambles to determine a course of action and recruits Bilbo's nephew Frodo and his loyal gardener Samwise to bear the ring to the Council of Elrond in Rivendell. Thusly, the seeds of the fellowship are planted in the soil of the Shire.At this point, we are about 1/6th of the way through The Fellowship. Fairly soon thereafter, it becomes clear who will compose the fellowship, and who and what these people are. Though the succeeding films are not entitled ""Fellowship"", they follow the adventures of the surviving central characters. Characterization is done just as Tolkien did it in the original novel  by example not discourse. For example, we are given hints to the identity of Strider (Mortenson) earlier on in the movie than in the novel, but the actual significance of this remains ambiguous until about midway through. Strong characterization is key to the success of the entire trilogy. To summarize, Peter Jackson, his team and cast  NAIL the characterization. The casting and acting is perfect. It is very difficult to resist the temptation to single out Mortenson and McKellen for carrying their difficult roles so well (Strider/Aragorn and Gandalf), but why risk diminishing the contributions of the rest of the cast? Nobody mis-steps, and it is clear from the beginning that the entire cast was thoroughly and completed engaged with the task before them.Tolkien believed that no film would ever do his work justice, and until this trilogy, he was correct.Peter Jackson and his team have managed to do exactly what they set out to. As Jackson himself has said in reference to the film trilogy, they set out to 'make Tolkien's film.' Jackson successfully drew out elements of all three books, expanding and contracting, rearranging, and sometimes adding whole subplots which are hinted at in the books, but not well explained, in order to adopt the grand story to the film medium. Arwen (Liv Tyler), daughter of Elrond and Elven lover of Aragorn, for example, is introduced early in the films and plays a role in the films which is much more equal to her significance than it was in the books.The Howard Shore score is lovely, and its simple themes are used to great effect throughout all three movies. The musical collaborations improvising on Shore's basic themes are great, and, though they feature some prominent performers  are never weighed down by star-power.Jackson made all three movies simultaneously. This technique allowed for perfect continuity, and permitted much greater flexibility in editing and post-production work than would normally be allowed. Knowing that he would need to establish and support his own fellowship to make this production work, he also knew that success would make the production legendary. So, he documented the creation of the films beautifully. Two complete DVDs full of documentary pieces are included in all three Special Edition Packages in the trilogy. Many are likely to be bored by the details in these documentaries, but those interested in the creative process behind the films will be provided with a more comprehensive view than I can remember ever seeing in any similar DVD package. The Fellowship of the Rings is as true a representation of Tolkien's novel as can be imagined. Although some aspects of the stories in the novel were adapted to the screen, the essentials, the characters, and the overall story are not just recognizable, but ENHANCED by the film. What results is a film that is not just entertaining, but an enormous fulfillment of an undying wish of millions of fans around the world.Very highly recommended."
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,13-Apr-03,"'The Lord of the Rings' is one of my favorite books, I have read it several times, and remember thinking the last time, about 3 years ago that if I made a film I'd want to make it of this, but wouldn't it be almost impossible. You can then imagine how strong my expectations were when I went to see the eagerly awaited first installment.This film impressed me hugely, more than anything else because of how true it was to my imagination, both in the characters as well as in the effects and setting- a sentiment I have heard consistently from other fans of the books. Elijah Wood brought across the character of Frodo with the kind of haunted, frail courage that Tolkien captures so well in the books. Nor could I find any fault at all with Ian McKellan's Gandalf, Viggo Mortensen's Aragorn, and Sean Bean's Boromir, all of whom I thought were portrayed excellently. I could pick out instances where I did think, 'no, that's not right', however their seldomness in number would only serve to illustrate the excellence of the overall portrayal. One thing that did stand out for me was Cate Blanchett's performance as Galadriel, the part itself became so perfunctory in the film that to me her alternation between benevolent seer, and figure of potential terror seemed little more than a slightly confusing detour with no real connection into the plot other than as a vehicle for a glimpse into the future. But that was it.I thought that the points where Jackson did deviate from the text were completely the correct ones to do so. Shortening the opening Shire scenes and cutting out the whole Tom Bombadil bit was great since frankly they bored me slightly in the book anyway. Also, expanding the role of Arwen was a sensible decision.However this film is by no means above criticism. The dialogue was in my opinion terrible and purely there to drive on the plot. Normally this would ruin a film for me (as in ""The Matrix""), making it almost intolerable to view, however fortunately here it proves little more than a minor irritation. Also, the film seemed overall to be excessively plot-driven and at times a mad dash from one action scene to another, the characters, for all their truth to the book did seem flat and sometimes little more than stereotypical fantasy characters. This is perhaps my major quarrel with the film- I would have liked these characters to have come alive as people in a way that was made impossible by the sparseness of the script and the rollercoaster nature of the plot. In general the whole film lacked the depth of context that I think distinguishes Tolkien from other fantasy writers. However to have achieved this would have required a very different movie, and you can't fault an action film for being an action film.This movie is undoubtedly not for everyone. A lot of people just don't get fantasy- other than Lord of the Rings, I don't particularly either. However in my opinion Jackson really has made an incredible achievement- his and Tolkien's vision carried through suberbly by a breathtaking setting and stunning special effects, as well as by a cast clearly as enthralled as he was. He has taken on a huge task, and is dealing with it with breathtaking success. Check for other user comments."
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,28-Feb-06,"There is very little that can be said about The Lord of the Rings that hasn't been said already many times over. But what can be re-iterated is that The Fellowship of the Ring is an outstanding piece of film-making.Where do you start when reviewing a film the size of Lord of the Rings? J.R.R. Tolkein's seminal masterwork, long considered unfilmable, has made it on to the screen thanks to visionary director Peter Jackson. The Fellowship of the Ring is the first of the three books of the trilogy. Everyone has their favourite of the three, and this one is probably mine. Unrivalled in its size and scale by virtually any other film, with new groundbreaking special and digital effects, a stunning musical score, universally superb acting and most importantly a superb story.The Fellowship of the Ring is the first part of the epic trilogy that tells of the quest of a hobbit to destroy an evil ring of power. He is aided in his quest by his friends and other companions who accompany him and protect him on his journey. Many threats face him on his long journey, both from the world around him and from his companions, who could be tempted by the power of the ring he has set out to destroy. It is a tale of magic and fantasy, swords and sorcery, but it is not simply for teens who enjoy dungeons and dragons games. It is accessible to everyone. By turns exciting, frightening, funny and sad, it is a true masterpiece in terms of storytelling, encompassing the full spectrum of emotions.The acting is superb from the entire cast, and it is unfathomable as to how the Academy overlooked the acting entirely for all three films when dishing out awards and nominations. However the performances from Ian McKellan, Viggo Mortensen, Sean Astin, Elijah Wood and Sean Bean are all so good it would have possibly been greatly unfair to single any one out for an award.The film also contains some groundbreaking computer-generated special effects, and some positively genius scale work. Due to hobbits being only about 3 feet tall, some clever scale work was needed in order to ensure that John Rhys-Davies, a dwarf in the film but over 6 feet tall in real life, did in fact look the height of a dwarf. This was done through clever use of forced perspectives, scale doubles, giant sets and blue screen filming. However, the most impressive use of computer effects lies later in the trilogy, with the appearance of Gollum  cinema's first live-action character who is completely computer generated. The music is also beautiful, and Howard Shore has created possibly the most iconic and memorable score since John Williams' Star Wars.Peter Jackson has, until Lord of the Rings, been seen as a director outside of the mainstream, but his superb, career-defining work on the Lord of the Rings trilogy has seen him well and truly propelled him to the forefront of Hollywood. He has re-defined the epic film with unparalleled success, and created films that will definitely stand the test of time, to one day be thought of with the same reverence as the Star Wars and Godfather trilogies.A major milestone in cinema history, the trilogy would eventually gain seventeen Oscars between the three films. Lord of the Rings is a master class in storytelling, and essential viewing."
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,07-Aug-03,"This film is a triumph in almost every aspect.  I had never read the books upon seeing the film and was a little sceptical about what many people were claiming that it would change the way films were made.  Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring has become my favorite movie of all time.  And I have seen a lot of freaking movies.Every aspect of the film works.  The cast works their respective roles to perfection with Ian McKellen(Gandalf), Elijah Wood(Frodo), Viggo Mortensen(Aragorn), Sean Bean(Boromir), and Sean Astin(Sam) being the standouts.  From the epic prologue of the film you realize that there is a great, epic journey ahead of you.  And along the way you meet and care for every single character in the film.Director Peter Jackson has really crafted a beautiful piece of work that will be remembered for ages.  It's a perfect balance of action and great character moments.  Character development is not sacrificed for more action like so many other films of its like.  There are many moments of the film that make you realize this is more than just your typical fantasy film, moments that transcend filmmaking and have a profound effect on you. The last 30 minutes are particularly powerful and moving.Basically, this film is an epic, incredible experience.  A film that will be looked at years down the road as a great piece of filmmaking.  If you're a fan of good fantasy, or if you're just a fan of great movies, you'll love this film, plain and simple."
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,13-Apr-02,"Growing up, my dad would always tell me his favorite books were The Lord of the Rings volumes.  But I was never interested in fantasies, so I didn't really care.  Then I found out that Peter Jackman was making the movies so I told my dad.  He became really excited.  But still, I didn't care.  Until one night in November, when they showed the LOTR special on TV.  I was able to catch only the first ten, fifteen minutes and instantly, I wanted to see the movie.  I had never read the books.  My dad took me and my family to see the movie.  I was a bit excited and curious to see how they would do it. Mind you, I knew next to nothing about this story.I sat through the entire three hours in Middle Earth and fell in love with it. Through parts, I would clutch on my brother's arm, tense and hoping that everyone will make it through a lot of the sticky situations they were in. I fell in love with Legolas and his graceful Elf self.  The minute the movie began, I was drawn in.  The special effects were terrific.  I felt like I was there.  I wanted (and still do) to live in Rivendell among the Elves. The backdrops for the movies was fantastic.  Sir Ian McKellan's quote about how New Zealand is Middle Earth is so true.I was very impressed with the casting.  I'm a huge movie buff so I have seen plenty of movies and I won't be lying when I say that LOTR has the best casting ever.  Every person, the mains and the extras, WAS the character they played.  The make-up was incredible.  The orcs creeped me out.  The Elves entranced me.  The Hobbits brought a smile to my face.  Elrond, Hugo Weaving, is the perfect Elf King, firm and commanding, yet with love for his people and respect for Frodo.  I could go on and on, but I won't.I loved the fact how PJ was able to make the Hobbits look small in every single scene.  I would LOVE to know HOW in the world they did that.  I love how the Elves are so graceful and look ethereal.I know that the movie is three hours long and people balk at that.  I took a friend of mine who hasn't seen the movie because it was three hours long. He loved it.  He was engrossed and he had never read the book either. This movie is one of the, if not THE, finest piece of work I have seen.  I eagerly await ""The Two Towers"" and ""The Return of the King"".  I definitely recommend this movie for everyone to see at least once.  I have seen it four times and will see it yet again soon.  I can never get bored of this movie. Go.  See it.I leave you with a quote from Gandalf: ""All we have to decide is what to do with the time that we are given"""

The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,07-Mar-02,"Minor SpoilersI finally got to see the Lord of the Rings a few days ago in the theatre and I must I was very thrilled see a huge movie of this stature. For months I wanted to see this because of several reasons but the biggest one of them was Christopher Lee! I knew he was going to be awesome in this movie which he was.This cast was great and it was a treat seeing Ian Holm in it aswell.I knew LOTR was going to be one of the greatest movies ever and I just love the scenery in this movie and the special effects were flawless and it has great music by Howard Shore. There was so much in the three hour movie that I can`t explain it all but I will say it has great battles and sword fights,and seeing the variety of character is neat like wizards,trolls,dwarfs,hobbits,elvs,and among other creatures and a awesome prolouge.This in MY opinion ranks up in the greatest of films and this is on MY favorites list now just not fantasy movies like Willow and Legend but other of MY favorites like other great films such The Mummy/The Mummy Returns,Planet of the Apes (2001),Jurassic Park trilogy,Star Wars (all four of them),Gladiator,Terminator 2,Predator,and others.I just can`t wait for the sequels to come.Be sure to get all of the LOTR action figures by Toy Biz and they look great! I was very happy to see this film and I hope everyone gets a chance to see this epic!"
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,16-Aug-02,"I've never been a fan of the sword and sorcery genre . I'm surprised film companies decide to make rubbish like THE BEASTMASTER, HAWK THE SLAYER and RED SONJA but I am aware of the popularity of JRR Tolkien's massive novel LORD OF THE RINGS and of it's popularity , I remember in a survey carried out by a very well known British fantasy/SF magazine in 1987 Tolkien's book was voted the greatest fantasy novel of all time ( THE STAND by Stephen King was a long way second ) , but it's a novel that has always struck me as being read by anoraks who - like fans of STAR TREK and STAR WARS - insist on reading subtexts that are just not there . When the THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RINGS shot to number one in the IMDb top 250 films I put the popularity down to obsessed anorakish fans who were going to vote the film a classic no matter what . Stranger still I found groups as diverse as neo Nazis to gays to enviromentalists proclaiming "" This is our film "" so when I finally sat down to watch TFOTR I was expecting only some average entertainment for a non sad person with no political axe to grind . After seeing the film I had to admit THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING is a masterpiece .Much of the credit must go to the producers . I 've no idea of the politics about bringing the story to the silver screen but I can imagine the Hollywood bigwigs sitting around the commitee table saying "" Give us Tom , give us Nicole , get Harrison , get Leonardo . No limeys . Limeys are slimy . No limey accents . We're Americans , this is our baby "" to which the producers gave a firm and resounding "" No "" . Good for them because the Hollywood treatment would have ruined this film. The cast comprised of well known - but not megastar - actors and unknowns are uniformally excellent even the normally hammy Lee and Rhys Davis and the bland Tyler are good . Also great to see so many Brits playing good guys and having the American actors adopting non specific British accents .The cast do a good jobThe other production values are outstanding . Pride of place goes to Andrew Lesnie's cinematography where the camera sweeps down from the sky into the Orcs underground lair and the camera also shows off the stunning New Zealand landscapes . I'd always believed Scotland had the greatest scenery on Earth but I'm willing to change my mind . The FX are good throughout though perhaps the matte backgrounds and CGI are less impressive in places but they're still a lot better than we've been used to recently . The Orc make up is wonderful and helps them become classic cinema monsters . The only bad point about the Orcs is - Like the stormtroopers in STAR WARS - they're too easy to kill .There are some minor flaws to THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RINGS but this is probably down to Tolkien's source novel rather than the film makers . A couple of times the heroes seem set to suffer a resounding defeat when something not obvious at first like flammable villains or a giant eagle saves the day . I guess this is cancelled out by the dangers and adversaries also appearing from nowhere and there's little female perspective in the story for the women in the audience to relate to but come on girls you've got Viggo Mortensen and Sean Bean acting all hunky and macho so you can't complain.I see the IMDb reviewers have started a backlash against FOTR like they did with TITANIC and GLADIATOR . They're right about the gawd awful rubbish that is TITANIC but they're wrong about GLADIATOR which is a very good film and even further wrong about THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING which is a cinematic masterpiece. Ignore their criticisms . Any film that is praised by people as diverse as fans of the book , people who have never read the book , enviromentalists and cynics like myself is worth your time watching . I'm really looking forward to THE TWO TOWERS"
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,11-Apr-04,"The reason why this first part of Jackson's 'Lord of the Rings' is superior to his latter two parts is because of restraint. Jackson was restrained from over doing it with the CGI and ""epic"" battle sequences, which in my opinion does not make a story epic. Part of the reason was simply because Tolkien did not have very many battles in the first part of his book, which thankfully forced Jackson to focus on creating a believable world rather than a believable hack-n-slash action movie.I don't find much entertainment in watching people mutilate each other, but I love it when a movie engages me in a world, and 'The Fellowship of the Ring' does just that. Certainly the most breathtaking scenes in the movie are the moments of patient observation, when the camera pans around and captures the beautiful settings of Middle Earth. I must give Jackson credit. He did hire some very extraordinary artists that have envisioned one of the grandest interpretations of Tolkien's world.There are about five particular moments that stick out in my mind and gave me that tingle of goosebumps down my spine when I saw them for the first time. The first is the introduction to Hobbiton. After the somewhat awkward prologue, I was beginning to have my doubts to whether the movie would live up to the book. But the movie surprised me. Hobbiton is perfect. The houses have flower patches and old fences, the roads look worn and made through decades of travel, and the Old Mill spins with the laziness of a quiet town. Every color is vibrant and every moment looks as through it was taken out of a picture book. Although I still don't agree with the particular look of the Hobbits, I believe everything else in Hobbiton is worthy of Tolkien's words.The second moment comes after Frodo's awakening in Rivendell, and the third, during the exploration of the Halls of Moria. In both moments, the camera pans away from the characters and outward into a static shot of their surroundings. The moments make us feel like we're turning our heads and gazing at the world around us just as the characters do. The golden waterfalls of the elven city mark an interesting contrast with the dark halls of the dwarfish mines, but each are inspiring in their own ways and add to feeling of being engaged in a living world.My other favorite moments come during the exploration of Lothlorien and the passage down the Anduin. And while I won't go into detail about the scenes, since they really should be experienced without any prior expectations, they are monuments in imaginative cinema. 'The Fellowship of the Ring' is one of those rare movies that I always wish I could reexperience for the first time. Unfortunately, Jackson turned away from exploring Middle Earth in his next two movies, and instead, turned to fighting and warfare. He seems to take a lot of pride in the love story and battle sequences he created in 'The Two Towers' and 'The Return of the King,' but it is was in his first movie when he really got it right. In 'The Fellowship of the Ring,' it's okay if the characters are uninteresting and have silly dialogue. Middle Earth is the star, and the characters are the ones seeing it for the first time."
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,09-Aug-05,"For those of you like myself who are fans of the books of the same name,you will not be disappointed by this movie. Unlike the animated versions that have previously been made where much of the story was condensed either for budgetary constraints or time limits, the Fellowship of the Ring while it does take a few shortcuts, there are very few. It is very exciting getting to see places that up until now have been purely figments of my imagination portrayed by someones elses imagination on the silver screen. I felt myself holding my breath waiting to see the various locations of middle earth and how others have dreamed of them. The movie does a breathtaking job in transporting the viewer to this other world and does so with magic good enough to be from the hand of Gandalf himself. Yes, there are places where for dramatic reasons or to prevent a lengthy historical context that certain events from the book were either shortened, modified or changed. These changes however do not change the storyline itself and makes for a very entertaining movie. I do feel however that if you are one of the uninitiated, it would serve you to either read the book before going, or immediately after the film pick up a copy and read it as it will provide more breadth to the story than what an almost three hour film can portray. In addition, there are several scenes in the book that while not central to the main story, add more to the lore of middle earth and help to explain some of the history leading up to the time of the story. The characterizations in the film were very well done and the choices of the actors to play the hobbits were perfect. While I was somewhat anxious to have Elijah Wood as Frodo and Sean Astin as Samwise, after seeing how well they were portrayed on film left me no doubt that these actors did a very admirable job bringing the characters to life. The majority of the cast has some English accent which was my main concern. Both the principle American actors portrayed a passable English type accent themselves which helped prevent them standing out on their own. How the filmmakers made several average height men such as Wood and Astin, and probably more so John Rhys Davies as Gimli appear much smaller than their Elvish or human companions is spellbinding. Special effects in this movie while at first don't really seem to be that obvious eventually take on a more obvious tone as the fellowship moves further into the adventure. As one would expect from a magical world, many things which we take for granted from reading the books are very difficult to accurately portray in a live action presentation. The filmmakers not only did a good job, they surpassed by far my expectations and truly made the experience an enjoyable and fulfilling one. As with any film where there will be sequels coming out, the ending left me longing for December 2002 to follow our adventurers further on their quest.I will caution parents who are thinking of taking their children to see this movie that it is not a movie made or intended for children. Much Parental Guidance and forethought should be taken before taking children under 12 to this film. Aside from a film which lasts almost three hours in length where much of the dialogue while important to the story is not well suited to entertain small children. In addition, several of the creatures created for the film will probably terrify younger audiences. If you want to take your children to see this film, I might caution you to view it without them first and then decide to take them on your own judgement. Hey, if you do see it first without them, you can see it again right? I plan on seeing it more than once anyway. All in all, this is a well developed motion picture where a great deal of thought went into it's development and execution. I am thankful to the filmmakers for having the courage to tackle such a well known, well loved story with an audience that has a very well organized preconceived notion of how they view the world of Tolkien. The filmmakers did the book justice and that is the bottom line unlike Bakshi's version of 1978 which was a disappointment at best and unfinished as it's final release turned out to be."
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,03-Jun-05,"I absolutely love this movie, partly because the acting is really good, but also for the CGI effects and the good storyline. I watched the extended version and realized that it isn't boring like some people think because some people I know think that FOTR is quite a lengthy movie because of all the talking, but in my opinion, if there's not talking, there's no story! If they just jumped to the fighting scenes without any of the introduction, then you won't know where the movie started from. I love the scenes where they get to fight, whether Orcs or Nazgul, the fighting scenes are still the climax of the movie.Another good movie to see after FOTR is TTT, of course. It is the second part of this great trilogy and there are more climatic scenes. Most probably, you'll enjoy that more than FOTR but don't shun this movie just because it's a bit lengthy.Overall, it's a great movie to see and it is really worth spending the money to buy/rent the extended/special DVD to watch too. Definitely a 10 out of 10 on my scale! Actually, in my opinion, 10/10 doesn't even come close!"
Charlie's Angels,17-Nov-19,"Hated it. Felt like I was being spoon fed woke tropes. I love Elizabeth Banks, but felt talked down to and ""at."" That aside, I was surprised there wasn't more action. My husband fell asleep next to me in the theatre and a few people walked out. Really ruined a night out."
Charlie's Angels,18-Nov-19,"Elizabeth Banks said that men don't wanna watch female hero's on the big screen.
It has nothing to do with that, and if you think so you are just blind.
It's about quality, and good writing, acting....
If the movie is good it doesn't matter who is in it!
But when you do something as cheap as this and think it will make the big bucks you can't be that smart! And to wast money on this franchise...anyone who thought this would be a good idea must be fired! Movies like this is exactly what's wrong with Hollywood! No love!
Make a good movie, but love into it! And it should work out fine! But just to complain about that men don't wanna watch it because there are females in the lead role is just embarrassing...."
Charlie's Angels,16-Nov-19,"Its not the worst movie I have ever seen but it comes close, a waste of talented stars with a bad boring script.The action isn't that great and the comedy (if you can call it that) falls flat.Men are treated like idiots / objects in the movie which is not equality, just makes it silly. Should have just been women good at being agents without disparaging men needlessly. The older Charlies Angels movies were far better in that regard."
Charlie's Angels,15-Nov-19,Felt like I ate a tide pod after seeing this movie
Charlie's Angels,19-Nov-19,"If Hollywood wants to spread the message that women are capable, then they could do so by writing normal female characters rather than whatever this is supposed to be. It's trope-filled, predictable and did absolutely nothing to improve the franchise.And no, I'm not a ""basement dwelling guy hating on a movie featuring women""... I'm just beyond tired of having to roll my eyes until they hurt when watching movies such as this one. I want to see well-written characters in well-written stories, and if they happen to be female, then so be it."
Charlie's Angels,15-Nov-19,"Kristen Stewart is not at her best like the handful of positive reviews state.Patrick Stewart is phoning it in.It's flat and boring.I enjoy watching B movies, commercial Hollywood fluff, art movies, whatever. There literally was nothing here.Giving it a two is being kind.This is like one of those movies that people do as a favor to get one they really want. It seems like everyone involved from writer, director, and all the actors did this just for contractual reasons and no one put any effort into it.So sad."
Charlie's Angels,13-Dec-19,"Hollywood just does not want to learn.
Ghostbusters was not enough. They just are junkies addicted to remaking and rebooting. Hey Hollywood, no new ideas = no new money from me.
I have learnt my lesson now.This was the most boring film since Blade Runner 2049. I am done with remakes and reboots and sequels and prequels and universes and zzzzzzz"
Charlie's Angels,23-Nov-19,Is this the best Hollywood can put together for a all female movie. You either gotta be 'bad assed' like Hustlers or funny like Bridesmaids and this was neither. This movie was TERRIBLE! I can't believe they even finished filming it.
Charlie's Angels,16-Nov-19,"Kristen Stewart doesn't have the talent nor the facial movement capabilities to to pull off this role. The movie is just all round bad. Elizabeth Banks how are you not embarrassed by this? This movie should skip ""straight to DVD"" and move onto ""straight to VHS"" so that it is never seen or heard from again."
Charlie's Angels,16-Nov-19,Another terrible manhating movie that is an embarrassment to the original. Stay away and watch the teletubbies if you want to watch something with more intellectual credibility.
Charlie's Angels,18-Nov-19,"I thought it was a passing of the torch an sequel to the awesome movies of charlie's angels...but it is not... for an action movie there is barely action in it, the acting is meh, the agenda and propaganda reached high heaven... this is bad guys...I wanted to get out of the empty theater and did in several occasions... don't even come to me to say that I'm a man and don't like females in action roles...some of my favorite action movies are from women Atomic Blonde, Tomb Ryder, Terminator, Salt, La Fame Nikita etc etc... this one just sucks."
Charlie's Angels,13-Dec-19,"Was Melissa Mcarthy as Charlie and Daisy Ridley as the lesbian love interest.
Then they could all get tattoos, pierced and shave their heads and gossip about how men are ugly.What is with the gender switch of Charlie?"
Charlie's Angels,14-Nov-19,"The McG films from the early 2000s proved that this franchise could be an enjoyable guilty please, but Elizabeth Banks and her crew of miscast ""actresses"" have totally destroyed it. This film is terrible. One of the worst of the whole year."
Charlie's Angels,13-Nov-19,"Get a comfy seat and have a sleep, most boring movie of the year, only stayed awake as my sister kept nudging me as she paid for 6 tickets. Stay home and watch Netflix or read a book"
Charlie's Angels,16-Nov-19,"Worst film by a long shot this year, & that's saying something. Not sure how Kirsten what's her face keeps getting work, her acting is awful*, she only pulled it off in twilight because she played a dead person. Save your money or give it to a homeless person instead.*she was good in panic room to be fair, but then again she was only about 12"
Charlie's Angels,06-Dec-19,"To compare this movie to a dumpster fire is being unfair. A dumpster fire is more entertaining and exciting than this piece of tripe. No, Elizabeth Banks it's not a man hating on strong women characters. I loved Wonder Woman, Tomb Raider, Aliens, Panic Room and the list goes on and on. The problem, Elizabeth Banks, is the fact you created a total crap of a movie with an agenda that is not necessary. Make a GOOD movie with a strong leading female character and we will come watch. Well, not anymore. I will never watch anything that has Banks attached to it in any manner."
Charlie's Angels,24-Dec-19,"Why would I watch this if there are prettier girls at my work, on my street and in any café??Why do you think I go to movies if not be entertained by pretty, long-haired, feminine actresses???I suggest people watch D.E.B.S., Atomic Blonde, Red Sparrow or even Road House instead of this useless reboot attempt.
PS: Patrick Stewart, what is wrong with you?"
Charlie's Angels,17-Nov-19,"Whyyyyyy?? Why are you, Sir Patrick Stewart in the same movie as Kristen Stewart?!?? You are a legend. She is a flop. Just like this movie. Drew, Lucy & Cam were much more fun."
Charlie's Angels,16-Nov-19,"At this point, one has to wonder if Hollyweird is trying to make flops?!"
Charlie's Angels,18-Nov-19,"So Elizabeth Banks told us that this movie was made for women.
Now she's blaming men for why it's tanking... Right. It's my fault this movie is another hot woke garbage remake that no one asked for and everybody hates.Hollywood is really on a roll! How many iconic franchises from the past have they dug up and destroyed lately? I've lost track."
Charlie's Angels,15-Nov-19,"I wasted my 35 minutes on cinema.... Seriously i went to wqtch this movie on big screen... But after 35 minutes i was thinking myself that it's much better to leave the cinema.... I mean the whole cast nd crew acting skills were like nah.... Overacting, plus the plot there is nothing new on this movie, nd poor sir Patrick Stewart he's totally wasted in this movie.... I mean y even he accepted the role in this movie...
My rating is 1 out 100... Not even 1 out 10... Out of 100... Lol"
Charlie's Angels,14-Dec-19,"I cannot believe I wasted 3 hours with my girlfriend on this.
What has happened to hollywood? Really what has happened? Are there no more pretty women left in the world? Does the casting manager even know how Charlie's Angels should go?? I was more into Charlie!! Finally, what is with the gender switch?Ah, whatever I don't care anymore."
Charlie's Angels,22-Nov-19,"Other obvious issues aside, this is just a horrible movie that nobody asked for or wanted.
The cast is meh, the acting is bad, the script and directing is worse than a bad lifetime movie.I am sick of Hollywood pushing out total junk and then playing the victim and blaming their failures on the fans.
Make good material, don't insult your fans by pushing your agendas and people will love and support you. It's not a difficult concept."
Charlie's Angels,14-Nov-19,"I can't believe this, watched from the start till the end and everything is just felt flat,
Kristen Stewart trying so hard to be funny, (and fail), the opener is so boring, dialog line so generic, story is weak and mainstream, action scene is boring. big names like Sr. Patrick Stewart & Djimon Hounsou not effective to the movie. I just can ""Feel"" the movie man...
the good point of this movie are just the girls are pretty, that's all.
nb: best scene : last / end of the movie (before credit)"
Charlie's Angels,17-Nov-19,"Another installment in the man bad/women good ideology we see in these undesirable reboots. What I can't figure out is why these makers of cinema haven't realised its hurting them financially as well as culturally. Save your time and money, skip this one, it's highly offensive to men."
The Wrong Missy,15-May-20,"Not every movie is supossed to be Amarcord, casablanca or even young frankenstein.
It's not a sin to enjoy a simple movie, to stop the stress fron reality, to take a detour from the horrible things going on in today's world.
You're wathching a Happy Madison production, with Sandler's friends, a simple plot and yes, a 50 something year old men dating a 35 year old woman.
But i really don't understand the hate; when i want emotion i see Cinema Paradiso. When i want to be really scared , i see the exorcist....
Today, i really wanted to scape, be relaxed, and maybe have one or two laughs.I disagree with those who said: ''she's so cringe, he's so flat, the script is non existant'' (the latter being truth). Missy as a role is supossed to be unnerving, and the moments of surprising normality from her.....well i can honestly say that i've met people like that, annoying and good persons almost at the same time.It's not a great movie, but i can honestly say, i'had some fun. And the time flew really quick,Judge some movies for what it is, not from what is suppossed to be."
The Wrong Missy,14-May-20,"So this was never meant to win an Oscar, let's be honest with ourselves. Nobody with a brain would press Play thinking this was going to blow their minds with best cinematography or acting. However it did one thing well & it did it VERY well, it made me LOL throughout the movie. The stupidest & simplest things can be worth every minute. Well done on this one, credit due there!"
The Wrong Missy,15-May-20,"I'm generally skeptical these dates of anything that Adam Sandler's name is attached to these days. While the movie itself has its shortcomings, not the least of which is Spade as the romantic lead it has a shining light: Lauren Lapkus, whose comedic performance is the superb.
It puts her alongside the best comedic actors of the moment. She completely commits to everything which means that many of the moments that would be rendered unfunny in less capable hands hit the mark or exceed it.
I will be going out of my way to watch her in the future."
The Wrong Missy,21-Jun-20,"On the recommendation of a few friends, I gave this movie a shot. After watching the entire movie, I have concluded that I probably will not take their next recommendation.I kept hearing that the first five minutes of ""The Wrong Missy"" made people laugh as much as any movie they have seen in the past few years. So, I figured I would give it five minutes, hopefully I would agree about how funny it was, and I would at least tolerate the remaining 90 minutes. But that didn't happen.Including the first five minutes, this movie never felt like anything more than a complete waste of time. Inexplicably, I continued to watch the whole movie, despising it the entire time, hardly cracking a smile.David Spade has been funny enough in certain past moments, but he is not funny here. His opportunity to elevate sunken material is limited, so it's hard to know how much blame he deserves. I will say definitively that I do not blame Lauren Lapkus for this film's failure. She commits to her role with admirable enthusiasm, never letting up for a moment. Kudos to her for trying her best. She clearly has potential. In a different role and movie, she could be very funny.I'm a big fan of Adam Sandler. Let me be clear, I'm a fan of Adam Sandler, the person. By all accounts he is a genuinely kind and humble individual, and he seems like he would be a blast to hang out with.However, many of the comedy movies he has made lately have been unwatchably awful. They have been lazy, broadly uninteresting and bafflingly stupid. And that's what ""The Wrong Missy"" is. It is relentlessly dumb. It never makes an effort to be even the tiniest bit believable.If you're a fan of Adam Sandler, I recommend watching ""Uncut Gems."" It's not his typical performance or type of movie, but it's a wild, riveting ride. If you are in the mood for a comedy, then try ""The Lovebirds."" Both of these are on Netflix now."
The Wrong Missy,13-May-20,"The names David Spade and Rob Schneider were enough to get me interested in the film. While it's not groundbreaking, this movie introduced elements that made me cringe and laugh at the same time on several occasions. Netflix has certainly delivered on this one, not a dull moment from the beginning to the end."
The Wrong Missy,14-May-20,I was expecting this to be one of the worsts movies so far this year but it was surprisingly funny. Yes some of the jokes were kinda outdated and not that good but a lot of them did make me laugh. Definitely one of the best David Spade movies I have seen in a long time so good job to him. Script was pretty predictable but overall an alright movie.
The Wrong Missy,08-Jun-20,I don't know if I feel more sorry for the writers or the actors. Can't believe a movie like this could ever be made.
The Wrong Missy,23-May-20,This one is REALLY BAD. Annoying character. Difficult to watch.
The Wrong Missy,21-May-20,It seems like there are so many drama's on TV and very few comedies. This had me laughing out loud through most of the movie. It's worth 90 minutes of your time.
The Wrong Missy,14-Jun-20,"Please don't blame the actress for this train wreck of a script. How did this even get made? Sad for women. Sad for Adam Sandler's aging ""wolf pack"". Sad for screen writers. Please just stop."
The Wrong Missy,15-May-20,"The Wrong Missy (3 out of 5 stars).The Wrong Missy is a fair comedy film that is filled with stupid humor which is what you can expect from a Happy Madison production. A comedy movie that does have that typical predictable story and cliches but it is kind of entertaining.The plot follows Tim (David Spade) who had a bad blind date when he met Melissa (Lauren Lapkus) with her loud, obnoxious, and weird personality. Months later, he meets another woman Melissa (Molly Sims) which her personality is like his dream woman. They swapped numbers and went there own ways in the airport. When his company is throwing a retreat in Hawaii. He decides to invite Melissa. Which he gets a surprise in the airport when Melissa from the blind date shows up. Which she tries to take charge of every situation she is in at his work party.It is a predictable plot which you can tell who is going to get with who before it happens. Tim has an enemy at work which she hates him and is always trying to be better than him in front of there boss. She will be a conflict to Tim's secret about Missy and his dream girl Melissa. Tim and Missy are the opposites. He is quiet and passive. She is loud and clumsy.Missy played by Lauren Lapkus is entertaining. She may act stupid and have that loud personality. Sometimes her performance may be overboard trying to get laughs. Which may be annoying than funny. She did decent with the character. David Spade, Molly Sims, Nick Swardson, and even Rob Schneider did decent with the performances. May not be great acting. But they are all entertaining with having fun with their characters.If you seen previous Happy Madison production movies that Adam Sandler produced and enjoyed it. Than you will enjoy this as well. Simple predictable plot. With actors having fun with their characters. And plenty of dumb humor."
The Wrong Missy,03-Jun-20,Complete over acting by Lauren Lapkus. She was annoying from start to finish.
The Wrong Missy,07-Jun-20,"A very low budget film, terrible plot and acting, not funny just embarrassing, another Netflix below average movie to the below average viewers, beware and and do not waste your time on this thing!!!"
The Wrong Missy,13-May-20,"I guess you have to be a Happy Madison and company fan to truly enjoy and appreciate this like I did. I grew up watching these guys and David Spade always delivers. As always, the usually suspects showed up to make it another comedic classic under the HM umbrella. Great cameo at the end too if you're from this generation of comedy gold."
The Wrong Missy,14-May-20,David Spade in his trademark role-straight man to a crazed over the top funnyman (funnywoman)-Lauren Lapkus shines as the force of nature and overall it was a lot of laughs. I hope they make a sequel.
The Wrong Missy,13-May-20,Lauren lapkus is too annoying. Their is a difference in funny and annoying she is Obnoxious. she messed up the movie completely. NOT a good thing
The Wrong Missy,31-May-20,"I honestly cannot understand how anyone can think this movie is worth watching.
Although the original story is reasonable the plot degenerates to kindergarten slapstick.
The acting is totally over the top and... I really can't think of anything good to say about it..... sorry."
The Wrong Missy,13-May-20,"Better than i espected!Beside she is yelling all the time,the movie has a lot of dirty and really funny dialogs and situations from the beginning 'till the end!Sandler's pack rules!"
The Wrong Missy,22-May-20,Wrong Movie. Waste of time. Funny? Not really. We could have watch a better movie than this. Trying too hard to make us laugh. So annoying and just can't let it pass not to comment about it so I might save human race not to watch such a garbage of a movie.
The Wrong Missy,12-Jun-20,"I don't often write reviews, I normally just rate and move on. My wife and I watched the trailer and found it funny, however, less than 30 minutes in we turned off. Lapkus is far too annoying, that gradually we felt we were losing braincells. She reminded us of Gina in Brooklyn, but no where near as intelligent, but just as annoying.I can't add much else, watch the trailer, get some laughs and you'll be set. Just don't bother with the actual film, it is awful."
The Wrong Missy,01-Jun-20,"No words, it was horrible, not even laughed once and it was so stupid, don't waste your time watching it. It's a mess, who wrote this film?"
The Wrong Missy,13-May-20,"It is a good movie to spend a happy time. Better than I believe. I like Netflix movies, they are improving and you have a cinema at home every week"
The Wrong Missy,22-May-20,"If you have brain cells, avoid this movie at all costs"
The Wrong Missy,16-May-20,"Then I'm Leslie Nielsen.I should've been discouraged by the Happy Madison logo right at the beginning but I thought David Spade And Rob Schneider might add some laughs to the movie so I pressed on. But, 25 minutes into the movie, and I can't for the love of god understand who finds this funny. They rely on the same old, worn out, vulgar jokes and over the top characters. Like, don't you have any sense of integrity as an actor? I get you have bills to pay but have some self respect."
The Wrong Missy,16-May-20,Just finished watching this. I felt compelled to make an account just for this movie. It's a piece of misogynistic garbage stuck in 2003 with outdated comedy. It's so bad...the group of people watching this with me were just baffled. It's not even funny drunk.
